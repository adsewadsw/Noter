# How to Use this Site to Understand Hegel

Unfortunately, Lenin's famous aphorism: “[It is impossible completely to understand Marx's _Capital_, and especially its first chapter, without having thoroughly studied and understood the _whole_ of Hegel's _Logic_. Consequently, half a century later none of the Marxists understood Marx!!](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_180a)” is more true today and more pressing in its significance than when it was written 80 years ago.

Most Marxists will tell you that Hegel invented dialectics and that he was an ‘objective idealist’, but very, very few have actually read Hegel. However, Marx and Engels wrote very little by way of _explaining_ Hegel’s ideas (Engels’ [Socialism: Utopian& Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm), § II and § I of [Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm) are the best general introductions available), but we know from Marx’s 1843 [Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm) and his 1844 [Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy in General](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/hegel.htm) that Marx formed his own view by way of a critique of Hegel, and the 1859 [Grundrisse](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm), Marx’s preparatory notes for _Capital_ make it clear that the critique of Hegel was central to his thinking throughout his life.

There is no short-cut to understanding Hegel other than reading him in the original or in translation. This site offers you a number of different ways to “get into” Hegel:

### Engels’ Explanations:

##### [Socialism: Utopian& Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm), § II and  
§ I of [Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm).

Both these books are excellent short introductions to Marxism and the sections referred to deal with [dialectics](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/isms.htm#dialectics) and the historical origins of dialectical thinking. The main menu above allows you to view [a range of Marx/Engels writings on Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/li_marx.htm); some of Engels’s other writings on dialectics are too simplistic for someone who intends to read Hegel, and most of Marx’s references are best returned to _after_ you have familiarised yourself with some of Hegel’s writing, except for the short pieces on the [Method of Political Economy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm#loc3) and on the [Method of Presentation](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm#3b)

### Reading Hegel from the top

The main menu above allows you to view [list of Hegel’s main works](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/li_hegel.htm), all of which are available on this site

- In his [Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ol/encycind.htm), Hegel set out his ideas about all subjects in a systematic way. The three main part are Logic, Nature and Spirit. The [Introduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm) is a good way into Hegel’s philosophy.  
    Logic is divided into Being, Essence and Notion, — Nature into Mathematics, Inorganic & Organic Physics, and — Spirit into Subjective Spirit, Objective Spirit (also called the _Philosophy of Right_ which includes Hegel's political and economic views) and Absolute Spirit. Browsing this page will give you an idea of the scope of his writings.

As a result of Lenin’s study of the _Logic_, many Marxists are already somewhat familar with aspects of Hegel’s _Logic_, and this is a good route into reading Hegel.  
Hegel gives you the Logic in three steps:

- Just browsing the [Analytical Table of Contents](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slconten.htm) of the Shorter Logic, which includes a one-line summary of each paragraph is a quick way into the _Logic_;
- The [Logic in Outline](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ol/ol_logic.htm) a very brief explanation of the _Logic_, which will not be sufficient for you to really _understand_ the Logic, but gives you an introduction in Hegel's own words. Personally, I find the Outlines _too_ brief and schematic to be comprehensible;
- The **main**, recommended reading is the [Shorter Logic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/sl_index.htm). I recommend that after reading the _Shorter Logic_ beginning from the [Introduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm), you skip through until you understand the drift or meaning of the **three parts** of the logic: [Being](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm), [Essence](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm) & the [Notion](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slsubjec.htm). You need to get a fix on these three concepts to be able to get your bearings. In reading Hegel, it is important not only _what_ Hegel says, but even more importantly, _where_ he says it, because Hegel is not interested in proving this or that statement to be true, but rather to understand how each specific insight is but a part of the development of truth, — and the whole system is made up of triads within triads within triads. So you have to work out where you in each triad, to make sense of what you are reading;
- Finally, the _Science of Logic_, written in 1812 the “Larger Logic” remains the definitive statement of Hegel’s system, and its concepts run through all his work. However, its 884 pages of strictly triadic, dry text, completely lacking in any examples or common-language explanations, it is heavy reading!

The file structure of my transcription of the logic invites you to read through, skipping over a lot of detail taken up in files accessed via links and all the passages quoted by Lenin, and endlessly recycled by other Marxists, and all the other frequently cited passages, with hypertext links to the relevant Marxist commentary, are found on this "main road" through the Logic, which include the last few sections in full.

Alternatively, you might like to start with Hegel's defence of constiutional monarchy, [The Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prconten.htm), if you prefer to read about _people_ and social issues, rather than “logic”.

The _Philosophy of Right_ is Hegel’s theory on law, politics and political economy. The [Introduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm) to this work is possibly one of the best introductions to Hegel's philosophy for the modern reader. Hegel thought that if a social system was ‘unreasonable’, then it would be bound to come into crisis. So history was itself a working out of Reason in the World. Marx's earliest writing (after his doctoral thesis which criticised Hegel by way of a study of the materialist philosophers of ancient Greece), was his [_Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/ch01.htm). In the _Philosophy of Right_, Hegel’s views are quite explicit as regards political, history, political economy, social justice, the State, and so on, and is really the logical starting point for any socialist wanting to understand Hegel. For Hegel, the principles manifested in the _Objective Spirit_ are already fully explained in the _Logic_ which should be read _first_, but really, it is Hegel's early _political_ criticism which makes his Logic comprehensible!

- Try browsing the [Analytical Table of Contents](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prconten.htm) of the _Philosophy of Right_, which includes a one-line summary of each paragraph;
- The [_Objective Spirit_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/osindex.htm) from the _Encyclopedia_ is Hegel’s short summary and is relatively light reading, and is recommended.
- The [_Philosophy of Right_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/prindex.htm) is not too hard to read, and the sections on [Civil Society](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm) and on the [State](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm) are important.

The [_Phenomenology_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/phindex.htm) is Hegel’s first complete publication and contains everything that is found in his later works. The _Phenomenology_ is particularly important to the French Hegelians and those who are interested in Hegel's aesthetics, and contains the famous passage on the [Master-Slave dialectic](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#master-slave-dialectic). It is a very difficult work and very large, but the [Introduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phintro.htm) is very readable and a good introduction to Hegel’s philosophy in itself. Many readers will want to go straight to the [The Master-Slave Dialectic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phba.htm), but it is important in reading this passage to understand what Hegel means by “subject,” and it is recommended to read the early [_System of Ethical Life_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/se/index.htm) first.

The [_Outline of the Phenomenology_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ol/ol_phen.htm) is Hegel’s short synopsis of the _Phenomenology_.

Finally, the lesser known [_Philosophy of Nature_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/natindex.htm) is included for the avid student!

Remember, whenever you are reading Hegel, after orienting yourself by reading the Preliminary paragraphs in each work, browse through the whole book to identify the principal triads of which the whole book is constructed. Hegel cannot really be read straight through like other writers.

Happy reading! .. You might like to start your reading of Hegel with this excerpt from the Introduction to the _Shorter Logic_:

##### from the Introduction to The Shorter Logic, by Hegel

#### § 6

... [Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/hints.htm#philosophy) should understand that its content is no other than [_actuality_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL142), that core of truth which [originally produced and producing itself within the precincts of the mental life, has become the _world_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm#003), the inward and [outward world](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/hints.htm#nature), of consciousness. At first we become aware of these contents in what we call [Experience](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#experience). But even Experience, as it surveys the wide range of inward and outward existence, has sense enough to distinguish the mere [appearance](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slappear.htm#SL131), which is transient and meaningless, from what in itself really deserves the name of [actuality](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/hints.htm#actuality).

---

As it is only in form that philosophy is distinguished from other modes of attaining an acquaintance with this same sum of being, it must necessarily be in harmony with actuality and experience. In fact, this harmony may be viewed as at least an extrinsic means of testing the [truth](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#truth) of a philosophy. Similarly it may be held the highest and final aim of philosophic science to bring about, through the ascertainment of this harmony, a reconciliation of the [self-conscious reason](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#self-consciousness) which _is_ in the [world](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_92) - in other words, with actuality.

---

In the Preface to my _Philosophy of Law_, p xix, are found the propositions:

[What is rational is actual.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#002)  
and  
What is actual is rational.

---

These simple statements have given rise to expressions of surprise and hostility, even in quarters where it would be reckoned an insult to presume absence of philosophy, and still more of religion. [Religion](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#religion) at least need not be brought in evidence; its doctrines of the divine governments of the world affirm these propositions too decidedly. For their philosophic sense, we must presuppose intelligence enough to know, not only that [God](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#god) is actual, that He is the supreme actuality, that He alone is truly actual; but also, as regards the logical bearings of the question, that existence is in part mere [appearance](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slappear.htm#SL131n), and only in part actuality.

---

In common life, any freak of fancy, any [error](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#error), evil and everything of the nature of evil, as well as every degenerate and transitory existence whatever, gets in a casual way the name of actuality. But even our ordinary feelings are enough to forbid a casual (fortuitous) existence getting the emphatic name of an actual; for by [fortuitous](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#chance) we mean an existence which has no greater value than that of something [possible](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL143), which may as well not be as be.

---

As for the term [Actuality](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL142n), these critics would have done well to consider the sense in which I employ it. In a detailed _Logic_ I had treated among other things of actuality, and accurately distinguished it not only from the [fortuitous](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL144), which, after all, has existence, but even from the cognate categories of [existence](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#SL122) and the other [modifications](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/hints.htm#modifications) of being.

---

The actuality of the rational stands opposed by the popular fancy that [Idea](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL142n) and ideals are nothing but chimeras, and philosophy a mere system of such phantasms. It is also opposed by the very different fancy that Ideas and ideals are something far too excellent to have actuality, or something too impotent to procure it for themselves. This divorce between idea and [reality](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL91n) is especially dear to the [analytic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#analysis) understanding which looks upon its own [abstractions](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/hints.htm#abstract), dreams though they are, as something true and real, and prides itself on the imperative 'ought', which it takes especial pleasure in prescribing even on the field of politics. As if the world had waited on it to learn how it ought to be, and was not! For, if it were as it ought to be, what would come of the precocious wisdom of that ['ought'?](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slidea.htm#SL234n)

---

When understanding turns this 'ought' against trivial external and transitory objects, against social regulations or conditions, which very likely possess a great relative importance for a certain time and special circles, it may often be right. In such a case the intelligent observer may meet much that fails to satisfy the general requirements of right; for who is not acute enough to see a great deal in his own surroundings which is really far from being as it ought to be? But such acuteness is mistaken in the conceit that, when it examines these objects and pronounces what they ought to be, it is dealing with questions of philosophic science.

---

The object of philosophy is the Idea: and the Idea is not so impotent as merely to have a right or an obligation to exist without actually existing. The object of philosophy is an actuality of which those objects, [social regulations](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#tax) and conditions, are only the superficial outside.

## Dialectics

Dialectics is the method of reasoning which aims to understand things [concretely](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/b.htm#abstract) in all their movement, change and interconnection, with their opposite and contradictory sides in unity.

Dialectics is opposed to the [formal](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/f/o.htm#formalism), [metaphysical](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/e.htm#metaphysics) mode of thought of [ordinary understanding](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/u/n.htm#understanding) which begins with a fixed definition of a thing according to its various attributes. For example formal thought would explain: ‘a fish is something with no legs which lives in the water’.

[Darwin](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/d/a.htm#darwin-charles) however, considered fish dialectically: some of the animals living in the water were not fish, and some of the fish had legs, but it was the [_genesis_](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/g/e.htm#genetic) of all the animals as part of a whole interconnected process which explained the nature of a fish: they _came from_ something and are _evolving into_ something else.

Darwin went behind the _appearance_ of fish to get to their [essence](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/e/s.htm#essence). For ordinary understanding there is no difference between the [appearance](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/p.htm#appearance) of a thing and its [essence](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/e/s.htm#essence), but for dialectics the [form and content](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/f/o.htm#form) of something can be quite contradictory – parliamentary democracy being the prime example: democracy in form, but dictatorship in content!

And for dialectics, things can be contradictory not just in appearance, but in _essence_. For formal thinking, light must be either a wave _or_ a particle; but the truth turned out to be dialectical – light is both wave _and_ particle. (See [the principle of excluded middle](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/e/x.htm#excluded))

We are aware of countless ways of understanding the world; each of which makes the claim to be _the_ [absolute truth](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/b.htm#absolute-truth), which leads us to think that, after all, “It’s all [relative](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/b.htm#absolute)!”. For dialectics the truth is the _whole picture_, of which each view is a more or less one-sided, partial aspect.

At times, people complain in frustration that they lack the Means to achieve their Ends, or alternatively, that they can justify their corrupt methods of work by the lofty aims they pursue. For dialectics, [Means and Ends](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/e.htm#means) are a [unity of opposites](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/u/n.htm#unity-of-opposites) and in the final analysis, there can be no contradiction between means and ends – when the objective is rightly understood, "the material conditions [_means_] for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation" (Marx, [Preface of Contribution to a Political Economy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm))

An example of dialectical reasoning can be seen in Lenin's slogan: “All Power to the Soviets” spoken when the Soviets were _against_ the Bolsheviks. Lenin understood, however, that the impasse could only be resolved by workers’ power. Since the Soviets were organs of workers’ power, a revolutionary initiative by the Bolsheviks would inevitably bring the Soviets to their side: the _form_ of the Soviets during the time (lead by Mensheviks and SRs) were at odds with the [_content_](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm#content) of the Soviets as Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Councils.

Formal thinking often has trouble understanding the causes of events – something has to be a cause and something else the effect – and people are surprised when they irrigate land and 20 years later – due to salination of the land, silting of the waterways, etc – they have a desert! Dialectics on the other hand understands that [cause and effect](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#causality) are just one and another side of a whole network of relations such as we have in an ecosystem, and one thing cannot be changed without changing the whole system.

These are different aspect of Dialectics, and there are many others, because dialectics is the method of thinking in which concepts are flexible and mobile, constrained only by the imperative of comprehending the movement of the object itself, however contradictory, however transient.

History: Dialectics has its origins in [ancient society](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm), both among the [Chinese](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/t/a.htm#taoism) and the [Greeks](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#heraclitus), where thinkers sought to understand Nature as a whole, and saw that everything is fluid, constantly changing, coming into being and passing away. It was only when the piecemeal method of observing Nature in bits and pieces, practiced in Western thinking in the 17th and 18th century, had accumulated enough [positive knowledge](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/o.htm#positive) for the interconnections, the transitions, the genesis of things to become comprehensible, that conditions became ripe for modern dialectics to make its appearance. It was Hegel who was able to sum up this picture of [universal](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/u/n.htm#universal) interconnection and mutability of things in a [system](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/y.htm#system) of _Logic_ which is the foundation of what we today call Dialectics.

As Engels put it:

“the whole world, natural, historical, intellectual, is represented as a process – i.e., as in constant motion, change, transformation, development; and the attempt is made to trace out the internal connection that makes a continuous whole of all this movement and development.” [[Socialism: Utopian & Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm)]

It was in the decade after Hegel’s death – the 1840s – when Hegel’s popularity was at its peak in Germany, that Marx and Engels met and worked out the foundations of their critique of bourgeois society.

Hegel’s radical [young followers](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/y/o.htm#young-hegelians) had in their hands a powerful critical tool with which they ruthlessly criticised Christianity, the dominant doctrine of the day. However, one of these Young Hegelians, [Ludwig Feuerbach](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/e.htm#feuerbach-ludwig), pointed out that _Holy Family_ was after all only a Heavenly image of the Earthly family, and said that by criticising theology with philosophy, the Young Hegelians were only doing the same as the Christians – Hegel’s [Absolute Idea](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/b.htm#absolute-idea) was just another name for [God](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/g/o.htm#god)! For Feuerbach, ideas were a [reflection](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/e.htm#reflection) of the material world and he held it to be ridiculous [that an Idea could determine the world](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#objective-idealism). Feuerbach had declared himself a [materialist](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#materialism).

Marx and Engels began as supporters of Feuerbach. However, very soon they took up an [opposition to Feuerbach](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm) to restore the Hegelian dialectic which had been abandoned by Feuerbach, and to free it from the rigidity of the [idealistic](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/i/d.htm#idealism) Hegelian [system](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/y.htm#system) and place the method on a materialist basis:

“Hegel was an idealist. To him, the thoughts within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual things and processes, but, conversely, things and their evolution were only the realized pictures of the ‘Idea’, existing somewhere from eternity before the world was. This way of thinking turned everything upside down, and completely reversed the actual connection of things in the world. ” [Fredrick Engels, [Socialism: Utopian and Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm)]

Thus, for Marx and Engels, thoughts were not passive and independent reflections of the material world, but products of human labour, and the contradictory nature of our thoughts had their origin in the contradictions within human society. This meant that Dialectics was not something imposed on to the world from outside which could be discovered by the activity of pure [Reason](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/e.htm#reason), but was a product of human labour changing the world; its form was changed and developed by people, and could only be understood by the practical struggle to overcome these contradictions – not just in thought, but in [practice](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#practice).

## Materialism

Those philosophical trends which emphasise the material world (the world outside of consciousness) as the foundation and determinant of thinking, especially in relation to the question of the origin of knowledge. Compare with [idealism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/i/d.htm#idealism). For materialism, thoughts are “[reflections](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/e.htm#reflection)” of [matter](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#matter), outside of Mind, which existed before and independently of thought. According the Marx:

“The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism - that of Feuerbach included - is that the thing, reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the _object or of contemplation_, but not as _sensuous human activity, practice_, not subjectively.”  
[[_Theses on Feuerbach_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm#001)].

## Dialectical Materialism

Dialectical Materialism is a way of understanding reality; whether thoughts, emotions, or the material world. Simply stated, this methodology is the combination of **[Dialectics](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dialectics)** and **[Materialism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#materialism)**. The materialist dialectic is the [theoretical](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/t/h.htm#theory) foundation of [Marxism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#marxism) (while being [communist](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/c/o.htm#communist) is the [practice](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#practice) of Marxism).

"It is an eternal cycle in which matter moves, a cycle that certainly only completes its orbit in periods of time for which our terrestrial year is no adequate measure, a cycle in which the time of highest development, the time of organic life and still more that of the life of being conscious of nature and of themselves, is just as narrowly restricted as the space in which life and self-consciousness come into operation. A cycle in which every finite mode of existence of matter, whether it be sun or nebular vapour, single animal or genus of animals, chemical combination or dissociation, is equally transient, and wherein nothing is eternal but eternally changing, eternally moving matter and the laws according to which it moves and changes.

Fredrick Engels  
[Dialectics of Nature](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/index.htm)  
[Introduction](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch01.htm)

"Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there be."

"Change of form of motion is always a process that takes place between at least two bodies, of which one loses a definite quantity of motion of one quality (e.g. heat), while the other gains a corresponding quantity of motion of another quality (mechanical motion, electricity, chemical decomposition).

"Dialectics, so-called _objective_ dialectics, prevails throughout nature, and so-called subjective dialectics (dialectical thought), is only the reflection of the motion through opposites which asserts itself everywhere in nature, and which by the continual conflict of the opposites and their final passage into one another, or into higher forms, determines the life of nature."

Fredrick Engels  
Dialectics of Nature

But dialectical materialism insists on the approximate relative character of every scientific theory of the structure of matter and its properties; it insists on the absence of absolute boundaries in nature, on the transformation of moving matter from one state into another, that from our point of view [may be] apparently irreconcilable with it, and so forth.

Vladimir Lenin  
[Materialism and Empirio-criticism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/05.htm)

With each epoch-making discovery even in the sphere of natural science, materialism has to change its form; and after history was also subjected to materialistic treatment, a new avenue of development has opened here, too. [[Ch. 2, The End of Classical German Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch02.htm#010)]

"For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher."

Fredrick Engels  
[The End of Classical German Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/index.htm)

An example of dialectical materialism applied is the [materialist conception of history](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/h/i.htm#historical-materialism) .

'Dialectical Materialism' was coined by [Karl Kautsky](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/k/a.htm#kautsky-karl) and popularised in the Second International after the death of Marx and Engels.

### Historical Materialism

"This conception of history depends on our ability to expound the real process of production, starting out from the material production of life itself, and to comprehend the form of intercourse connected with this and created by this mode of production (i.e. civil society in its various stages), as the basis of all history; describing it in its action as the state, and to explain all the different theoretical products and forms of consciousness, religion, philosophy, ethics, etc. etc. arise from it, and trace their origins and growth from that basis. Thus the whole thing can, of course, be depicted in its totality (and therefore, too, the reciprocal action of these various sides on one another).

"It has not, like the idealistic view of history, in every period to look for a category [eg. measuring periods of history in accordance to certain ideas], but remains constantly on the real ground of history; it does not explain practice from the idea but explains the formation of ideas from material practice. Accordingly it comes to the conclusion that all forms and products of consciousness cannot be dissolved by mental criticism, by resolution into "self-consciousness" or transformation into "apparitions", "spectres", "whims", etc. but only by the practical overthrow of the actual social relations which gave rise to this idealistic humbug; that not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history, also of religion, of philosophy and all other types of theory.

"It shows that history does not end by being resolved into "self-consciousness as spirit of the spirit", but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, an historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor; a mass of productive forces, capital funds and conditions, which, on the one hand, is indeed modified by the new generation, but also on the other prescribes for it its conditions of life and gives it a definite development, a special character. It shows that circumstances make men just as much as men make circumstances.

Karl Marx  
[The German Ideology](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01.htm)  
[Chpt 2: Civil Society and the Conception of History](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm)

"The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature."

"Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.

"The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode of production must not be considered simply as being the production of the physical existence of the individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form of expressing their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.

Karl Marx  
[The German Ideology](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01.htm)  
[Chpt 1: Idealism and Materialism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm)

"At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production, or – what is but a legal expression for the same thing – with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters.

"No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself. Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found that the tasks itself arises only when the material conditions of its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation.

History Repeats Itself?

Marx never believed that “history repeats itself,” but in a famous quote he said:

“Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” [Marx, _18th Brumaire of Louis Bonapatre_, [Chapter 1](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm).]

This seems to come from [Engels’ letter to Marx](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1851/letters/51_12_03.htm#cite) of 3 December 1851:

“it really seems as though old Hegel, in the guise of the World Spirit, were directing history from the grave and, with the greatest conscientiousness, causing everything to be re-enacted twice over, once as grand tragedy and the second time as rotten farce, Caussidière for Danton, L. Blanc for Robespierre, Barthélemy for Saint-Just, Flocon for Carnot, and the moon-calf together with the first available dozen debt-encumbered lieutenants for the little corporal and his band of marshals. Thus the 18th Brumaire would already be upon us.”

– words quoted almost verbatim by Marx in [Eighteenth of Louis Bonapartre](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm).

Marx makes similar points in _Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_, [Introduction](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm#19).

Possible sources in Hegel are _The Philosophy of Right_, [§347](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR347) and _The Philosophy of History_, [§32-33](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history3.htm#032) though another version of this work published as _Introduction to The Philosophy of History_, published in 1837, said:

“A coup d’état is sanctioned as it were in the opinion of the people if it is repeated. Thus, Napoleon was defeated twice and twice the Bourbons were driven out. Through repetition, what at the beginning seemed to be merely accidental and possible, becomes real and established.”

but this is hardly the point being made by Marx. See [_The Philosophy of History_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history5.htm), where Hegel contrasts Nature, where “there is nothing new under the Sun,” with History where there is always Development.

History

[Humans] must be in a position to live in order to be able to "make history". But life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things. The first historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs, the production of material life itself. And indeed this is an historical act, a fundamental condition of all history, which today, as thousands of years ago, must daily and hourly be fulfilled merely in order to sustain human life.

The second point is that the satisfaction of the first need (the action of satisfying, and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs; and this production of new needs is the first historical act.

The third circumstance which, from the very outset, enters into historical development, is that [humans], who daily remake their own life, begin to make other [humans], to propagate their kind: the relation between man and woman, parents and children, the family. The family, which to begin with is the only social relationship, becomes later, when increased needs create new social relations and the increased population new needs, a subordinate one, and must then be treated and analysed according to the existing empirical data... These three aspects of social activity are not of course to be taken as three different stages, but just as three aspects... which have existed simultaneously since the dawn of history and the first [humans], and which still assert themselves in history today.

The production of life, both of one's own in labour and of fresh life in procreation, now appears as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions, in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode of production, or industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and this mode of co-operation is itself a "productive force". Further, that the multitude of productive forces accessible to [humans] determines the nature of society, hence, that the "history of humanity" must always be studied and treated in relation to the history of industry and exchange.

In history up to the present it is certainly an empirical fact that separate individuals have, with the broadening of their activity into world-historical activity, become more and more enslaved under a power alien to them (a pressure which they have conceived of as a dirty trick on the part of the so-called universal spirit, etc.), a power which has become more and more enormous and, in the last instance, turns out to be the world market. But it is just as empirically established that, by the overthrow of the existing state of society by the communist revolution (of which more below) and the abolition of private property which is identical with it, this power, which so baffles the German theoreticians, will be dissolved; and that then the liberation of each single individual will be accomplished in the measure in which history becomes transformed into world history.

Slavery cannot be abolished without the steam-engine and the mule and spinning-jenny, serfdom cannot be abolished without improved agriculture, and that, in general, people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable to obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and quantity. "Liberation" is an historical and not a mental act, and it is brought about by historical conditions, the development of industry, commerce, agriculture...

[German Ideology](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm), Chpt. 1, Marx and Engels

The economic situation is the basis, but the various elements of the superstructure — political forms of the class struggle and its results, to wit: constitutions established by the victorious class after a successful battle... political, juristic, philosophical theories, religious views and their further development into systems of dogmas — also exercise their influence upon the course of the historical struggles and in many cases preponderate in determining their form. There is an interaction of all these elements in which, amid all the endless host of accidents (that is, of things and events whose inner interconnection is so remote or so impossible of proof that we can regard it as non-existent, as negligible), the economic movement finally asserts itself as necessary.

In the second place, however, history is made in such a way that the final result always arises from conflicts between many individual wills, of which each in turn has been made what it is by a host of particular conditions of life. Thus there are innumerable intersecting forces, an infinite series of parallelograms of forces which give rise to one resultant — the historical event. This may again itself be viewed as the product of a power which works as a whole unconsciously and without volition. For what each individual wills is obstructed by everyone else, and what emerges is something that no one willed... an aggregate mean, a common resultant... each contributes to the resultant and is to this extent included in it.

[Engels to J. Bloch In Königsberg](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1890/letters/90_09_21.htm)

History is the science and art of story telling past recorded events based on a critical examination of source materials. The bias of any history principally begins with the historian's philosophical premises, and the range and quality of source materials available.

One broad example of historical bias can be found simply in the _subject_ of history — from the historian who details events of kings and queens, presidents and premiers, implicitly positing that history is primarily about leaders rather than the life of the [masses](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/v/a.htm#vanguard).

"[People] make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like an nightmare on the brains of the living."

[Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm), by Karl Marx

The Marxist study of history seeks both the elucidate the conditions, and _first and foremost the material conditions_ under which historical struggles are fought, and then to identify the agents who make history. For Marxists, the agents or "subjects" of history are not focused only on the prominent individuals whose voices speak the aims and consciousness of the masses, nor on masses of people trapped by circumstance, and nor on the ideas which animate people; but specific unities of all three. The "subjects of history" are self-conscious masses of people, whose ideas and aims are inherited from the past and given new form in the voices of individual spokespersons and leaders. No one of these three aspects of an historical subject can be active without the others: a mass of people without organisation and without a consciousness of its own demands cannot make history, and nor can a "leader" who does not voice the aspirations of masses. The subjects of history are not the "forces of production" nor the "laws of history," but instead people make history always acting under certain material and spiritual conditions. It is these conditions and how people sought to change them which give meaning to the stories that are told in history.

Regardless of their philosophical premises, historians must invariably exhibit the influence of a set of ideas or moral lessons that can be derived from their presentation of history: for example, the great Chinese historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien often interlaced his historical work with [Taoist](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/t/a.htm#taoism) morality and support for a certain practice of [dialectics](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dialectics) by introducing conflicting historical lessons.

The source material of history take three distinct forms: primary, secondary, and tertiary sources.

A **primary source** is concrete evidence created by a participant, subject, or observer of an event. Primary sources can take different forms, some of which are more reliable than others. For example: a reporter's dispatch in the heat of a revolution, versus the memoirs of the former ruler written decades later; a photograph versus an impassioned painter. Primary sources closest to the events, and generally considered most reliable, take the form of artifacts, photographs, audio or video recordings, and other media which allow for less bias than other forms.

Second in ranking in terms of reliability can be found in journals, books, magazine and newspaper articles, speeches, interviews, surveys, letters, memos, and manuscripts. While each of these _always_ present varying levels of bias, scope and interpretation, they represent the real, existing bias of that participant at the time. Thus, in a "true" canvassing of history, primary sources from a variety of positions are necessary.

Lastly, memoirs and autobiographies generally introduce more bias and revisionism than works recorded at the time, due to fading memories and recent developments. Meanwhile, government and organisational records and statistics are a mixed bag, but generally help to provide an overall baseline of existing conditions.

A **secondary source** is a historical work that interprets or analyzes historical events without having any direct connection to that event, but that largely bases itself on primary sources. An Encyclopedia is the best example of a secondary source that aims to be an objective summation of primary sources, while the diligent and dedicated historian also produces secondary sources for the purpose of shedding light on, and enabling an easier digestion of, primary source material.

The last category of history is the **tertiary source**, and these works mainly rely on secondary sources or on other tertiary sources, to tell their story of history. "Popular" and strongly opinionated histories often take this form. These forms of history are the farthest removed from evidence of the events they describe, and make up the most common type of history.

The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts (see the quotation from Philo on [Heraclitus](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#heraclitus) at the beginning of Section III, “On Cognition,” in [Lasalle’s](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/l/a.htm#lassalle) book on Heraclitus[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#f1)) is the _essence_ (one of the “essentials,” one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of dialectics. That is precisely how [Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#gfw-hegel), too, puts the matter ([Aristotle](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/a/r.htm#aristotle) in his _Metaphysics_ continually _grapples_ with it and _combats_ Heraclitus and Heraclitean ideas).

The correctness of this aspect of the content of [dialectics](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dialectics) must be tested by the history of science. This aspect of dialectics (e.g. in [Plekhanov](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/p/l.htm#plekhanov)) usually receives inadequate attention: the identity of opposites is taken as the sum-total of _examples_ **[**“for example, a seed,” “for example, primitive communism.” The same is true of [Engels](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/e/n.htm#engels). But it is “in the interests of popularisation...”**]** and not as a _law of cognition_ (and as a law of the objective world).

|In mathematics: + and —. Differential and integral.  <br>In mechanics: action and reaction.  <br>In physics: positive and negative electricity.  <br>In chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms.  <br>In social science: the class struggle.|

The [identity of opposites](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/u/n.htm#unity-of-opposites) (it would be more correct, perhaps, to say their “unity,”—although the difference between the terms identity and unity is not particularly important here. In a certain sense both are correct) is the recognition (discovery) of the contradictory, _mutually exclusive_, opposite tendencies in _all_ phenomena and processes of nature (_including_ mind and society). The condition for the knowledge of all processes of the world in their “_self-movement,_” in their spontaneous development, in their real life, is the knowledge of them as a unity of opposites. Development is the “struggle” of opposites. The two basic (or two possible? Or two historically observable?) conceptions of development (evolution) are: development as decrease and increase, as repetition, _and_ development as a unity of opposites (the division of a unity into mutually exclusive opposites and their reciprocal relation).

In the first conception of motion, _self_ - movement, its _driving_ force, its source, its motive, remains in the shade (or this source is made _external_—God, subject, etc.). In the second conception the chief attention is directed precisely to knowledge of the source of _“self”_ - movement.

The first conception is lifeless, pale and dry. The second is living. The second _alone_ furnishes the key to the “self-movement” of everything existing; it alone furnishes the key to “leaps,” to the “break in continuity,” to the “transformation into the opposite,” to the destruction of the old and the emergence of the new.

The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute.

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_NB_: The distinction between [subjectivism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/u.htm#subjective) (scepticism, sophistry, etc.) and dialectics, incidentally, is that in ([objective](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#objective)) dialectics the difference between the [relative and the absolute](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/b.htm#absolute) is itself relative. For objective dialectics there _is_ an absolute _within_ the relative. For subjectivism and sophistry the relative is only relative and excludes the absolute.|

In his [_Capital_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm), Marx first analyses the simplest, most ordinary and fundamental, most common and everyday _relation_ of bourgeois (commodity) society, a relation encountered billions of times, viz., the exchange of commodities. In this very simple phenomenon (in this “cell” of [bourgeois society](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/b/o.htm#bourgeois-society)) analysis reveals _all_ the contradictions (or the germs of _all_ contradictions) of modern society. The subsequent exposition shows us the development (_both_ growth _and_ movement) of these contradictions and of this society in the Σ[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#f2) of its individual parts. From its beginning to its end.

Such must also be the method of exposition (i.e., study) of dialectics in general (for with Marx the dialectics of bourgeois society is only a particular case of dialectics). To begin with what is the simplest, most ordinary, common, etc., with **any** _proposition:_ the leaves of a tree are green; John is a man: Fido is a dog, etc. Here already we have _dialectics_ (as Hegel’s genius recognised): the **individual** is the _universal_. (cf. Aristoteles, _Metaphisik,_ translation by Schegler, Bd. II, S. 40, 3. Buch, 4. Kapitel, 8-9: “denn natürlich kann man nicht der Meinung sin, daß es ein Haus (a house in general) gebe außer den sichtbaren Häusern,” “ού γρ άν ΰείημεν είναί τινα οίχίαν παρα τχς τινάς οίχίας”).[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#f3) Consequently, the opposites (the individual is opposed to the universal) are identical: the individual exists only in the connection that leads to the universal. The universal exists only in the individual and through the individual. Every individual is (in one way or another) a universal. Every universal is (a fragment, or an aspect, or the essence of) an individual. Every universal only approximately embraces all the individual objects. Every individual enters incompletely into the universal, etc., etc. Every individual is connected by thousands of transitions with other **kinds** of individuals (things, phenomena, processes) etc. _Here_ _already_ we have the elements, the germs, the concepts of _necessity,_ of objective connection in nature, etc. Here already we have the contingent and the necessary, the phenomenon and the essence; for when we say: John is a man, Fido is a dog, _this_ is a leaf of a tree, etc., we _disregard_ a number of attributes as _contingent_; we separate the essence from the appearance, and counterpose the one to the other.

Thus in any proposition we can (and must) disclose as in a “nucleus” (“cell”) the germs of _all_ the elements of dialectics, and thereby show that dialectics is a property of all human knowledge in general. And natural science shows us (and here again it must be demonstrated in _any_ simple instance) objective nature with the same qualities, the transformation of the individual into the universal, of the contingent into the necessary, transitions, modulations, and the reciprocal connection of opposites. Dialectics _is_ the theory of knowledge of (Hegel and) Marxism. This is the “aspect” of the matter (it is not “an aspect” but the _essence_ of the matter) to which Plekhanov, not to speak of other Marxists, paid no attention.

Knowledge is represented in the form of a series of circles both by Hegel (see [_Logic_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlconten.htm)) and by the modern “epistemologist” of natural science, the eclectic and foe of Hegelianism (which he did not understand!), Paul Volkmann (see his _Erkenntnistheorische Grundzüge,_[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#f4) S.)

|“Circles” in philosophy: **[**is a chronology of _persons_  <br>essential? No!**]**  <br>Ancient: from [Democritus](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/d/e.htm#democritus) to [Plato](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/p/l.htm#plato) and the dialectics  <br>of [Heraclitus](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#heraclitus).  <br>Renaissance: [Descartes](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/d/e.htm#descartes-rene) versus Gassendi ([Spinoza](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/s/p.htm#spinoza-benedicto)?)  <br>Modern:   [Holbach](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/o.htm#holbach)—[Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#gfw-hegel)   (via   [Berkeley](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/b/e.htm#berkeley-george),   [Hume](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/u.htm#hume-david),  <br>Kant). [Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#gfw-hegel)—[Feuerbach](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/e.htm#feuerbach-ludwig)—[Marx](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/m/a.htm#marx-karl)|

Dialectics as _living_, many-sided knowledge (with the number of sides eternally increasing), with an infinite number of shades of every approach and approximation to reality (with a philosophical system growing into a whole out of each shade)—here we have an immeasurably rich content as compared with “metaphysical” [materialism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#materialism), the fundamental _misfortune_ of which is its inability to apply dialectics to the Bildertheorie,[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#f5) to the process and development of knowledge.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Philosophical [idealism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/i/d.htm#idealism) is _only_ nonsense from the stand-  <br>point of crude, simple, metaphysical materialism. From  <br>the standpoint of _dialectical_ materialism, on the other  <br>hand, philosophical idealism is a _one-sided_, exaggerated,  <br>überschwengliches (Dietzgen)[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#f6) development (inflation,  <br>distension) of one of the features, aspects, facets of knowl-  <br>edge, into an absolute, _divorced_ from matter, from nature,||
|apotheosised. Idealism is clerical obscurantism. True. But  <br>philosophical idealism is (“_more correctly_” and  <br>“_in addition_”) a _road_ to clerical obscurantism  <br>_through_ _one of the shades_ of the infinitely com-  <br>plex _knowledge_ (dialectical) of man.|||NB  <br>this  <br> aphor-  <br>ism|

Human knowledge is not (or does not follow) a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve can be transformed (transformed one-sidedly) into an independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is _anchored_ by the class interests of the ruling classes). Rectilinearity and one-sidedness, woodenness and petrification, subjectivism and subjective blindness—voilà the epistemological roots of idealism. And clerical obscrutantism (= philosophical idealism), of course, has _epistemological_ roots, it is not groundless; it is a _sterile flower_ undoubtedly, but a sterile flower that grows on the living tree of living, fertile, genuine, powerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge.

Karl Marx 1845

# Theses On Feuerbach

---

Written: by Marx in Brussels in the spring of 1845, under the title “1) _ad_ Feuerbach”;  
Marx’s original text was first published in 1924, in German and in Russian translation, by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism in _Marx-Engels Archives,_ Book I, Moscow. The English translation was first published in the Lawrence and Wishart edition of _The German Ideology_  in 1938.  
The most widely known version of the _Theses_ is that based on Engels’ edited version, published as an appendix to his _Ludwig Feuerbach_ in 1888, where he gave it the title _Theses on Feuerbach_;  
Translated: by Cyril Smith 2002, based on work done jointly with Don Cuckson.

---

### 1

The main defect of all hitherto-existing materialism — that of Feuerbach included — is that the Object [_der Gegenstand_], actuality, sensuousness, are conceived only in the form of the object [_Objekts_], or of contemplation [_Anschauung_], but not as human sensuous activity, practice [_Praxis_], not subjectively. Hence it happened that the active side, in opposition to materialism, was developed by idealism — but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such. Feuerbach wants sensuous objects [_Objekte_], differentiated from thought-objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as objective [_gegenständliche_] activity. In _The Essence of Christianity_ [_Das Wesen des Christenthums_], he therefore regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice [_Praxis_] is conceived and defined only in its dirty-Jewish form of appearance [_Erscheinungsform_][[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm#jewish). Hence he does not grasp the significance of ‘revolutionary’, of ‘practical-critical’, activity.

### 2

The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a **practical** question. Man must prove the truth, _i.e._, the reality and power, the this-sidedness [_Diesseitigkeit_] of his thinking, in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.

### 3

The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [_Selbstveränderung_] can be conceived and rationally understood only as **revolutionary practice**.

### 4

Feuerbach starts off from the fact of religious self-estrangement [_Selbstentfremdung_], of the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world, and a secular [_weltliche_] one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done. For the fact that the secular basis lifts off from itself and establishes itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the inner strife and intrinsic contradictoriness of this secular basis. The latter must itself be understood in its contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised. Thus, for instance, once the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must itself be annihilated [_vernichtet_] theoretically and practically.

### 5

Feuerbach, not satisfied with **abstract thinking**, wants **sensuous contemplation** [_Anschauung_]; but he does not conceive sensuousness as **practical**, human-sensuous activity.

### 6

Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [_menschliche Wesen_ = ‘human nature’]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations. Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged:

1. To abstract from the historical process and to define the religious sentiment regarded by itself, and to presuppose an abstract — isolated - human individual.

2. The essence therefore can by him only be regarded as ‘species’, as an inner ‘dumb’ generality which unites many individuals only in a **natural** way.

### 7

Feuerbach consequently does not see that the ‘religious sentiment’ is itself a **social product**, and that the abstract individual that he analyses belongs in reality to a particular social form.

### 8

All social life is essentially **practical**. All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice.

### 9

The highest point reached by contemplative [_anschauende_] materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, is the contemplation of single individuals and of civil society [_bürgerlichen Gesellschaft_].

### 10

The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the standpoint of the new is human society or social humanity.

### 11

Philosophers have hitherto only _interpreted_ the world in various ways; the point is to _change_ it.

[Abstract]

[[....]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm)

Whilst the writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method, in this striking and [as far as concerns my own application of it] generous way, what else is he picturing but the dialectic method?

Of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyse its different forms of development, to trace out their inner connexion. Only after this work is done, can the actual movement be adequately described. If this is done successfully, if the life of the subject-matter is ideally reflected as in a mirror, then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction.

My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e., the process of thinking, which, under the name of “the Idea,” he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of “the Idea.” With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.

The mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic I criticised nearly thirty years ago, at a time when it was still the fashion. But just as I was working at the first volume of “Das Kapital,” it was the good pleasure of the peevish, arrogant, mediocre ‘Epigonoi who now talk large in cultured Germany, to treat Hegel in same way as the brave Moses Mendelssohn in Lessing’s time treated Spinoza, i.e., as a “dead dog.” I therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker, and even here and there, in the chapter on the theory of value, coquetted with the modes of expression peculiar to him. The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel’s hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.

In its mystified form, dialectic became the fashion in Germany, because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things. In its rational form it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.

The contradictions inherent in the movement of capitalist society impress themselves upon the practical bourgeois most strikingly in the changes of the periodic cycle, through which modern industry runs, and whose crowning point is the universal crisis. That crisis is once again approaching, although as yet but in its preliminary stage; and by the universality of its theatre and the intensity of its action it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the mushroom-upstarts of the new, holy Prusso-German empire.

> Preface of _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_
> 
> [...]  
> 
> The first work which I undertook to dispel the doubts assailing me was a critical re-examination of the Hegelian philosophy of law; the introduction to this work being published in the _Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher_ issued in Paris in 1844. My inquiry led me to the conclusion that neither legal relations nor political forms could be comprehended whether by themselves or on the basis of a so-called general development of the human mind, but that on the contrary they originate in the material conditions of life, the totality of which Hegel, following the example of English and French thinkers of the eighteenth century, embraces within the term "civil society"; that the anatomy of this civil society, however, has to be sought in political economy. The study of this, which I began in Paris, I continued in Brussels, where I moved owing to an expulsion order issued by M. Guizot. The general conclusion at which I arrived and which, once reached, became the guiding principle of my studies, can be summarised as follows. 
> 
> In the social [production](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#production) of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, [relations of production](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/e.htm#relations-production) which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material [productive forces](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#productive-forces). The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness.
> 
> The [mode of production](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production) of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the [consciousness](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm#consciousness) of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.
> 
> At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or — what is but a legal expression for the same thing — with the [property](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#property) relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters.
> 
> Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic — in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production.
> 
> No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself. Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found that the tasks itself arises only when the material conditions of its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation.
> 
> In broad outlines Asiatic[[A]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface-abs.htm#e1), ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production — antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonisms, but of one arising from the social conditions of life of the individuals; at the same time the productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism. This social formation brings, therefore, the prehistory of society to a close.
> 
> Frederick Engels, with whom I maintained a constant exchange of ideas by correspondence since the publication of his brilliant essay on the critique of economic categories (printed in the _Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher,_ arrived by another road (compare his _Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England_ ) at the same result as I, and when in the spring of 1845 he too came to live in Brussels, we decided to set forth together our conception as opposed to the ideological one of German philosophy, in fact to settle accounts with our former philosophical conscience. The intention was carried out in the form of a critique of post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript [The German Ideology], two large octavo volumes, had long ago reached the publishers in Westphalia when we were informed that owing to changed circumstances it could not be printed. We abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice all the more willingly since we had achieved our main purpose — self-clarification....

> [A.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface-abs.htm#eb1) As a second footnote to the Communist Manifesto, Engels wrote in 1888:
> 
> In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, [was] all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organization of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in [The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm), second edition, Stuttgart, 1886.
> 
> Thus, as the science of understanding pre-history progressed (pre-history being that time before written records of human civilization exist), Marx & Engels changed their understanding and descriptions accordingly. In the above text, Marx mentions “Asiatic” modes of production. At the time, they had thought Asian civilization was the first we could speak of humanity (an understanding based on Hegel, see: [The Oriental Realm](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR341)). After writing [_The Grundrisse_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch09.htm), they dropped the idea of a distinct Asiatic mode of production, and kept four basic forms: tribal, ancient, feudal, and capitalist.

Karl Marx: Critique of Political Economy  
Review by Frederick Engels

#### Karl Marx, “A Contribution to the Critique of Political economy”  
[Abstract]

[[....]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/appx2.htm)

After the defeat of the Revolution of 1848-49, at a time when it became increasingly impossible to exert any influence on Germany from abroad, our party relinquished the field of emigrant squabbles — for that was the only feasible action left — to the vulgar democrats. While these were chasing about to their heart's content, scuffling today, fraternising tomorrow and the day after once more washing their dirty linen in public, while they went begging throughout America and immediately afterwards started another row over the division of the few coins they had collected — our party was glad to find once more some quiet time for research work. It had the great advantage that its theoretical foundation was a new scientific conception the elaboration of which provided adequate work; even for this reason alone it could never become so demoralised as the "great men" of the emigration.

The book under consideration is the first result of these studies.

### II

[_Das Volk_, No. 16, August 20,1859]

The purpose of a work like the one under review cannot simply be desultory criticism of separate sections of political economy or the discussion of one or another economic issue in isolation. On the contrary, it is from the beginning designed to give a systematic _résumé_ of the whole complex of political economy and a coherent elaboration of the laws governing bourgeois production and bourgeois exchange. This elaboration is at the same time a comprehensive critique of economic literature, for economists are nothing but interpreters of and apologists for these laws.

Hardly any attempt has been made since Hegel's death to set forth any branch of science in its specific inner coherence. The official Hegelian school had assimilated only the most simple devices of the master's dialectics and applied them to everything and anything, often moreover with ridiculous incompetence. Hegel's whole heritage was, so far as they were concerned, confined exclusively to a template, by means of which any subject could be knocked into shape, and a set of words and phrases whose only remaining purpose was to turn up conveniently whenever they experienced a lack of ideas and of concrete knowledge. Thus it happened, as a professor at Bonn has said, that these Hegelians knew nothing but could write about everything. The results were, of course, accordingly. For all their conceit these gentlemen were, however, sufficiently conscious of their failings to avoid major problems as far as possible. The superannuated fossilised type of learning held its ground because of its superior factual knowledge, and after Feuerbach's renunciation of the speculative method, Hegelianism gradually died away, and it seemed that science was once more dominated by antiquated metaphysics with its rigid categories.

For this there were quite natural reasons. The rule of the Hegelian Diadochi, which ended in empty phrases, was naturally followed by a period in which the concrete content of science predominated once more over the formal aspect. Moreover, Germany at the same time applied itself with quite extraordinary energy to the natural sciences, in accordance with the immense bourgeois development setting in after 1848; with the coming into fashion of these sciences, in which the speculative trend had never achieved any real importance, the old metaphysical mode of thinking, even down to the extreme triviality of Wolff, gained ground rapidly. Hegel was forgotten and a new materialism arose in the natural sciences; it differed in principle very little from the materialism of the eighteenth century and its main advantage was merely a greater stock of data relating to the natural sciences, especially chemistry and physiology. The narrow-minded mode of thinking of the pre-Kantian period in its most banal form is reproduced by Büchner and Vogt, and even Moleschott, who swears by Feuerbach, frequently flounders in a highly diverting manner through the most simple categories. The jaded cart-horse of the commonplace bourgeois mind falters of course in confusion in front of the ditch separating substance from appearance, and cause from effect; but one should not ride carthorses if one intends to go. coursing over the very rough ground of abstract reasoning.

In this context, therefore, a question had to be solved which was not connected with political economy as such. Which scientific method should be used? There was, on the one hand, the Hegelian dialectics in the quite abstract "speculative" form in which Hegel had left it, and on the other hand the ordinary, mainly Wolffian, metaphysical method, which had come again into vogue, and which was also employed by the bourgeois economists to write their bulky rambling volumes. The second method had been theoretically demolished by Kant and particularly by Hegel so that its continued use in practice could only be rendered possible by inertia and the absence of an alternative simple method. The Hegelian method, on the other hand, was in its existing form quite inapplicable. It was essentially idealist and the main point in this case was the elaboration of a world outlook that was more materialist than any previous one. Hegel's method took as its point of departure pure thought, whereas here the starting point was to be inexorable facts. A method which, according to its own avowal, "came from nothing through nothing to nothing" was in this shape by no means suitable. It was, nevertheless, the only element in the entire available logical material which could at least serve as a point of origin. It had not been subjected to criticism, not been overthrown; none of the opponents of the great dialectician had been able to make a breach in the proud edifice. It had been forgotten because the Hegelian school did not know how to apply it. Hence, it was first of all essential to carry through a thorough critique of the Hegelian method.

It was the exceptional historical sense underlying Hegel's manner of reasoning which distinguished it from that of all other philosophers. However abstract and idealist the form employed, yet his evolution of ideas runs always parallel with the evolution of universal history, and the latter was indeed supposed to be only the proof of the former. Although this reversed the actual relation and stood it on its head, yet the real content was invariably incorporated in his philosophy, especially since Hegel — unlike his followers — did not rely on ignorance, but was one of the most erudite thinkers of all time. He was the first to try to demonstrate that there is an evolution, an intrinsic coherence in history, and however strange some things in his philosophy of history may seem to us now, the grandeur of the basic conception is still admirable today, compared both with his predecessors and with those who following him ventured to advance general historical observations. This monumental conception of history pervades the _Phänomenologies, Asthetik and Geschichte der Philosophie,_ and the material is everywhere set forth historically, in a definite historical context, even if in an abstract distorted manner.

This epoch-making conception of history was a direct theoretical pre-condition of the new materialist outlook, and already this constituted a connecting link with the logical method as well. Since, even from the standpoint of "pure reasoning", this forgotten dialectics had led to such results, and had moreover with the greatest ease coped with the whole of the former logic and metaphysics, it must at all events comprise more than sophistry and hairsplitting. But the critique of this method, which the entire official philosophy had evaded and still evades, was no small matter.

Marx was and is the only one who could undertake the work of extracting from the Hegelian logic the nucleus containing Hegel's real discoveries in this field, and of establishing the dialectical method, divested of its idealist wrappings, in the simple form in which it becomes the only correct mode of conceptual evolution. The working out of the method which underlies Marx's critique of political economy is, we think, a result hardly less significant than the basic materialist conception.

Even after the determination of the method, the critique of economics could still be arranged in two ways — historically or logically. Since in the course of history, as in its literary reflection, the evolution proceeds by and large from the simplest to the more complex relations, the historical development of political economy constituted a natural clue, which the critique could take as a point of departure, and then the economic categories would appear on the whole in the same order as in the logical exposition. This form seems to have the advantage of greater lucidity, for it traces the actual development, but in fact it would thus become, at most, more popular. History moves often in leaps and bounds and in a zigzag line, and as this would have to be followed throughout, it would mean not only that a considerable amount of material of slight importance would have to be included, but also that the train of thought would frequently have to be interrupted; it would, moreover, be impossible to write the history of economy without that of bourgeois society, and the task would thus become immense, because of the absence of all preliminary studies. The logical method of approach was therefore the only suitable one. This, however, is indeed nothing but the historical method, only stripped of the historical form and diverting chance occurrences. The point where this history begins must also be the starting point of the train of thought, and its further progress will be simply the reflection, in abstract and theoretically consistent form, of the historical course. Though the reflection is corrected, it is corrected in accordance with laws provided by the actual historical course, since each factor can be examined at the stage of development where it reaches its full maturity, its classical form.

With this method we begin with the first and simplest relation which is historically, actually available, thus in this context with the first economic relation to be found. We analyse this relation. The fact that it is a _relation_ already implies that it has two aspects which are _related to each other._ Each of these aspects is examined separately; this reveals the nature of their mutual behaviour, their reciprocal action. Contradictions will emerge demanding a solution. But since we are not examining an abstract mental process that takes place solely in our mind, but an actual event which really took place at some time or other, or which is still taking place, these contradictions will have arisen in practice and have probably been solved. We shall trace the mode of this solution and find that it has been effected by establishing a new relation, whose two contradictory aspects we shall then have to set forth, and so on.

Political economy begins with _commodities_, with the moment when products are exchanged, either by individuals or by primitive communities. The product being exchanged is a commodity. But it is a commodity merely by virtue of the _thing_, the product being linked with a _relation_ between two persons or communities, the relation between producer and consumer, who at this stage are no longer united in the same person. Here is at once an example of a peculiar fact, which pervades the whole economy and has produced serious confusion in the minds of bourgeois economists — economics is not concerned with things but with relations between persons, and in the final analysis between classes; these relations however are always _bound to things_ and _appear as things_. Although a few economists had an inkling of this connection in isolated instances, Marx was the first to reveal its significance for the entire economy thus making the most difficult problems so simple and clear that even bourgeois economists will now be able to grasp them.

If we examine the various aspects of the commodity, that is of the fully evolved commodity and not as it at first slowly emerges in the spontaneous barter of two primitive communities, it presents itself to us from two angles, that of use-value and of exchange-value, and thus we come immediately to the province of economic debate. Anyone wishing to find a striking instance of the fact that the German dialectic method at its present stage of development is at least as superior to the old superficially glib metaphysical method as railways are to the mediaeval means of transport, should look up Adam Smith or any other authoritative economist of repute to see how much distress exchange-value and use-value caused these gentlemen, the difficulty they had in distinguishing the two properly and in expressing the determinate form peculiar to each, and then compare the clear, simple exposition given by Marx.

After use-value and exchange-value have been expounded, the commodity as a direct unity of the two is described as it enters the _exchange process_. The contradictions arising here may be found on pp. 20 and 21. We merely note that these contradictions are not only of interest for theoretical, abstract reasons, but that they also reflect the difficulties originating from the nature of direct interchange, i.e., simple barter, and the impossibilities inevitably confronting this first crude form of exchange. The solution of these impossibilities is achieved by investing a specific commodity — _money_ — with the attribute of representing the exchange-value of all other commodities. Money or simple circulation is then analysed in the second chapter, namely (1) money as a measure of value, and, at the same time, value measured in terms of money, i.e., _price_, is more closely defined; (2) money as _means of circulation_ and (3) the unity of the two aspects, _real money_ which represents bourgeois material wealth as a whole. This concludes the first part, the conversion of money into capital is left for the second part.

One can see that with this method, the logical exposition need by no means be confined to the purely abstract sphere. On the contrary, it requires historical illustration and continuous contact with reality. A great variety of such evidence is therefore inserted, comprising references both to different stages in the actual historical course of social development and to economic works, in which the working out of lucid definitions of economic relations is traced from the outset. The critique of particular, more or less one-sided or confused interpretations is thus substantially given already in the logical exposition and can be kept quite short.

The economic content of the book will be discussed in a third article.

Karl Marx's Outline of the Critique of Political Economy (_Grundrisse_)

### 1. Production, Consumption, Distribution, Exchange (Circulation)  
[Abstract]

---

[[....]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm)

## (3) The Method of Political Economy

When we consider a given country politico-economically, we begin with its population, its distribution among classes, town, country, the coast, the different branches of production, export and import, annual production and consumption, commodity prices etc.

It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed. These classes in turn are an empty phrase if I am not familiar with the elements on which they rest. E.g. wage labour, capital, etc. These latter in turn presuppose exchange, division of labour, prices, etc. For example, capital is nothing without wage labour, without value, money, price etc. Thus, if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception [_Vorstellung_] of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple concepts [_Begriff_], from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations. The former is the path historically followed by economics at the time of its origins. The economists of the seventeenth century, e.g., always begin with the living whole, with population, nation, state, several states, etc.; but they always conclude by discovering through analysis a small number of determinant, abstract, general relations such as division of labour, money, value, etc. As soon as these individual moments had been more or less firmly established and abstracted, there began the economic systems, which ascended from the simple relations, such as labour, division of labour, need, exchange value, to the level of the state, exchange between nations and the world market. The latter is obviously the scientifically correct method. The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation [_Anschauung_] and conception. Along the first path the full conception was evaporated to yield an abstract determination; along the second, the abstract determinations lead towards a reproduction of the concrete by way of thought. In this way Hegel fell into the illusion of conceiving the real as the product of thought concentrating itself, probing its own depths, and unfolding itself out of itself, by itself, whereas the method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is only the way in which thought appropriates the concrete, reproduces it as the concrete in the mind. But this is by no means the process by which the concrete itself comes into being. For example, the simplest economic category, say e.g. exchange value, presupposes population, moreover a population producing in specific relations; as well as a certain kind of family, or commune, or state, etc. It can never exist other than as an abstract, one-sided relation within an already given, concrete, living whole. As a category, by contrast, exchange value leads an antediluvian existence. Therefore, to the kind of consciousness—and this is characteristic of the philosophical consciousness—for which conceptual thinking is the real human being, and for which the conceptual world as such is thus the only reality, the movement of the categories appears as the real act of production—which only, unfortunately, receives a jolt from the outside—whose product is the world; and—but this is again a tautology—this is correct in so far as the concrete totality is a totality of thoughts, concrete in thought, in fact a product of thinking and comprehending; but not in any way a product of the concept which thinks and generates itself outside or above observation and conception; a product, rather, of the working-up of observation and conception into concepts. The totality as it appears in the head, as a totality of thoughts, is a product of a thinking head, which appropriates the world in the only way it can, a way different from the artistic, religious, practical and mental appropriation of this world. The real subject retains its autonomous existence outside the head just as before; namely as long as the head's conduct is merely speculative, merely theoretical. Hence, in the theoretical method, too, the subject, society, must always be kept in mind as the presupposition.

But do not these simpler categories also have an independent historical or natural existence predating the more concrete ones? That depends. Hegel, for example, correctly begins the Philosophy of Right with possession, this being the subject's simplest juridical relation. But there is no possession preceding the family or master—servant relations, which are far more concrete relations. However, it would be correct to say that there are families or clan groups which still merely _possess,_ but have no _property._ The simple category therefore appears in relation to property as a relation of simple families or clan groups. In the higher society it appears as the simpler relation of a developed organization. But the concrete substratum of which possession is a relation is always presupposed. One can imagine an individual savage as possessing something. But in that case possession is not a juridical relation. It is incorrect that possession develops historically into the family. Possession, rather, always presupposes this 'more concrete juridical category'. There would still always remain this much, however, namely that the simple categories are the expressions of relations within which the less developed concrete may have already realized itself before having posited the more many-sided connection or relation which is mentally expressed in the more concrete category; while the more developed concrete preserves the same category as a subordinate relation. Money may exist, and did exist historically, before capital existed, before banks existed, before wage labour existed, etc. Thus in this respect it may be said that the simpler category can express the dominant relations of a less developed whole, or else those subordinate relations of a more developed whole which already had a historic existence before this whole developed in the direction expressed by a more concrete category. To that extent the path of abstract thought, rising from the simple to the combined, would correspond to the real historical process.

It may be said on the other hand that there are very developed but nevertheless historically less mature forms of society, in which the highest forms of economy, e.g. cooperation, a developed division of labour, etc., are found, even though there is no kind of money, e.g. Peru. Among the Slav communities also, money and the exchange which determines it play little or no role within the individual communities, but only on their boundaries, in traffic with others; it is simply wrong to place exchange at the center of communal society as the original, constituent element. It originally appears, rather, in the connection of the different communities with one another, not in the relations between the different members of a single community. Further, although money everywhere plays a role from very early on, it is nevertheless a predominant element, in antiquity, only within the confines of certain one-sidedly developed nations, trading nations. And even in the most advanced parts of the ancient world, among the Greeks and Romans, the full development of money, which is presupposed in modern bourgeois society, appears only in the period of their dissolution. This very simple category, then, makes a historic appearance in its full intensity only in the most developed conditions of society. By no means does it wade its way through all economic relations. For example, in the Roman Empire, at its highest point of development, the foundation remained taxes and payments in kind. The money system actually completely developed there only in the army. And it never took over the whole of labour. Thus, although the simpler category may have existed historically before the more concrete, it can achieve its full (intensive and extensive) development precisely in a combined form of society, while the more concrete category was more fully developed in a less developed form of society.

Labour seems a quite simple category. The conception of labour in this general form—as labour as such—is also immeasurably old. Nevertheless, when it is economically conceived in this simplicity, 'labour' is as modern a category as are the relations which create this simple abstraction. The Monetary System [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/intro-f.htm#19) for example, still locates wealth altogether objectively, as an external thing, in money. Compared with this standpoint, the commercial, or manufacture, system took a great step forward by locating the source of wealth not in the object but in a subjective activity—in commercial and manufacturing activity—even though it still always conceives this activity within narrow boundaries, as moneymaking. In contrast to this system, that of the Physiocrats posits a certain kind of labour—agriculture—as the creator of wealth, and the object itself no longer appears in a monetary disguise, but as the product in general, as the general result of labour. This product, as befits the narrowness of the activity, still always remains a naturally determined product—the product of agriculture, the product of the earth _par excellence._

It was an immense step forward for Adam Smith to throw out every limiting specification of wealth-creating activity—not only manufacturing, or commercial or agricultural labour, but one as well as the others, labour in general. With the abstract universality of wealth-creating activity we now have the universality of the object defined as wealth, the product as such or again labour as such, but labour as past, objectified labour. How difficult and great was this transition may be seen from how Adam Smith himself from time to time still falls back into the Physiocratic system. Now, it might seem that all that had been achieved thereby was to discover the abstract expression for the simplest and most ancient relation in which human beings—in whatever form of society—play the role of producers. This is correct in one respect. Not in another. Indifference towards any specific kind of labour presupposes a very developed totality of real kinds of labour, of which no single one is any longer predominant. As a rule, the most general abstractions arise only in the midst of the richest possible concrete development, where one thing appears as common to many, to all. Then it ceases to be thinkable in a particular form alone. On the other side, this abstraction of labour as such is not merely the mental product of a concrete totality of labours. Indifference towards specific labours corresponds to a form of society in which individuals can with ease transfer from one labour to another, and where the specific kind is a matter of chance for them, hence of indifference. Not only the category, labour, but labour in reality has here become the means of creating wealth in general, and has ceased to be organically linked with particular individuals in any specific form. Such a state of affairs is at its most developed in the most modern form of existence of bourgeois society—in the United States. Here, then, for the first time, the point of departure of modern economics, namely the abstraction of the category 'labour', 'labour as such', labour pure and simple, becomes true in practice. The simplest abstraction, then, which modern economics places at the head of its discussions, and which expresses an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms of society, nevertheless achieves practical truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most modern society. One could say that this indifference towards particular kinds of labour, which is a historic product in the United States, appears e.g. among the Russians as a spontaneous inclination. But there is a devil of a difference between barbarians who are fit by nature to be used for anything, and civilized people who apply themselves to everything. And then in practice the Russian indifference to the specific character of labour corresponds to being embedded by tradition within a very specific kind of labour, from which only external influences can jar them loose.

This example of labour shows strikingly how even the most abstract categories, despite their validity—precisely because of their abstractness—for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific character of this abstraction, themselves likewise a product of historic relations, and possess their full validity only for and within these relations.

Bourgeois society is the most developed and the most complex historic organization of production. The categories which express its relations, the comprehension of its structure, thereby also allows insights into the structure and the relations of production of all the vanished social formations out of whose ruins and elements it built itself up, whose partly still unconquered remnants are carried along within it, whose mere nuances have developed explicit significance within it, etc. Human anatomy contains a key to the anatomy of the ape. The intimations of higher development among the subordinate animal species, however, can be understood only after the higher development is already known. The bourgeois economy thus supplies the key to the ancient, etc. But not at all in the manner of those economists who smudge over _all_ historical differences and see bourgeois relations in all forms of society. One can understand tribute, tithe, etc., if one is acquainted with ground rent. But one must not identify them. Further, since bourgeois society is itself only a contradictory form of development, relations derived from earlier forms will often be found within it only in an entirely stunted form, or even travestied. For example, communal property. Although it is true, therefore, that the categories of bourgeois economics possess a truth for all other forms of society, this is to be taken only with a grain of salt. They can contain them in a developed, or stunted, or caricatured form etc., but always with an essential difference. The so-called historical presentation of development is founded, as a rule, on the fact that the latest form regards the previous ones as steps leading up to itself, and, since it is only rarely and only under quite specific conditions able to criticize itself—leaving aside, of course, the historical periods which appear to themselves as times of decadence—it always conceives them one-sidedly. The Christian religion was able to be of assistance in reaching an objective understanding of earlier mythologies only when its own self-criticism had been accomplished to a certain degree, so to speak. Likewise, bourgeois economics arrived at an understanding of feudal, ancient, oriental economics only after the self-criticism of bourgeois society had begun. In so far as the bourgeois economy did not mythologically identify itself altogether with the past, its critique of the previous economies, notably of feudalism, with which it was still engaged in direct struggle, resembled the critique which Christianity leveled against paganism, or also that of Protestantism against Catholicism.

In the succession of the economic categories, as in any other historical, social science, it must not be forgotten that their subject—here, modern bourgeois society—is always what is given, in the head as well as in reality, and that these categories therefore express the forms of being, the characteristics of existence, and often only individual sides of this specific society, this subject, and that therefore this society by no means begins only at the point where one can speak of it _as such;_ this holds _for science as well._ This is to be kept in mind because it will shortly be decisive for the order and sequence of the categories. For example, nothing seems more natural than to begin with ground rent, with landed property, since this is bound up with the earth, the source of all production and of all being, and with the first form of production of all more or less settled societies—agriculture. But nothing would be more erroneous. In all forms of society there is one specific kind of production which predominates over the rest, whose relations thus assign rank and influence to the others. It is a general illumination which bathes all the other colours and modifies their particularity. It is a particular ether which determines the specific gravity of every being which has materialized within it. For example, with pastoral peoples (mere hunting and fishing peoples lie outside the point where real development begins). Certain forms of tillage occur among them, sporadic ones. Landed property is determined by this. It is held in common, and retains this form to a greater or lesser degree according to the greater or lesser degree of attachment displayed by these peoples to their tradition, e.g. the communal property of the Slavs. Among peoples with a settled agriculture—this settling already a great step—where this predominates, as in antiquity and in the feudal order, even industry, together with its organization and the forms of property corresponding to it, has a more or less landed-proprietary character; is either completely dependent on it, as among the earlier Romans, or, as in the Middle Ages, imitates, within the city and its relations, the organization of the land. In the Middle Ages, capital itself—apart from pure money-capital—in the form of the traditional artisans' tools etc., has this landed-proprietary character. In bourgeois society it is the opposite. Agriculture more and more becomes merely a branch of industry, and is entirely dominated by capital. Ground rent likewise. In all forms where landed property rules, the natural relation still predominant. In those where capital rules, the social, historically created element. Ground rent cannot be understood without capital. But capital can certainly be understood without ground rent. Capital is the all-dominating economic power of bourgeois society. It must form the starting-point as well as the finishing-point, and must be dealt with before landed property. After both have been examined in particular, their interrelation must be examined.

It would therefore be unfeasible and wrong to let the economic categories follow one another in the same sequence as that in which they were historically decisive. Their sequence is determined, rather, by their relation to one another in modern bourgeois society, which is precisely the opposite of that which seems to be their natural order or which corresponds to historical development. The point is not the historic position of the economic relations in the succession of different forms of society. Even less is it their sequence 'in the idea' (Proudhon) [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/intro-f.htm#21) (a muddy notion of historic movement). Rather, their order within modern bourgeois society.

The purity (abstract specificity) in which the trading peoples—Phoenicians, Carthaginians—appear in the old world is determined precisely by the predominance of the agricultural peoples. Capital, as trading-capital or as money-capital, appears in this abstraction precisely where capital is not yet the predominant element of societies. Lombards, Jews take up the same position towards the agricultural societies of the Middle Ages.

As a further example of the divergent positions which the same category can occupy in different social stages: one of the latest forms of bourgeois society, _joint-stock companies._ These also appear, however, at its beginning, in the great, privileged monopoly trading companies.

The concept of national wealth creeps into the work of the economists of the seventeenth century—continuing partly with those of the eighteenth—in the form of the notion that wealth is created only to enrich the state, and that its power is proportionate to this wealth. This was the still unconsciously hypocritical form in which wealth and the production of wealth proclaimed themselves as the purpose of modern states, and regarded these states henceforth only as means for the production of wealth.

The order obviously has to be (1) the general, abstract determinants which obtain in more or less all forms of society, but in the above-explained sense. (2) The categories which make up the inner structure of bourgeois society and on which the fundamental classes rest. Capital, wage labour, landed property. Their interrelation. Town and country. The three great social classes. Exchange between them. Circulation. Credit system (private). (3) Concentration of bourgeois society in the form of the state. Viewed in relation to itself. The 'unproductive' classes. Taxes. State debt. Public credit. The population. The colonies. Emigration. (4) The international relation of production. International division of labour. International exchange. Export and import. Rate of exchange. (5) The world market and crises.

#### 2) The Mystery of Speculative Construction

The mystery of the Critical presentation of the _Mystéres de Paris_ is the mystery of _speculative_, of _Hegelian construction_. Once Herr Szeliga has proclaimed that "degeneracy within civilisation" and rightlessness in the state are "mysteries", i.e., has dissolved them in the category "_mystery_", he lets "mystery" begin its _speculative career_. A few words will suffice to characterise speculative construction _in general_. Herr Szeliga's treatment of the _Mystéres de Paris_ will give the application in _detail_.

If from real apples, pears, strawberries and almonds I form the general idea "_Fruit_”, if I go further and _imagine_ that my abstract idea "_Fruit_”, derived from real fruit, is an entity existing outside me, is indeed the true essence of the pear, the apple, etc., then in the _language of speculative_ philosophy — I am declaring that "_Fruit_” is the "_Substance_” of the pear, the apple, the almond, etc. I am saying, therefore, that to be a pear is not essential to the pear, that to be an apple is not essential to the apple; that what is essential to these things is not their real existence, perceptible to the senses, but the essence that I have abstracted from them and then foisted on them, the essence of my idea — "_Fruit_”. I therefore declare apples, pears, almonds, etc., to be mere forms of existence, _modi_, of "_Fruit_” My finite understanding supported by my senses does of course _distinguish_ an apple from a pear and a pear from an almond, but my speculative reason declares these sensuous differences inessential and irrelevant. It sees in the apple _the same_ as in the pear, and in the pear the same as in the almond, namely "_Fruit_”. Particular real fruits are no more than semblances whose true essence is "_the_ substance" — "_Fruit_”.

By this method one attains no particular _wealth of definition_. The mineralogist whose whole science was limited to the statement that all minerals are really "_the_ Mineral" would be a mineralogist only in _his imagination_. For every mineral the speculative mineralogist Says "the Mineral", and his science is reduced to repeating this word as many times as there are real minerals.

Having reduced the different real fruits to the _one_ "fruit" of abstraction — "_the_ Fruit", speculation must, in order to attain some semblance of real content, try somehow to find its way back from "_the_ Fruit", from the _Substance_ to the _diverse_, ordinary real fruits, the pear, the apple, the almond, etc. It is as hard to produce real fruits from the abstract idea "_the_ Fruit" as it is easy to produce this abstract idea from real fruits. Indeed, it is impossible to arrive at the opposite of an abstraction without relinquishing the abstraction.

The speculative philosopher therefore relinquishes the abstraction "_the_ Fruit", but in a _speculative, mystical_ fashion — with the appearance of _not_ relinquishing it. Thus it is really only in appearance that he rises above his abstraction. He argues somewhat as follows:

If apples, pears, almonds and strawberries are really nothing but "_the_ Substance", "_the_ Fruit", the question arises: Why does "_the_ Fruit" manifest itself to me sometimes as an apple, sometimes as a pear, sometimes as an almond? Why this _semblance of diversity_ which so obviously contradicts my speculative conception of _Unity_, "_the_ Substance", "_the_ Fruit"?

This, answers the speculative philosopher, is because "_the_ Fruit" is not dead, undifferentiated, motionless, but a living, self-differentiating, moving essence. The diversity of the ordinary fruits is significant not only for my sensuous understanding, but also for "_the_ Fruit" itself and for speculative reason. The different ordinary fruits are different manifestations of the life of the "one Fruit"; they are crystallisations of "_the_ Fruit" itself. Thus in the apple "_the_ Fruit" gives itself an apple-like existence, in the pear a pear-like existence. We must therefore no longer say, as one might from the standpoint of the Substance: a pear is "_the_ Fruit", an apple is "_the_ Fruit", an almond is "_the_ Fruit", but rather "_the_ Fruit" presents itself as a pear, "_the_ Fruit" presents itself as an apple, "_the_ Fruit" presents itself as an almond; and the differences which distinguish apples, pears and almonds from one another are the self-differentiations of "_the_ Fruit" and,.make the particular fiuits different members of the life-process of "_the_ Fruit". Thus "_the_ Fruit" is no longer an empty undifferentiated unity; it is oneness as _allness,_ as "_totality_” of fruits, which constitute an "_organically linked series of members_”. In every member of that series "_the_ Fruit" gives itself a more developed, more explicit existence, until finally, as the "_summary_” of all fruits, it is at the same time the living _unity_ which contains all those fruits dissolved in itself just as it produces them from within itself, just as, for instance, all the limbs of the body are constantly dissolved in and constantly produced out of the blood.

We see that if the Christian religion knows only _one_ Incarnation of God, speculative philosophy has as many incarnations as there are things, just as it has here in every fruit an incarnation of the Substance, of the Absolute Fruit. The main interest for the speculative philosopher is therefore to produce the _existence_ of the real ordinary fruits and to say in some mysterious way that there are apples, pears, almonds and raisins. But the apples, pears, almonds and raisins that we rediscover in the speculative world are nothing but _semblances_ of apples, _semblances_ of pears, _semblances_ of almonds and _semblances_ of raisins, for they are moments in the life of "_the_ Fruit", this abstract creation of the mind, and therefore themselves abstract _creations of the mind_. Hence what is delightful in this speculation is to rediscover all the real fruits there, but as fruits which have a higher mystical significance, which have grown out of the ether of your brain and not out of the material earth, which are incarnations of "_the_ Fruit", of the _Absolute Subject_. When you return from the abstraction, the _supernatural_ creation of the mind, "_the_ Fruit", to real _natural_ fruits, you give on the contrary the natural fruits a supernatural significance and transform them into sheer abstractions. Your main interest is then to point out the _unity_ of "_the_ Fruit" in all the manifestations of its life — the apple, the pear, the almond — that is, to show the _mystical interconnection_ between these fruits, how in each one of them "_the_ Fruit" realises itself by _degrees_ and _necessarily_ progresses, for instance, from its existence as a raisin to its existence as an almond. Hence the value of the ordinary fruits _no longer_ consists in their _natural_ qualities, _but_ in their _speculative_ quality, which gives each of them a definite place in the life-process of "_the_ Absolute Fruit"

The ordinary man does not think he is saying anything extraordinary when he states that there are apples and pears. But when the philosopher expresses their existence in the speculative way he says something _extraordinary_. He performs a _miracle_ by producing the real _natural objects_, the apple, the pear, etc., out of the unreal _creation of the mind_ "_the_ Fruit", i.e., by _creating_ those fruits out of his _own abstract reason_, which he considers as an Absolute Subject outside himself, represented here as "_the_ Fruit". And in regard to every object the existence of which he expresses, he accomplishes an act of creation.

It goes without saying that the speculative philosopher accomplishes this continuous creation only by presenting universally known qualities of the apple, the pear, etc., which exist in reality, as determining features _invented_ by him, by giving the _names_ of the real things to what abstract reason alone can create, to abstract formulas of reason, finally, by declaring his _own_ activity, by which _he passes_ from the idea of an apple to the idea of a pear, to be the _self-activity_ of the Absolute Subject, "the Fruit"

In the speculative way of speaking, this operation is called comprehending _Substance as Subject_, as an _inner process_, as an _Absolute Person,_ and this comprehension constitutes the essential character of _Hegel's_ method.

These preliminary remarks were necessary to make Herr Szeliga intelligible. Only now, after dissolving real relations, e.g., law and civilisation, in the category of mystery and thereby making "_Mystery_”(das Geheimnis) into Substance, does he rise to the true speculative, _Hegelian_ height and transforms "_Mystery_” into a self-existing Subject _incarnating_ itself in real situations and persons so that the manifestations of its life are countesses, marquises, grisettes, porters, notaries, charlatans, and love intrigues, balls, wooden doors, etc. Having produced the category "_Mystery_” out of the real world, he produces the real world out of this category.

#### Chapter 6, Part 3 (D): Critical Battle Against French Materialism  
[Abstract]

---

“_Spinozism_ dominated the eighteenth century both in its later French variety, which made matter into substance, and in deism, which conferred on matter a more spiritual name.... _Spinoza’s French school_ and the supporters of deism were but two sects disputing over the true meaning of _his system_.... The simple fate of this Enlightenment was its decline in _romanticism_ after being obliged to surrender to the reaction which began after the French movement.”

That is what _Criticism_ says.

To the Critical history of French materialism we shall oppose a brief outline of its ordinary, mass-type history. We shall acknowledge with due respect the abyss between history as it really happened and history as it takes place according to the decree of “_Absolute Criticism_”, the creator equally of the old and of the new. And finally, obeying the prescriptions of _Criticism_, we shall make the “Why?”, “Whence?” and “Whither?” of Critical history the “object of a persevering study”.

“Speaking _exactly_ and in the _prosaic sense_”, the French Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, and in particular _French materialism_, was not only a struggle against the existing political institutions and the existing religion and theology; it was just as much an _open, clearly expressed_ struggle against the _metaphysics of the seventeenth century_, and against all _metaphysics_, in particular that of _Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza_ and _Leibniz_. _Philosophy_ was counterposed to _metaphysics_, just as _Feuerbach_, in his first resolute attack on _Hegel_, counterposed _sober philosophy_ to _wild speculation_. Seventeenth century _metaphysics_, driven from the field by the _French Enlightenment_, notably, by French materialism of the eighteenth century, experienced a _victorious and substantial restoration_ in _German philosophy_, particularly in _the speculative German philosophy_ of the nineteenth century. After _Hegel_ linked it in a masterly fashion with all subsequent metaphysics and with German idealism and founded a metaphysical universal kingdom, the attack on theology again corresponded, as in the eighteenth century, to an attack on _speculative metaphysics_ and _metaphysics in general_. It will be defeated for ever by _materialism_, which has now been perfected by the work of _speculation_ itself and coincides with _humanism_. But just as _Feuerbach_ is the representative of _materialism_ coinciding with _humanism_ in the _theoretical_ domain, French and English _socialism_ and _communism_ represent materialism coinciding with _humanism_ in the _practical_ domain.

“Speaking _exactly_ and in the _prosaic sense_”, there are _two trends_ in _French materialism_; one traces its origin to _Descartes,_ the other to _Locke._ The latter is _mainly_ a _French_ development and leads directly to _socialism_. The former, _mechanical_ materialism, merges with French _natural science_ proper. The two trends intersect in the course of development. We have no need here to go more deeply into the French materialism that derives directly from _Descartes,_ any more than into the French school of _Newton_ and the development of French natural science in general.

We shall therefore merely say the following:

_Descartes_ in his _physics_ endowed _matter_ with self-creative power and conceived _mechanical_ motion as the manifestation of its life. He completely separated his _physics_ from his _metaphysics_. _Within_ his physics, _matter_ is the sole _substance_, the sole basis of being and of knowledge.

_Mechanical_ French materialism adopted _Descartes’ physics_ in opposition to his metaphysics. His followers were by profession _anti-metaphysicians_, i.e., _physicists_.

This school begins with the _physician Le Roy,_ reaches its zenith with the physician _Cabanis_, and the physician _La Mettrie_ is its centre. Descartes was still living when Le Roy, like _La Mettrie_ in the eighteenth century, transposed the Cartesian structure of the animal to the human soul and declared that the soul is a _modus of the body_ and _ideas_ are _mechanical motions_. Le Roy even thought Descartes had kept his real opinion secret. Descartes protested. At the end of the eighteenth century _Cabanis_ perfected Cartesian materialism in his treatise: _Rapport du physique et du moral de 1'homme_.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#48)

_Cartesian_ materialism still exists today in France. It has achieved great successes in _mechanical natural science_ which, “speaking _exactly_ and in the _prosaic sense_”, will be least of all reproached with _romanticism_.

The _metaphysics_ of the seventeenth century, represented in France by _Descartes,_ had _materialism_ as its _antagonist_ from its very birth. The latter’s opposition to Descartes was personified by _Gassendi_, the restorer of _Epicurean_ materialism. French and English materialism was always closely related to _Democritus_ and _Epicurus_. Cartesian metaphysics had another opponent in the _English_ materialist _Hobbes_. Gassendi and Hobbes triumphed over their opponent long after their death at the very time when metaphysics was already officially dominant in all French schools.

_Voltaire_ pointed out that the indifference of the French of the eighteenth century to the disputes between the Jesuits and the Jansenists[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#49) was due less to philosophy than to _Law’s_ financial speculations. So the downfall of seventeenth-century metaphysics can be explained by the materialistic theory of the eighteenth century only in so far as this theoretical movement itself is explained by the practical nature of French life at that time. This life was turned to the immediate present, to worldly enjoyment and worldly interests, to the _earthly_ world. Its anti-theological, anti-metaphysical, materialistic practice demanded corresponding anti-theological, anti-metaphysical, materialistic theories. Metaphysics had _in practice_ lost all credit. Here we have only to indicate briefly the _theoretical_ course of events.

In the seventeenth century metaphysics (cf. Descartes, Leibniz, and others) still contained a _positive_, secular element. It made discoveries in mathematics, physics and other exact sciences which seemed to come within its scope. This semblance was done away with as early as the beginning of the eighteenth century. The positive sciences broke away from metaphysics and marked out their independent fields. The whole wealth of metaphysics now consisted only of beings of thought and heavenly things, at the very time when real beings and earthly things began to be the centre of all interest. Metaphysics had become insipid. In the very year in which Malebranche and Arnauld, the last great French metaphysicians of the seventeenth century, died, _Helvétius_ and _Condillac_ were born.

The man who deprived seventeenth-century metaphysics and metaphysics in general of all _credit_ in the domain of _theory_ was _Pierre Bayle_. His weapon was _scepticism_, which he forged out of metaphysics’ own magic formulas. He himself proceeded at first from Cartesian metaphysics. Just as _Feuerbach_ by combating speculative theology was driven further to combat _speculative philosophy_, precisely because he recognised in speculation the last drop of theology, because he had to force theology to retreat from pseudo-science to _crude_, repulsive _faith_, so Bayle too was driven by religious doubt to doubt about the metaphysics which was the prop of that faith. He therefore critically investigated metaphysics in its entire historical development. He became its historian in order to write the history of its death. He refuted chiefly _Spinoza_ and _Leibniz_.

Pierre Bayle not only prepared the reception of materialism and of the philosophy of common sense in France by shattering metaphysics with his scepticism. He heralded the _atheistic society_ which was soon to come into existence by proving that a society consisting only of atheists is _possible,_ that an atheist can be a man worthy of respect, and that it is not by atheism but by superstition and idolatry that man debases himself.

To quote a French writer, _Pierre Bayle_ was “the last metaphysician in the sense of the seventeenth century and _the first philosopher in the sense of the eighteenth century_”.

Besides the negative refutation of seventeenth-century theology and metaphysics, a _positive, anti-metaphysical_ system was required. A book was needed which would systematise and theoretically substantiate the life practice of that time. _Locke’s_ treatise _An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding_ came from across the Channel as if in answer to a call. It was welcomed enthusiastically like a long-awaited guest.

The question arises: Is _Locke_ perhaps a disciple of _Spinoza_? “Profane” history can answer:

Materialism is the _natural-born_ son of _Great Britain_.[[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#50) Already the British schoolman, _Duns Scotus_, asked, “_whether it was impossible for matter to think_?”

In order to effect this miracle, he took refuge in God’s omnipotence, i.e., he made _theology_ preach _materialism_. Moreover, he was a nominalist.[[51]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#51) Nominalism, the _first form_ of materialism, is chiefly found among the _English_ schoolmen.

The real progenitor of _English materialism_ and all _modern experimental_ science is _Bacon_. To him natural philosophy is the only true philosophy, and _physics_ based upon the experience of the senses is the chiefest part of natural philosophy. _Anaxagoras_ and his _homoeomeriae_ [[52]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#52), _Democritus_ and his atoms, he often quotes as his authorities. According to him the _senses_ are infallible and the _source_ of all knowledge. All science is based on _experience_, and consists in subjecting the data furnished by the senses to a _rational method_ of investigation. Induction, analysis, comparison, observation, experiment, are the principal forms of such a rational method. Among the qualities inherent in _matter_, _motion_ is the first and foremost, not only in the form of _mechanical_ and _mathematical_ motion, _but_ chiefly in the form of an _impulse_, a _vital spirit_, a _tension_ — or a ‘_Qual’,_[[52a]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#52a) to use a term of Jakob Böhme’s — of matter. The primary forms of matter are the living, individualising _forces of being_ inherent in it and producing the distinctions between the species.

In _Bacon_, its first creator, materialism still holds back within itself in a naive way the germs of a many-sided development. On the one hand, matter, surrounded by a sensuous, poetic glamour, seems to attract man’s whole entity by winning smiles. On the other, the aphoristically formulated doctrine pullulates with inconsistencies imported from theology.

In its further evolution, materialism becomes _one-sided. Hobbes_ is the man who _systematises Baconian_ materialism. Knowledge based upon the senses loses its poetic blossom, it passes into the abstract experience of the _geometrician_. _Physical_ motion is sacrificed to _mechanical_ or _mathematical_ motion; _geometry_ is proclaimed as the queen of sciences. Materialism takes to _misanthropy_. If it is to overcome its opponent, _misanthropic, fleshless_ spiritualism, and that on the latter’s own ground, materialism has to chastise its own flesh and turn _ascetic_. Thus it passes into an _intellectual entity_; but thus, too, it evolves all the consistency, regardless of consequences, characteristic of the intellect.

Hobbes, as Bacon’s continuator, argues thus: if all human knowledge is furnished by the senses, then our concepts, notions, and ideas are but the phantoms of the real world, more or less divested of its sensual form. Philosophy can but give names to these phantoms. One name may be applied to more than one of them. There may even be names of names. But it would imply a contradiction if, on the one hand, we maintained that all ideas had their origin in the world of sensation, and, on the other, that a word was more than a word; that besides the beings known to us by our senses, beings which are one and all individuals, there existed also beings of a general, not individual, nature. An _unbodily substance_ is the same absurdity as an _unbodily body_. _Body, being_, _substance_, are but different terms for the same _reality_. It is impossible to separate thought from matter _that_ thinks. This matter is the substratum of all changes going on in the world. The word _infinite_ is _meaningless_, unless it states that our mind is capable of performing an endless process of addition. Only material things being perceptible, knowable to us, we cannot know _anything_ about the existence of God. My own existence alone is certain. Every human passion is a mechanical movement which has a beginning and an end. The objects of impulse are what we call good. Man is subject to the same laws as nature. Power and freedom are identical.

Hobbes had systematised Bacon without, however, furnishing a proof for Bacon’s fundamental principle, the origin of all human knowledge and ideas from the world of sensation.

It was _Locke_ who, in his _Essay on the Humane Understanding_, supplied this proof.

Hobbes had shattered the _theistic_ prejudices of Baconian materialism; Collins, Dodwell, Coward, Hartley, Priestley, similarly shattered the last theological bars that still hemmed in Locke’s sensationalism. At all events, for materialists, deism is but an easy-going way of getting rid of religion.

We have already mentioned how opportune Locke’s work was for the French. Locke founded the philosophy of _bon sens_, of common sense; i.e., he said indirectly that there cannot be any philosophy at variance with the healthy human senses and reason based on them.

Locke’s _immediate_ pupil, _Condillac_, who translated him into _French_, at once applied Locke’s sensualism against seventeenth-century _metaphysics_. He proved that the French had rightly rejected this metaphysics as a mere botch work of fancy and theological prejudice. He published a refutation of the systems of _Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz_ and _Malebranche_.

In his _Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines_ he expounded Locke’s ideas and proved that not only the soul, but the senses too, not only the art of creating ideas, but also the art of sensuous perception, are matters of _experience_ and _habit_. The whole development of man therefore depends on _education_ and _external circumstances_. It was only by _eclectic_ philosophy that Condillac was ousted from the French schools.

The difference between _French_ and _English_ materialism reflects the difference between the two nations. The French imparted to English materialism wit, flesh and blood, and eloquence. They gave it the temperament and grace that it lacked. They _civilised_ it.

In _Helvétius_, who also based himself on Locke, materialism assumed a really French character. Helvétius conceived it immediately in its application to social life (Helvétius, _De 1'homme_).[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#53) The sensory qualities and self-love, enjoyment and correctly understood personal interest are the basis of all morality. The natural equality of human intelligences, the unity of progress of reason and progress of industry, the natural goodness of man, and the omnipotence of education, are the main features in his system.

In _La Mettrie’s_ works we find a synthesis of Cartesian and English materialism. He makes use of Descartes’ physics in detail. His _L'homme machine_ is a treatise after the model of Descartes’ animal-machine. The physical part of Holbach’s _Système de la nature_ is also a result of the combination of French and English materialism, while the moral part is based essentially on the morality of Helvétius.[[54]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume04/footnote.htm#54) _Robinet_ (_De la nature_), the French materialist who had the most connection with metaphysics and was therefore praised by Hegel, refers explicitly to _Leibniz_.

We need not dwell on Volney, Dupuis, Diderot and others, any more than on the physiocrats, after we have proved the dual origin of French materialism from Descartes’ physics and English materialism, and the opposition of French materialism to seventeenth-century _metaphysics_, to the metaphysics of Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz. This opposition only became evident to the Germans after they themselves had come into opposition to _speculative metaphysics._

Just as _Cartesian_ materialism passes into _natural science proper_, the other trend of French materialism leads directly to _socialism_ and _communism_.

There is no need for any great penetration to see from the teaching of materialism on the original goodness and equal intellectual endowment of men, the omnipotence of experience, habit and education, and the influence of environment on man, the great significance of industry, the justification of enjoyment, etc., how necessarily materialism is connected with communism and socialism. If man draws all his knowledge, sensation, etc., from the world of the senses and the experience gained in it, then what has to be done is to arrange the empirical world in such a way that man experiences and becomes accustomed to what is truly human in it and that he becomes aware of himself as man. If correctly understood interest is the principle of all morality, man’s private interest must be made to coincide with the interest of humanity. If man is unfree in the materialistic sense, i.e., is free not through the negative power to avoid this or that, but through the positive power to assert his true individuality, crime must not be punished in the individual, but the anti-social sources of crime must be destroyed, and each man must be given social scope for the vital manifestation of his being. If man is shaped by environment, his environment must be made human. If man is social by nature, he will develop his true nature only in society, and the power of his nature must be measured not by the power of the separate individual but by the power of society. These and similar propositions are to be found almost literally even in the oldest French materialists. This is not the place to assess them. The apologia of vices by Mandeville, one of Locke’s early English followers, is typical of the socialist tendencies of materialism. He proves that in _modern_ society vice is _indispensable_ and _useful_. [Bernard de. Mandeville, _The Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits_] This was by no means an apologia for modern society.

_Fourier_ proceeds directly from the teaching of the French materialists. The _Babouvists_ were crude, uncivilised materialists, but developed communism, too, derives _directly_ from _French materialism_. The latter returned to its mother-country, _England_, in the form _Helvétius_ gave it. _Bentham_ based his system of _correctly understood interest_ on Helvétius’ morality, and _Owen_ proceeded from _Bentham’s_ system to found English communism. Exiled to England, the Frenchman _Cabet_ came under the influence of communist ideas there and on his return to France became the most popular, if the most superficial, representative of communism. Like Owen, the more scientific French Communists, _Dézamy_, _Gay_ and others, developed the teaching of _materialism_ as the teaching of _real humanism_ and the _logical_ basis of _communism_.

Where, then, did Herr Bauer or, _Criticism_, manage to acquire the documents for the Critical history of French materialism?

Engels' Dialectics of Nature

# II. Dialectics

##### (The general nature of dialectics to be developed as the science of interconnections, in contrast to metaphysics.)

It is, therefore, from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself. And indeed they can be reduced in the main to three:

The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and _vice versa_;  
The law of the interpenetration of opposites;  
The law of the negation of the negation.

All three are developed by Hegel in his idealist fashion as mere laws of _thought_: the first, in the first part of his _Logic_, in the _Doctrine of Being_; the second fills the whole of the second and by far the most important part of his _Logic,_ the _Doctrine of Essence_; finally the third figures as the fundamental law for the construction of the whole system. The mistake lies in the fact that these laws are foisted on nature and history as laws of thought, and not deduced from them. This is the source of the whole forced and often outrageous treatment; the universe, willy-nilly, is made out to be arranged in accordance with a system of thought which itself is only the product of a definite stage of evolution of human thought. If we turn the thing round, then everything becomes simple, and the dialectical laws that look so extremely mysterious in idealist philosophy at once become simple and clear as noonday.

Moreover, anyone who is even only slightly acquainted with his Hegel will be aware that in hundreds of passages Hegel is capable of giving the most striking individual illustrations from nature and history of the dialectical laws.

We are not concerned here with writing a handbook of dialectics, but only with showing that the dialectical laws are really laws of development of nature, and therefore are valid also for theoretical natural science. Hence we cannot go into the inner interconnection of these laws with one another.

1. The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and _vice versa_. For our purpose, we could express this by saying that in nature, in a manner exactly fixed for each individual case, qualitative changes can only occur by the quantitative addition or subtraction of matter or motion (so-called energy).

All qualitative differences in nature rest on differences of chemical composition or on different quantities or forms of motion (energy) or, as is almost always the case, on both. Hence it is impossible to alter the quality of a body without addition or subtraction of matter or motion, i.e. without quantitative alteration of the body concerned. In this form, therefore, Hegel's mysterious principle appears not only quite rational but even rather obvious.

It is surely hardly necessary to point out that the various allotropic and aggregational states of bodies, because they depend on various groupings of the molecules, depend on greater or lesser quantities of motion communicated to the bodies.

But what is the position in regard to change of form of motion, or so-called energy? If we change heat into mechanical motion or _vice versa_, is not the quality altered while the quantity remains the same? Quite correct. But it is with change of form of motion as with Heine's vices; anyone can be virtuous by himself, for vices two are always necessary. Change of form of motion is always a process that takes place between at least two bodies, of which one loses a definite quantity of motion of one quality (e.g. heat), while the other gains a corresponding quantity of motion of another quality (mechanical motion, electricity, chemical decomposition). Here, therefore, quantity and quality mutually correspond to each other. So far it has not been found possible to convert motion from one form to another inside a single isolated body.

We are concerned here in the first place with nonliving bodies; the same law holds for living bodies, but it operates under very complex conditions and at present quantitative measurement is still often impossible for us.

If we imagine any non-living body cut up into smaller and smaller portions, at first no qualitative change occurs. But this has a limit: if we succeed, as by evaporation, in obtaining the separate molecules in the free state, then it is true that we can usually divide these still further, yet only with a complete change of quality. The molecule is decomposed into its separate atoms, which have quite different properties from those of the molecule. In the case of molecules composed of various chemical elements, atoms or molecules of these elements themselves make their appearance in the place of the compound molecule; in the case of molecules of elements, the free atoms appear, which exert quite distinct qualitative effects: the free atoms of nascent oxygen are easily able to effect what the atoms of atmospheric oxygen, bound together in the molecule, can never achieve.

But the molecule is also qualitatively different from the mass of the body to which it belongs. It can carry out movements independently of this mass and while the latter remains apparently at rest, e.g. heat oscillations; by means of a change of position and of connection with neighbouring molecules it can change the body into an allotrope or a different state of aggregation.

Thus we see that the purely quantitative operation of division has a limit at which it becomes transformed into a qualitative difference: the mass consists solely of molecules, but it is something essentially different from the molecule, just as the latter is different from the atom. It is this difference that is the basis for the separation of mechanics, as the science of heavenly and terrestrial masses, from physics, as the mechanics of the molecule, and from chemistry, as the physics of the atom.

In mechanics, no qualities occur; at most, states such as equilibrium, motion, potential energy, which all depend on measurable transference of motion and are themselves capable of quantitative expression. Hence, in so far as qualitative change takes place here, it is determined by a corresponding quantitative change.

In physics, bodies are treated as chemically unalterable or indifferent; we have to do with changes of their molecular states and with the change of form of the motion which in all cases, at least on one of the two sides, brings the molecule into play. Here every change is a transformation of quantity into quality, a consequence of the quantitative change of the quantity of motion of one form or another that is inherent in the body or communicated to it. "Thus, for instance, the temperature of water is first of all indifferent in relation to its state as a liquid; but by increasing or decreasing the temperature of liquid water a point is reached at which this state of cohesion alters and the water becomes transformed on the one side into steam and on the other into ice." (Hegel, _Encyclopedia_, Collected Works, VI, p. 217.) Similarly, a definite minimum current strength is required to cause the platinum wire of an electric incandescent lamp to glow; and every metal has its temperature of incandescence and fusion, every liquid its definite freezing and boiling point at a given pressure - in so far as our means allow us to produce the temperature required; finally also every gas has its critical point at which it can be liquefied by pressure and cooling. In short, the so-called physical constants are for the most part nothing but designations of the nodal points at which quantitative addition or subtraction of motion produces qualitative alteration in the state of the body concerned, at which, therefore, quantity is transformed into quality.

The sphere, however, in which the law of nature discovered by Hegel celebrates its most important triumphs is that of chemistry. Chemistry can be termed the science of the qualitative changes of bodies as a result of changed quantitative composition. That was already known to Hegel himself (_Logic_, Collected Works, III, p. 488). As in the case of oxygen: if three atoms unite into a molecule, instead of the usual two, we get ozone, a body which is very considerably different from ordinary oxygen in its odour and reactions. Again, one can take the various proportions in which oxygen combines with nitrogen or sulphur, each of which produces a substance qualitatively different from any of the others! How different laughing gas (nitrogen monoxide N2O) is from nitric anhydride (nitrogen pentoxide, N2O5) ! The first is a gas, the second at ordinary temperatures a solid crystalline substance. And yet the whole difference in composition is that the second contains five times as much oxygen as the first, and between the two of them are three more oxides of nitrogen (N0, N2O3, NO2), each of which is qualitatively different from the first two and from each other.

This is seen still more strikingly in the homologous series of carbon compounds, especially in the simpler hydrocarbons. Of the normal paraffins, the lowest is methane, CH4; here the four linkages of the carbon atom are saturated by four atoms of hydrogen. The second, ethane, C2H6, has two atoms of carbon joined together and the six free linkages are saturated by six atoms of hydrogen. And so it goes on, with C3H8, C4H10, etc., according to the algebraic formula CnH2n+2, so that by each addition of CH2 a body is formed that is qualitatively distinct from the preceding one. The three lowest members of the series are gases, the highest known, hexadecane, C16H34, is a solid body with a boiling point of 270º C. Exactly the same holds good for the series of primary alcohols with formula CnH2n+20, derived (theoretically) from the paraffins, and the series of monobasic fatty acids (formula CnH2nO2). What qualitative difference can be caused by the quantitative addition of C3H6 is taught by experience if we consume ethyl alcohol, C2H12O, in any drinkable form without addition of other alcohols, and on another occasion take the same ethyl alcohol but with a slight addition of amyl alcohol, C5H12O, which forms the main constituent of the notorious fusel oil. One's head will certainly be aware of it the next morning, much to its detriment; so that one could even say that the intoxication, and subsequent "morning after" feeling, is also quantity transformed into quality, on the one hand of ethyl alcohol and on the other hand of this added C3H6.

In these series we encounter the Hegelian law in yet another form. The lower members permit only of a single mutual arrangement of the atoms. If, however, the number of atoms united into a molecule attains a size definitely fixed for each series, the grouping of the atoms in the molecule can take place in more than one way; so that two or more isomeric substances can be formed, having equal numbers of C, H, and 0 atoms in the molecule but nevertheless qualitatively distinct from one another. We can even calculate how many such isomers are possible for each member of the series. Thus, in the paraffin series, for C4H10 there are two, for C6H12 there are three; among the higher members the number of possible isomers mounts very rapidly. Hence once again it is the quantitative number of atoms in the molecule that determines the possibility and, in so far as it has been proved, also the actual existence of such qualitatively distinct isomers.

Still more. From the analogy of the substances with which we are acquainted in each of these series, we can draw conclusions as to the physical properties of the still unknown members of the series and, at least for the members immediately following the known ones, predict their properties, boiling point, etc., with fair certainty.

Finally, the Hegelian law is valid not only for compound substances but also for the chemical elements themselves. We now know that "the chemical properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic weights" (Roscoe-Schorlemmer, _Complete Text-Book of Chemistry_, II, p. 823), and that, therefore, their quality is determined by the quantity of their atomic weight. And the test of this has been brilliantly carried out. Mendeleyev proved that various gaps occur in the series of related elements arranged according to atomic weights indicating that here new elements remain to be discovered. He described in advance the general chemical properties of one of these unknown elements, which he termed eka-aluminium, because it follows after aluminium in the series beginning with the latter, and he predicted its approximate specific and atomic weight as well as its atomic volume. A few years later, Lecoq de Boisbaudran actually discovered this element, and Mendeleyev's predictions fitted with only very slight discrepancies. Eka-aluminium was realised in gallium (ibid., p. 828). By means of the - unconscious - application of Hegel's law of the transformation of quantity into quality, Mendeleyev achieved a scientific feat which it is not too bold to put on a par with that of Leverrier in calculating the orbit of the still unknown planet Neptune.

In biology, as in the history of human society, the same law holds good at every step, but we prefer to dwell here on examples from the exact sciences, since here the quantities are accurately measurable and traceable.

Probably the same gentlemen who up to now have decried the transformation of quantity into quality as mysticism and incomprehensible transcendentalism will now declare that it is indeed something quite self-evident, trivial, and commonplace, which they have long employed, and so they have been taught nothing new.

But to have formulated for the first time in its universally valid form a general law of development of nature, society, and thought, will always remain an act of historic importance. And if these gentlemen have for years caused quantity and quality to be transformed into one another, without knowing what they did, then they will have to console themselves with Moliere's Monsieur Jourdain who had spoken prose all his life without having the slightest inkling of it.

The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts (see the quotation from Philo on [Heraclitus](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#heraclitus) at the beginning of Section III, “On Cognition,” in [Lasalle’s](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/l/a.htm#lassalle) book on Heraclitus[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm#f1)) is the _essence_ (one of the “essentials,” one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of dialectics. That is precisely how [Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#gfw-hegel), too, puts the matter ([Aristotle](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/a/r.htm#aristotle) in his _Metaphysics_ continually _grapples_ with it and _combats_ Heraclitus and Heraclitean ideas).

The correctness of this aspect of the content of [dialectics](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dialectics) must be tested by the history of science. This aspect of dialectics (e.g. in [Plekhanov](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/p/l.htm#plekhanov)) usually receives inadequate attention: the identity of opposites is taken as the sum-total of _examples_ **[**“for example, a seed,” “for example, primitive communism.” The same is true of [Engels](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/e/n.htm#engels). But it is “in the interests of popularisation...”**]** and not as a _law of cognition_ (and as a law of the objective world).

|In mathematics: + and —. Differential and integral.  <br>In mechanics: action and reaction.  <br>In physics: positive and negative electricity.  <br>In chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms.  <br>In social science: the class struggle.|

The [identity of opposites](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/u/n.htm#unity-of-opposites) (it would be more correct, perhaps, to say their “unity,”—although the difference between the terms identity and unity is not particularly important here. In a certain sense both are correct) is the recognition (discovery) of the contradictory, _mutually exclusive_, opposite tendencies in _all_ phenomena and processes of nature (_including_ mind and society). The condition for the knowledge of all processes of the world in their “_self-movement,_” in their spontaneous development, in their real life, is the knowledge of them as a unity of opposites. Development is the “struggle” of opposites. The two basic (or two possible? Or two historically observable?) conceptions of development (evolution) are: development as decrease and increase, as repetition, _and_ development as a unity of opposites (the division of a unity into mutually exclusive opposites and their reciprocal relation).

In the first conception of motion, _self_ - movement, its _driving_ force, its source, its motive, remains in the shade (or this source is made _external_—God, subject, etc.). In the second conception the chief attention is directed precisely to knowledge of the source of _“self”_ - movement.

The first conception is lifeless, pale and dry. The second is living. The second _alone_ furnishes the key to the “self-movement” of everything existing; it alone furnishes the key to “leaps,” to the “break in continuity,” to the “transformation into the opposite,” to the destruction of the old and the emergence of the new.

The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute.

||_NB_: The distinction between [subjectivism](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/u.htm#subjective) (scepticism, sophistry, etc.) and dialectics, incidentally, is that in ([objective](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#objective)) dialectics the difference between the [relative and the absolute](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/b.htm#absolute) is itself relative. For objective dialectics there _is_ an absolute _within_ the relative. For subjectivism and sophistry the relative is only relative and excludes the absolute.|

In his [_Capital_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm), Marx first analyses the simplest, most ordinary and fundamental, most common and everyday _relation_ of bourgeois (commodity) society, a relation encountered billions of times, viz., the exchange of commodities. In this very simple phenomenon (in this “cell” of [bourgeois society](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/b/o.htm#bourgeois-society)) analysis reveals _all_ the contradictions (or the germs of _all_ contradictions) of modern society. The subsequent exposition shows us the development (_both_ growth _and_ movement) of these contradictions and of this society in the Σ[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm#f2) of its individual parts. From its beginning to its end.

Such must also be the method of exposition (i.e., study) of dialectics in general (for with Marx the dialectics of bourgeois society is only a particular case of dialectics). To begin with what is the simplest, most ordinary, common, etc., with **any** _proposition:_ the leaves of a tree are green; John is a man: Fido is a dog, etc. Here already we have _dialectics_ (as Hegel’s genius recognised): the **individual** is the _universal_. (cf. Aristoteles, _Metaphisik,_ translation by Schegler, Bd. II, S. 40, 3. Buch, 4. Kapitel, 8-9: “denn natürlich kann man nicht der Meinung sin, daß es ein Haus (a house in general) gebe außer den sichtbaren Häusern,” “ού γρ άν ΰείημεν είναί τινα οίχίαν παρα τχς τινάς οίχίας”).[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm#f3) Consequently, the opposites (the individual is opposed to the universal) are identical: the individual exists only in the connection that leads to the universal. The universal exists only in the individual and through the individual. Every individual is (in one way or another) a universal. Every universal is (a fragment, or an aspect, or the essence of) an individual. Every universal only approximately embraces all the individual objects. Every individual enters incompletely into the universal, etc., etc. Every individual is connected by thousands of transitions with other **kinds** of individuals (things, phenomena, processes) etc. _Here_ _already_ we have the elements, the germs, the concepts of _necessity,_ of objective connection in nature, etc. Here already we have the contingent and the necessary, the phenomenon and the essence; for when we say: John is a man, Fido is a dog, _this_ is a leaf of a tree, etc., we _disregard_ a number of attributes as _contingent_; we separate the essence from the appearance, and counterpose the one to the other.

Thus in any proposition we can (and must) disclose as in a “nucleus” (“cell”) the germs of _all_ the elements of dialectics, and thereby show that dialectics is a property of all human knowledge in general. And natural science shows us (and here again it must be demonstrated in _any_ simple instance) objective nature with the same qualities, the transformation of the individual into the universal, of the contingent into the necessary, transitions, modulations, and the reciprocal connection of opposites. Dialectics _is_ the theory of knowledge of (Hegel and) Marxism. This is the “aspect” of the matter (it is not “an aspect” but the _essence_ of the matter) to which Plekhanov, not to speak of other Marxists, paid no attention.

The Meaning of Hegel's Logic

# V: Formal Logic and Dialectics

Formal logic, which _was_ logic prior to Hegel, saw its field of study as restricted to the laws by means of which the truth of one proposition followed from that of another.

For example, in the words of John Stuart Mill:

Logic, is the science of the operations of the understanding which are subservient to the estimation of evidence: both the process itself of advancing from known truths to unknown, and all other intellectual operations in so far as auxiliary to this. It includes, therefore, the operation of Naming; ... Definition and Classification. [[_System of Logic_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1843/logic.htm#07), J S Mill]

Ilyenkov explains in his [essay on Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/essay5.htm), that Hegel's revolution in logic was effected by widening the scope of logic and the field of observation upon which the validity of logic could be tested, from logic manifested in the articulation of propositions to the manifestation of logic in _all_ aspects of human practice.

Formal logic also put outside of its scope, the proof of primary or axiomatic truths or the derivation of the categories by which means of which propositions indicated reality. Hegel also broadened logic to include critique or derivation of these categories.

Either way, logic is concerned only with _truth_, that is, with thinking which corresponds to or reflects the world outside of thought, outside of individual consciousness, and further, the criterion of truth for logic is the extent to which it provides an adequate guide to practice.

Just as thought reflects the material world and can contain nothing that does not already exist in the material world, or at least the conditions for its formation, human practice is practice of material human beings in the material world, and there can be nothing in human practice which fundamentally contradicts Nature.

Thus, in elaborating the most general laws governing the development of the social practice, Hegel necessarily uncovered laws which are not unique or special to the human condition, but are objective, material laws of Nature. So, in looking not just at what thought thought of itself, but at what it did, Hegel not only and not so much discovered a far richer means of understanding individual scientific consciousness, but more importantly, the laws governing the development of collective spiritual, cultural or social activity and of the material world in general.

Hegel did not disprove or eradicate formal logic at all, he merely defined its immanent limits and uncovered its inner contradictions, its origin and its own limits, beyond which it necessarily passed over into something else, its life and its death; he negated it; he _sublated_ it: formal logical is both overcome and maintained with dialectical logic.

Formal logic is at its most powerful, not at all when it is treated as something of little use to be violated at will, but on the contrary, when it is utilised with the maximum consistency and thoroughness, but with consciousness of its immanent limits and an understanding of when and how it supersedes itself. Nothing is more valueless than uncritical playing with logical contradiction and inconsistency justified by thoughtless and shallow reference to dialectics.

Although I think George Novack is completely wrong in his treatment of formal logic in _The Logic of Marxism_, his basic initial proposition on the validity of formal logic is profoundly correct:

What characteristics of material reality are reflected and conceptually reproduced in these formal laws of thought? The law of identity formulates the material fact that definite things, and traits of things, persist and maintain recognisable similarity amidst all their phenomenal changes. Wherever essential continuity exists in reality, the law of identity is applicable. ...

We could neither act nor think correctly without consciously or unconsciously obeying this law. If we couldn't recognise ourselves as the same person from moment to moment and from day to day - and there are people who cannot, who through amnesia or some other mental disturbance have lost their consciousness of self-identity - we would be lost. But the law of identity is no less valid for the rest of the universe than for human consciousness. It applies every day and everywhere to social life. If we couldn't recognise the same piece of metal through all its various operations, we couldn't get very far with production. If a farmer couldn't follow the corn he sows from the seed to the ear and then on to the meal, agriculture would be impossible. ...

The infant takes a great step forward in understanding the nature of the world when he grasps for the first time the fact that the mother who feeds him remains the same person throughout various acts of feeding. The recognition of this truth is nothing but a particular instance of the recognition of the law of identity. [_The Logic of Marxism_, Lecture 1, Part 4]

#### The Law of Identity

Thus, (continuing our theme of approaching Hegel's _Logic_ from the point of view of a theory of cognition) perception begins when we _recognise something_, when we perceive something as _persistent_ in the stream of "one damn thing after another" of immediate perception, when we can say "A = A". The whole of formal logic rests on this identity of a thing with itself, with recognition of the continuity of something. The whole of formal logic falls to pieces when "A not = A".

It is manifestly obvious that identity is an _abstraction_, and:

If it be the office of comparison to reduce existing differences to Identity, the science which most perfectly fulfills that end is **mathematics**. The reason of that is that quantitative difference is only the difference which is quite external. ... [[_Shorter Logic_, § 117n](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#SL117n_1)] ... If quantity is not reached through the action of thought, but taken uncritically from our generalised image of it, we are liable to exaggerate the range of its validity, or even to raise it to the height of an absolute category. And that such a danger is real, we see when the title of _exact science_ is restricted to those sciences the objects of which can be submitted to mathematical calculation. [[_Shorter Logic_, § 99n](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slquant.htm#SL99n)]

But it is equally obvious that identity and quantity and mathematics are abstractions which _reflect material reality_, and identity is an abstraction which, as Novack points out, is the fundamental basis of human practice. While _in a certain limited sense_ the world is recreated anew every minute, we act, _in practice_, for **most of the time**, on the basis first of all of continuity.

As referred to in the above quote from _The Shorter Logic_, the science of Identity is Mathematics. Mathematics is the science in which formal logic is applied in a specific sense, and in this special sense, is adhered to inflexibly and with unquestionable heuristic value.

In mathematics proper, it should be remembered, "A" indicates absolutely anything; it is quite _meaningless_ (Being = Nothing) and in the proposition "A = A", the operative symbol is the "=". The proposition is an empty tautology in so far as it is deemed to make any statement about A. If we make a non-mathematical interpretation of "=", such as "this A is the same as that A" then the statement is tautological if we allow that the A refers to one and the same. If we allow that the first A is distinct from the second A, then the statement is real and valid and dialectical, but not mathematical. (But of course, if mathematics was excluded from being ultimately interpreted or applied "non-mathematically", it would be utterly lacking in content).

This is not at all to say that dialectics is absent from mathematics. Unthinkable. The movement from one proposition to another is always dialectical and only sometimes and in a certain respect formal. But without formal logic, there is no mathematics. While it is nonsense to elevate mathematics to be a model for all sciences (as was common in past centuries), it is nonsensical to devalue mathematics as a science.

But formal logic is not at all limited to mathematics. The first condition for the validity or relevance of formal logic is the relative validity of identity in respect of the precise movement of cognition in question. And Hegel had great fun of course with the struggle mathematics had with the invention of calculus. Leibnitz and Newton created this fantastically powerful instrument (which among other things is the principal method by which the laws of Nature may be expressed in general form, and which laid the basis for a new revolution in applied mathematics and natural science), only by blatantly bluffing their way over crying formal logical sleight-of-hand. It has only been in recent years that mathematics has been able to provide a formal logical derivation of calculus from its foundations. Leibnitz and Newton thought dialectically, and let posterity look after the formal proof of their discovery.

In practice we regard the world as not only subject to change, but subject to _our change_. In scientific thinking we regard objects critically, as subject to analysis and synthesis. To the extent that we regard an object critically, regard reality as something to be changed, then we specifically reject the law of identity, and assert that "A not = A", and formal logic takes a break. Here we cannot grasp an "A" with the aim of carrying it forward to use in other relations, but aim to revolutionise it and uncover from its clothes a new A, A-, if you like.

In the Chapter on Reflection in _The Logic_, Hegel deals with the Law of Identity, Law of Excluded Middle, Law of Non-Contradiction and Law of Sufficient Ground as a series of propositions or relations which unfold, each negating the other in a series of dialectical stages. These moments are discussed above in _The Meaning of Reflection._ For now, I would like to reflect on their status in formal logic, for while all Hegel's nineteenth century readers would have been trained in formal logic, that is probably not the case today.

#### The Law of Excluded Middle

The Law of Excluded Middle states that if a proposition A is not true then its denial "not-A" is true. Even within the narrow limits of formal logic this "law" is unreliable, and common sense will confirm the view that this line of reasoning is unreliable. The Dutch logician Brouwer reconstructed mathematical logic by eliminating the law of Excluded Middle from the rule book, and showed that mathematics is little the worse for the loss. Indeed, the Quantum Logic of Weisäcker is based upon the inclusion of a truth value of "indeterminate".

#### The Law of Non-Contradiction

The Law of Non-Contradiction states that both a proposition, A, and its denial, not-A, cannot be true within the domain of a single "theory", within the domain of validity of the law of identity, "A = A". This law is indeed fundamental to formal logic.

It is well known that the consistent application of the basic set of formal logical principles leads to "antinomies", or flat contradictions. This discovery contributed to Hegel's revolution in logic, but also led to further development _within_ formal logic. Nowadays, the conditions which give rise to such contradictions are well known, and formal logic is able to proceed while reliably avoiding such "bad" contradictions by the introduction of a number of proscriptions on the categories.

At first glance, it would seem that an explanation of these limitations would be of great significance, but we will not pursue the question here.

#### The Law of Sufficient Ground

In so far as the Law of Sufficient Ground may be said to exist in formal logic, it is the so-called law of decidability, that any proposition which is valid within a given theory, may be proved or disproved. In 1931, Kurt Gödel disproved this thesis in his famous Gödel's Theorem. This discovery brought about a huge crisis in the world of mathematics and logic, but it can hardly be said that it reduced formal logic to a nullity.

Nevertheless, Hegel's comment in regard to the method of proceeding from unproven axioms is very apt and is what essentially distinguishes dialectical logic from formal logic:

Formal Logic asks these sciences not to accept their subject-matter as it is immediately given; and yet herself lays down a law of thought without deducing it - in other words, without exhibiting its mediation. [[_Shorter Logic_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#SL121n) § 121n]

Further, the absolute status of this law is rejected in quantum mechanics, although Einstein held to his dying day that this theory could not be regarded as complete, and that therefore further grounds for the behaviour of quantum-mechanical systems were awaiting discovery. This topic is well worthy of further discussion, but will not be pursued here.

However, more significantly, complexity theory has demonstrated that phenomena in a complex system follow from the inner structure of the system which in principle cannot be derived from that inner structure by the methods of formal logic. The empirically established limitation of formal logic is more or less widely recognised outside of professional mathematicians, and is broadly the same as the commonly accepted fallaciousness of _reductionism_.

### The Notion, Judgement and Syllogism -  
Universal, Particular and Individual

The other component of formal logic is the syllogism, which Hegel subjects to criticism in the Doctrine of the Notion.

The syllogism is the method of inference, first developed by formal logic, in which from two statements a third is inferred. For example, "All A are B", "C is an A", _therefore_ "C is B".

The Universal, Particular and Individual are categories closely related to the syllogism:

- the Universal is a truth which applies always and everywhere, such as "A", "B" (notions) and "All A are B" in the above example, as aspects of knowledge are the outcome of a protracted period of social development;
- the Individual ("C" in the above example) is knowledge as given in immediate perception;
- the Particular is a kind of joining of individual and universal, a finite but generalised truth ("C is an A" and "C is B").

All the above concepts have undergone considerable development in the history of philosophy, and the above only indicates the general scope of the concepts.

Hegel's critique of the formal logical concept of syllogism is very profound. In the first place, his understanding of _the Notion_ (the "A" and the "B") is fundamentally at odds with that of formal logic as is his notion of Judgement (the "_is_"). Whereas, for formal logic, the Universal, Individual and Particular exist side-by-side and independently, in external relation to one another, for Hegel these categories are moments of development, essentially and generically connected with one another.

In the second place, his Notion of the Notion demonstrates in practice this more profound approach and provides the archetypal demonstration of his method of deriving a concept from its own immanent nature, rather than by external definition as an abstract universal.

In the third place, he anticipates the materialist critique of logic by demonstrating that the syllogism and its categories of universal, particular and individual are "forms of the notion, the vital spirit of the actual world".

The Logic of the Notion is usually treated as a science of form only, and understood to deal with the form of notion, judgement, and syllogism as form, without in the least touching the question whether anything is true. The answer to that question is supposed to depend on the content only. .... On the contrary they really are, as forms of the notion, the vital spirit of the actual world. That only is true of the actual which is true in virtue of these forms, through them and in them. As yet, however, the truth of these forms has never been considered or examined on their own account any more than their necessary interconnection. ...

The Notion as Notion contains the three following 'moments' or functional parts. (1) The first is **Universality** - meaning that it is in free equality with itself in its specific character. (2) The second is **Particularity** - that is, the specific character, in which the universal continues serenely equal to itself. (3) The third is **Individuality** - meaning the reflection-into-self of the specific characters of universality and particularity; which negative self-unity has complete and original determinateness, without any loss to its self-identity or universality. [[_Shorter Logic_, § 162](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slsubjec.htm#SL162_3)]

### The Notion and the Abstract Universal

For formal logic the form of the category is considered to lie outside its domain, with a minor exception in relation to limits which are prescribed in order to avoid antinomies. The nearest formal logic can come to conceiving of the Notion is the "class", which indicates by some effective means, individuals to which can be attributed an "abstract universal". An "abstract universal" is that property which is common to many individuals.

The notion is generally associated in our minds with abstract generality, and on that account it is often described as a general conception. We speak, accordingly, of the notions of colour, plant, animal, etc. They are supposed to be arrived at by neglecting the particular features which distinguish the different colours, plants, and animals from each other, and by retaining those common to them all. ... But the universal of the notion is not a mere sum of features common to several things, confronted by a particular which enjoys an existence of its own. It is, on the contrary, self-particularising or self-specifying, and with undimmed clearness finds itself at home in its antithesis. For the sake both of cognition and of our practical conduct, it is of the utmost importance that the real universal should not be confused with what is merely held in common. ...

The universal in its true and comprehensive meaning is a thought which, as we know, cost thousands of years to make it enter into the consciousness of men. [[_Shorter Logic_, § 163n](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slsubjec.htm#SL163n1), The Subjective Notion]

No wonder Hegel regards the logic based around the Notion as abstract universal as simply a "yawn"! It is very trivial stuff, and when not trivial usually false. When rigorously elaborated to an exceedingly high level of complexity, as in developed branches of mathematics, it can provide a substance of some interest, but is of a very restricted domain of truth, which is the same as the domain marked out by the extent of validity of the Law of Identity, and broadly recognisable as what is known in mathematics as Set Theory, the Theory of Groups, and so on.

Classes (abstract universals) in mathematics lead a kind of "double existence", once as a "collection" of "elements" having a given property and secondly as the property which constitutes the notion of the class or set. For example, "the working class" is (to the formalist) on the one hand a list of the names of employees taken from the Taxation Office records and on the other the definition "people who earn a living from a wage or salary".

Again, as an indispensable, though far from exhaustive, component of mathematics, the abstract universal has its place. But in the context of creative social or natural theory that is a very small place.

But again, the same comments as above apply. In so far as "A = A", as the relations between things remain unchanged, as the things conceived of remain separate and distinct, and things remain identical with their Notion, the notion of abstract universal retains validity. The whole of Hegel's _Logic_ constitutes a more profound concept of "notion", and from the standpoint of Hegel's Notion, it is easy to see how limited is formal logic's notion of Abstract Universal. These aspects of formal logic are treated in Hegel's Part III of _The Logic_, Doctrine of the Notion.

The issue is, how to understand and recognise the boundaries of formal logic.

### The limits and negation of formal logic

There is not a simple, formal answer to this question of course. Otherwise formal logic would have already discovered it!

The whole of Hegel's _Logic_ teaches us how to determine the limits of a concept or proposition. For example, in the Doctrine of Being, we study the dialectic of Measure, which expresses the limits of Quantity and Quality. Trotsky's article _The ABC of Materialist Dialectics_ focuses on this limitation of formal logic, that every concept has its limits of "tolerance". In the Doctrine of Essence we study, among other things, the dialectic of Form and Content. In short, Hegel, demonstrates and teaches the "art of handling concepts". As Hegel more than once complains, formal logic accepts uncritically not just the things it sees in the objective world, but the categories it uses to grasp reality.

In unfolding the limitations of formal logic from its "germ" in the law of identity - "A = A", Hegel demonstrates how all concepts must be understood, not by simple abstract universal definitions, but as dialectical, internally contradictory subject-object relations, which are nothing but moments abstracted from, or plucked out of a continually moving and developing reality. Our Notions of the world can only adequately approximate the world to the extent that our Notions reflect that essential movement and life.

For example, it is easy to say: "A is a B", "All B are C", therefore "A is C", but what is a B? "Arthur is a policeman", "Policemen work for a wage", therefore "Arthur is a worker", therefore, ...etc., etc. And you can push the definitions around as much as you like, making them "more precise", and it does take you one whit closer to an understanding of the social relations between individuals. "Worker" is an individual _and_ a social category. Social categories have existence and laws which cannot be equated with many individual relations. The working class cannot be pulled out of the records of the Taxation Office listing all those who earnt wages in the last financial year. The whole is _not_ equal to the sum of the parts.

### Complexity, Mathematics and Dialectics

This is the **first** limitation of formal logic, what could be called its "inner boundary". The **second**, its "outer boundary", is that imposed by complexity. If a system is sufficiently complex and "rich", then the phenomena that arise in it cannot be reduced to the properties of the system's component sub-systems. For example, it is fairly well-known that attempts by macro-economists to model the world economy using, for example, up to 4,000 simultaneous differential equations, invariably fails to predict any significant phenomena outside of the usual ebb and flow of indicators.

Over the past decade, a new science has emerged known as "Complexity". This science uses computer simulation to empirically investigate the outcome of **very few, very simple** formal rules governing the interaction of a large number of component sub-systems, or individuals, in a system.

The need for an empirical science to study these phenomena is explained by a corollary of Gödel's Theorem discovered by Alan Turing, the founder of Computer Science: that in any computational system there at least one algorithm, the results of which cannot in principle be predicted. This is a bit of truism for anyone who has programmed a complex computer system!

The implication for understanding the relation of formal and dialectical logic is profound. In any complex (i.e. real) system, the phenomena exhibited arise out of the relations of the component systems in a way which cannot _in principle_ be deduced by formal logical analysis; and this is true even where the atomic relations are absolutely simple and static.

Such complex systems fall initially into two kinds: those where the atomic relations lead to a static or repetitive structure in the mass, where the mechanical application of formal logical analysis is valid, and those that lead to chaos, where the Law of Large Numbers and probability theory is valid. A simple measure derived from the atomic relations indicates whether the system is likely to be structured or chaotic. But there is also a third case, the border-line or transition case, where the atomic relations lead to "complex behaviour", rich in form, leaps, sudden transformations and dynamic structures, all _in principle_ unpredictable from the standpoint of formal logic.

Furthermore, it has been empirically established that where the sub-systems have the capacity to replicate and mutate in some way (the normal condition of any significant "real" system), thus modifying the balance of the atomic relations, the system will in time either "die", or gravitate to a complex _transition_ system, from a chaotic or structured state to a complex one, from a stable, predictable system to one giving rise to complex, "revolutionary" phenomena. Empirical computer simulation has reproduced analogues of systems (neurological or social) which learn, the origin of life from a "primeval soup", punctuated evolution, etc.

The scientists who are doing this work have expressed serious concerns about the state of the world economy, especially after the end of the relatively stable Cold War Period, and have tended to become fans of Heraclitus or Taoism; interestingly, none of them have so far recognised that a very precise science of the logic of complexity already exists in the Logic of Hegel.

### Formal Logic in Nature and Society

As remarked above, formal logic reflects the relative stability in Nature. Formal logic works fine in physics, so long as atoms are hard little balls; but as soon as quantum behaviour slips into the picture and particles "leap", transform one into another, disappear and reappear, behave like waves and so on, formal logic gets into trouble.

But it should be noted, for very very much physics and chemistry even today, the "hard ball" model of the atom is quite sufficient for the purposes of practical and theoretical work.

In politics, the electoral system is the very embodiment of formal logic: 100,000 isolated human atoms utter "Yes" or "No" to a single question, and from this the most dramatic and usually desperately inadequate conclusions follow.

Ilyenkov  
DIALECTICAL LOGIC

---

### INTRODUCTION

---

  

The task, [bequeathed to us by Lenin](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_178), of creating a Logic (with a capital ‘L’), i.e. of a systematically developed exposition of dialectics understood as the logic and theory of knowledge of modern materialism, has become particularly acute today. The clearly marked dialectical character of the problems arising in every sphere of social life and scientific knowledge is making it more and more clear that only Marxist-Leninist dialectics has the capacity to be the method of scientific understanding and practical activity, and of actively helping scientists in their theoretical comprehension of experimental and factual data and in solving the problems they meet in the course of research.

In the past ten or fifteen years, quite a few works have been written devoted to separate branches that are part of the whole of which we still only dream; they can justly be regarded as paragraphs, even chapters, of the future _Logic_, as more or less finished blocks of the building being erected. One cannot, of course, cement these ‘blocks’ mechanically into a whole; but since the task of a systematic exposition of dialectical logic can only be solved by collective efforts, we must at least determine the most general principles of joint work. In the essays presented here we attempt to concretise some of the points of departure of such collective work.

In philosophy, more than in any other science, as Hegel remarked with some regret in his _Phenomenology of Mind_, ‘[the end or final result seems ... to have absolutely expressed the complete fact itself in its very nature; contrasted with that the mere process of bringing it to light would seem, properly speaking, to have no essential significance](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm)’.

That is very aptly put. So long as dialectics (dialectical logic) is looked upon as a simple tool for proving a previously accepted thesis (irrespective of whether it was initially advanced as the rules of mediaeval disputes required, or only disclosed at the end of the argument, in order to create the illusion of not being preconceived, that is, of saying: “Look, here is what we have obtained although we did not assume it”), it will remain something of ‘no essential significance’. When dialectics is converted into a simple tool for proving a previously accepted (or given) thesis, it becomes a sophistry only outwardly resembling dialectics, but empty of content. And if it is true that real dialectical logic takes on life not in ‘naked results’, and not in the ‘tendency’ of the movement of thought, but only in the form of ‘[the result along with the process of arriving at it](https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/comment/lois1.htm)’, then during the exposition of dialectics as Logic, we must reckon with this truth. For it is impossible to go to the other extreme, taking the view that we had allegedly not set ourselves any aim determining the means and character of our activity from the very outset in the course of our analysis of the problem, but had set out swimming at random. And we are therefore obliged, in any case, to say clearly, at the very beginning, what the ‘object’ is in which we want to discover the intrinsically necessary division into parts.

Our ‘object’ or ‘subject matter’ in general, and on the whole, is thought, thinking; and dialectical Logic has as its aim the development of a scientific representation of thought in those necessary moments, and moreover in the necessary sequence, that do not in the least depend either on our will or on our consciousness. In other words Logic must show how thought develops if it is scientific, if it reflects, i.e. reproduces in concepts, an object existing outside our consciousness and will and independently of them, in other words, creates a mental reproduction of it, reconstructs its self-development, recreates it in the logic of the movement of concepts so as to recreate it later in fact (in experiment or in practice). Logic then is the theoretical representation of such thinking.

From what we have said it will be clear that we understand thought (thinking) as the ideal component of the real activity of social people transforming both external nature and themselves by their labour.

Dialectical logic is therefore not only a universal scheme of subjective activity creatively transforming nature, but is also at the same time a universal scheme of the changing of any natural or socio-historical material in which this activity is fulfilled and with the objective requirements of which it is always connected. That, in our opinion, is what the real gist of Lenin’s thesis on the identity (not ‘unity’ only, but precisely identity, full coincidence) of dialectics, logic and the theory of knowledge of the modern, scientific. i.e. materialist, world outlook consists in. This approach preserves as one of the definitions of dialectics that given by Frederick Engels (‘[dialectics, however, is nothing more than the science of the general laws of the motion and development of nature, human society, and thought](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch13.htm)’, i.e. of natural and socio-historical development, and not ‘specifically subjective’ laws and forms of thought).

We think that one can unite dialectics and materialism in precisely that way, and show that Logic, being dialectical, is not only the science of ‘thinking’ but also the science of development of all things, both material and ‘spiritual’. Understood in that way Logic can also be the genuine science of the reflection of the movement of the world in the movement of concepts. Otherwise it is inevitably transformed, as has happened to it in the hands of Neopositivists, into a purely technical discipline, a description of systems of manipulations with the terms of language.

The concretisation of the general definition of Logic presented above must obviously consist in disclosing the concepts composing it, above all the concept of thought (thinking). Here again a purely dialectical difficulty arises, namely, that to define this concept fully, i.e. concretely, also means to ‘write’ Logic, because a full description cannot by any means be given by a ‘definition’ but only by ‘developing the essence of the matter’.

The concept ‘concept’ itself is also very closely allied with the concept of thought. To give a ‘definition’ of it here would be easy, but would it be of any use? If we, adhering to a certain tradition in Logic, tend to understand by ‘concept’ neither ‘sign’ nor ‘term defined through other terms’, and not simply a ‘reflection of the essential or intrinsic attributes of things’ (because here the meaning of the insidious words ‘essential’ and ‘intrinsic’ come to the fore), but the gist of the matter, then it would be more correct, it seems to us, to limit ourselves in relation to definition rather to what has been said, and to start to consider ‘the gist of the matter’, to begin with abstract, simple definitions accepted as far as possible by everyone. In order to arrive at the ‘concrete’, or in this case at a Marxist-Leninist understanding of the essence of Logic and its concretely developed ‘concept’.

Everything we have said determines the design and plan of our book. At first glance it may seem that it is, if not wholly, then to a considerable degree, a study in the history of philosophy. But the ‘historical’ collisions of realising the ‘matter of Logic’ is not an end-in-itself for us, but only the factual material through which the clear outlines of the ‘logic of Matter’ gradually show through [See Marx’s [Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/ch01.htm#036)], those very general outlines of dialectics as Logic which, critically corrected and materialistically rethought by Marx, Engels and Lenin, also characterise our understanding of this science.

August Thalheimer: Introduction to Dialectical Materialism

### 10 - Dialectics I

In this chapter we will discuss dialectics proper. Previous chapters have shown that dialectics has a history which embraces many thousands of years and that it has passed through various stages of development. Disregarding the beginnings of dialectics in Indian and Chinese philosophy, the following main stages can be distinguished: (1) the dialectics of the old Greek philosophers of nature, Heraclitus; (2) the second and higher stage, the dialectics of Plato and Aristotle; (3) Hegelian dialectics; and (4) materialistic dialectics. Dialectics itself has undergone a dialectical development. Heraclitus, representing the first stage, develops the dialectics of one-after-the-other; Plato and Aristotle, representing the second stage, develop the dialectics of one-beside-the-other. The latter is in opposition to the dialectics of the first stage, being its negation. Hegel embraces both preceding stages of development and raises them to a higher stage. He develops the dialectics of the one-after-the-other and the one-beside-the-other, but in an idealistic form; in other words, he develops an historico-idealistic dialectics. The dialectics of antiquity was limited. I pointed out earlier where the basis of this limitation is to be found: namely, in the mode of production and the class relations of ancient Greece, particularly in the slave economy and in the social relations resulting from this slave economy. Not until the advent of materialistic dialectics were these limitations completely overcome. This new dialectics is not restricted; it is universalized. And here too I will briefly point out the relation of this universalized dialectics to the fundamental relations of class and production. Materialistic dialectics is developed by workers who have the working-class point of view, the point of view of the proletarian revolution. This point of view demands the elimination of classes, and consequently the elimination of class society. As a result of the elimination of classes and class society, the last limitation on social development and on the idea of development in general collapses. For Aristotle as well as for Plato and even Hegel, class society itself was something that development could not transcend. For Plato and Aristotle slave economy was the final and absolute limitation; with Hegel it was bourgeois society. In dialectical materialism, however, or from the viewpoint of the working class, class society is not in itself ultimate or final; it is by no means the absolute limit of social development. It is itself subject to dialectical development and is part of the stream of social evolution. The generalized and at the same time materialistic form of dialectics is a natural result of the generalization of this point of view. Incidentally, bourgeois scholars have of late again turned to dialectics. In one form or another Hegel's dialectics has been revived in Germany. In France the philosopher Bergson has developed a peculiar form of dialectics. However, this bourgeois form of dialectics, as it has reappeared in recent years, is idealistic throughout; or, as in the case of Bergson, it is an idealistic dialectics which at the same time reverts to the first stage of dialectics, i.e., to the point of view of Heraclitus.

Dialectics may be characterized as the science which treats of the general relations in nature, in history, and in thought. The opposite of dialectics is the isolated consideration of things, and the consideration of things only in their fixity. Dialectics, on the contrary, considers all things in their most general relations, in their mutual relations of dependency, not in their fixity but in their development. The question might be raised: How do we know of this mysterious science of dialectics? Whence do we procure this wisdom? There are three sources from which dialectics has been derived. The first source is nature, the observation of natural processes. This is how Heraclitus first came upon the idea of dialectics. The second source is the observation of human history, of changes which occur from one historical period to another, changes in the mode of production, in the forms of society, and in the social ideologies associated with them. This is the second source. The third source is the examination of human thought itself. And here a further question is raised: what is the guarantee that the laws of dialectical thought that we find in our minds correspond to the laws of reality, to the laws of change in nature and in history? This correspondence is not particularly remarkable, for man, after all, is only a part of nature. Human thought is in the last analysis a natural process, of the same kind as any other process in nature. That human thought corresponds to the laws of nature and history is, therefore, not astonishing. Rather, one could say that the opposite would be inconceivable.

I cannot, of course, develop all the details of dialectics in a work of this scope. What I propose to do is to develop its fundamental laws. I shall give several examples as a basis of elucidation. Further, I shall point out the inner relation of these fundamental laws of dialectics. If these things are a bit difficult, it must be realized that they can only be understood through repeated study. Yet you will find that they are not incomprehensible secrets, that ultimately anyone can grasp them because everyone has the proof of dialectics in his daily experience as well as in his own mind. In this respect human thought is exactly the same in all minds.

The most general and the most inclusive fundamental law of dialectics from which all others are deduced is the law of the permeation of opposites. This law has a two-fold meaning: first, that all things, all processes, all concepts merge in the last analysis into an absolute unity, or, in other words, that there are no opposites, no differences which cannot ultimately be comprehended into a unity. Second, and just as unconditionally valid, that all things are at the same time absolutely different and absolutely or unqualifiedly opposed. This law may also be referred to as the law of the polar unity of opposites. This law applies to every single thing, to every single phenomenon, and to the world as a whole. Viewing thought and its method alone, it can also be put this way:

The human mind is capable of infinite condensation of things into unities, even the sharpest contradictions and opposites, and, on the other hand, it is capable of infinite differentiation and analysis of things into opposites. The human mind can establish this unlimited unity and unlimited differentiation because this unlimited unity and differentiation is present in reality.

A few examples will make this universal law clearer. Take the example of night and day. There is the twelve-hour day and the twelve-hour night, a period of light and a period of darkness. Day and night are opposites; they are mutually exclusive. This, however, does not prevent their being, at the same time, parts of a 24-hour day. Take another example: male and female. These particular opposites played a decisive rule in ancient Chinese philosophy. The opposition between male and female was made the fundamental law of the philosophy of Yih-king or _Book of Transformations._ Male and female are opposites. But this does not prevent man and woman from being identical, from coinciding as forms of the more general concept, mankind. Insofar as they both are forms of mankind they are completely identical. Take other opposites, opposites in nature such as rest and motion. Common sense regards rest and motion as absolutely different processes. Whatever rests, rests, and whatever moves, moves. The physicist, however, conceives of rest merely as a special kind of motion and vice versa. He can look upon every motion as a kind of rest. Those who are acquainted with modern physics will have a better comprehension of these things. Let us consider another opposition which appears to be absolute: it is customary to oppose art and nature. As opposed to the creations of nature, art is a creation of man. Art, however, is also a part of nature, since the man who produces art is himself nothing but a part of nature. These examples could be multiplied indefinitely, and their implications are much more far-reaching than these simple examples indicate. I cite these, however, so that you will have as clear a conception as possible of this law.

Where only simple objects of direct perception are involved, and where strong social interests are not involved, this conception which asserts the identity of opposites will usually meet with no difficulties. Obstacles to this conception present themselves when social interests oppose it or when it is no longer a question of ideas or concepts closely related to direct sense perception but of general concepts far removed from sense perception. Here too I will give a few examples. It is very easy for us to realize today that the slave as well as the slave-owner is a human being, although socially they are the most extreme opposites conceivable. But if you had told a Greek, even the most intelligent, that the slave and the slave-owner were alike as human beings, he would not have accepted it under any circumstances and would have answered that they were absolutely opposed to each other and that there could be no identity between them. Or take a modern instance, the capitalist and the proletarian, the employer and the worker. Every bourgeois will take for granted that the capitalist and the proletarian are opposed. In fact, he will maintain that this opposition has always existed and will always exist, and that it cannot be bridged. In order to understand that thisopposition is historical and transitory, one must have the the point of view of the the revolutionary working class. Or take another matter which is closer to you: we spoke before of man and woman. Everyone will admit that man and woman, from the point of view of natural science, are members of the same species, that man and woman are homogeneous, human in the same way. But as soon as I come to the social realm, contradictions immediately arise. A whole series of major historical revolutions would be necessary for mankind to conceive and apply the idea that woman should have the same human rights that man has. I don't have to tell you that in a great many countries of the Orient practical recognition of the equality between man and woman has not yet been realized. In all these cases a person who has not learned to think dialectically and who is moved by particular interests will maintain that these opposites are absolute. Only a person trained in dialectics will perceive the permeation of opposites. Of course, this does not depend only upon training in dialectics, but also upon the class viewpoint, the social viewpoint which the individual adopts. I should like to consider one more question which belongs in the same field. You know that in the United States a social distinction is made between white and colored people, and in Europe between the European, who is supposed to represent a higher class, and the colored, black and yellow races. To comprehend, both theoretically and practically, that these are not absolute opposites but that they are united in the concept of mankind which is shared equally by the white, the black, and the yellow - to comprehend this requires not only a dialectically-trained mind, but also a definite class viewpoint. The untrained mind, however, is confronted with peculiar difficulties when general concepts are in question, difficulties which increase the more abstract, the more obscure, and the farther removed these concepts are from sense perception. That both day and night are parts of the twenty-four-hour day is easily understood. But it is more difficult with such opposites as true and false, and still more difficult with the concepts of being and non-being, which are the most general of all, the most inclusive, and, at the same time, the poorest in content. The average person will say: how can one unite such absolute opposites as being and non-being? Either a thing is or it is not. There can be no bridge or common ground between them. In the treatment of Heraclitus I have already shown how the concepts of being and non-being actually permeate each other in everything that changes, how they are contained in changing things at the same time and in the same way; for a thing which is developing is something and at the same time is not that something. For example: a child which is developing into a man is a child and at the same time not a child. So far as it is becoming a man, it ceases to be a child. But it is not yet a man, because it has not yet developed into a man. The concept of becoming contains the concepts of being and non-being. In this concept they permeate each other. Or let us take another example which I have already given, the example of ordinary locomotion, i.e., when a body moves from one place to another. While it is moving it is at a certain place, and at the same time it is not at this place. I will take a third opposition, a great stumbling-block for common sense, the opposition of material and mental, of materiality and thought, or of materiality and consciousness. The average untutored mind believes that these two opposites have nothing in common. The material is not mental, and the mental is not material, and that is that. We have already demonstrated how both become a unity; how thought, the mental, is a material activity and is therefore bound to the material.

Now I will show you the obverse side of the medal, the other aspect of the proposition of the permeation of opposites. We said at the outset that there were no opposites which could not be united, no opposites between which there was no identity. Now we maintain at the same time that there are no two things between which there is not some difference, some opposition. In other words: the opposition of things is just as unlimited as their identity. To make this clearer I will tell you a little anecdote taken from the history of philosophy. German philosopher, Leibnitz, who lived at the end of the seventeenth and during the first half of the eighteenth century, formulated the proposition that there are no two things which are not different. One day he was out walking with a group of courtiers. The conversation turned upon this proposition and someone proposed to see whether or not there were two identical leaves on a certain tree standing by the wayside. The ladies and gentlemen of the court examined the tree and, of course, could not find two leaves which were perfectly identical. It is in the nature of things as well as in the nature of mind that no two things exist which do not differ. The same can be said of two rain drops. One will never be exactly like the other. Or take the smallest components of matter: two electrons which form parts of an atomic system can never be absolutely identical. We can say this with certainty even though we are not yet in a position to know anything about the individual peculiarities of electrons. (As far as atoms and molecules are concerned, we can at least determine differences in kind.) This is based on the proposition of the permeation of opposites, the proposition which says that the identity of things is just as unlimited as their difference. The capacity of the mind infinitely to equate things as well as to differentiate and oppose, corresponds to the infinite identity and difference of things in nature. This is primary. You will also find the same thing if you compare all the most general concepts, such as being and non-being, materiality and thought, etc. We have previously shown that being and non-being exist simultaneously in becoming, that they constitute identical elements of becoming. But this does not preclude their being opposites at the same time, i.e., being and non-being are different.

This law of the permeation of opposites will probably be new to you, something to which you have not previously given thought. Upon closer examination you will discover that you cannot utter a single meaningful sentence which does not comprehend this proposition. Except for sentences such as, "A lion is a lion," where the subject and predicate are identical, a meaningless sentence, this proposition can be found everywhere. Let us take a rather common sentence: "The lion is a beast of prey." A thing, A, the lion, is equated with a thing B. At the same time a distinction is made between A and B. So far as the lion is a beast of prey, it is equated with all beasts of that kind. At the same time, in the same sentence, it is distinguished from the kind. It is impossible to utter a sentence which will not contain the formula, A equals B. All meaningful sentences have a form which is conditioned by the permeation of opposites. This contradiction contained in every meaningful sentence, the equation and at the same time the differentiation between subject and predicate, had already been noticed by the so-called "sophists" of the classic period of Chinese philosophy when they argued whether or not "white horse" was really a horse.

Now our question is: what is the origin of this basic law? And this is the answer: in the first place, it is a generalization of experience. In daily life and in science we constantly have to search for the identities as well as the differences of things, and experience shows that there are no rigid, fixed limits to the discovery of either. Existing limits are mobile, relative, and temporary; they are constantly being broken, reset, and rebroken.

Secondly, this law of the permeation of opposites may be deduced from the examination of thought itself. It is a law of thought as well as of nature. In thought this law is inherent in the basis of consciousness, and this basis consists in the fact that I know that I am a part of the universe, a part of being, and, on the other hand, in the fact that I know myself to be distinct from the external world, distinct from other things. The basic structure of thought is, from the very beginning, a polar unity of opposites, and from this all other laws of thought are derived. Furthermore, this polar unity of thought corresponds to the nature of all things

DIALECTICAL LOGIC  
Part One - From the History of Dialectics

### 5: Hegel –  
Dialectics as Logic

---

  

Hegel’s solution of the problem of the subject matter of logic has played a special role in the history of this science. In order to understand the Hegelian logic it is not enough just to clarify the direct sense of its propositions. It is more important and difficult to consider the real subject matter through the fanciful turns of Hegel’s style. It is about this that we shall now speak, which will also give us a chance to understand Hegel critically, and to restore for ourselves an image of the original from its distorted presentation. Learning to read Hegel in a materialist way, as Lenin read him and advised reading him, means learning to compare his representation of the object critically with the _**object itself**_, at every step tracing the divergence between the copy and the original.

It would be an easy task if the reader had the two objects of this comparison - the copy and the original - ready-made before him. The copy exists. But where is the original? We cannot take the existing logical consciousness of the scientist as the original, for this consciousness itself must be tested for its logicality, and itself presupposes a critical analysis of existing logical forms from the standpoint of their correspondence with the real requirements of the development of science. And for an understanding of the real forms and laws of theoretical cognition Hegel’s _Science of Logic_, despite all its faults associated with idealism, can offer more than the ‘logic of science’.

The true logic of science is not given to us directly; it still has to be dug out and understood, and then converted into a consciously applied instrument for working with concepts, into a logical method of resolving problems that do not admit of solution by traditional logical methods. That being so, critical study of the _Science of Logic_ cannot be reduced to a simple comparison of its propositions with those of the logic by which scientists are consciously guided, accepting it as irreproachable and admitting of no doubts.

So comparing the copy (the science of logic) with the original (with the actual forms and laws of theoretical understanding) proves to be quite a difficult matter. The difficulty is that Hegel’s presentation of the subject matter (in this case thought) has to be compared critically not with a ready-made, previously known prototype of it, but with an object whose outlines are only beginning to be traced out for the first time in the course of a critical surmounting of the idealist constructions. This reconstruction is feasible if the structure of the optics through which Hegel examined the object of his investigation is clearly understood. This distorting lens, while a magnifying one (the system of the fundamental principles of Hegelian logic) enabled him to see exactly, although in an idealistically distorted form, the _**dialectic**_ of thought, which is the logic that remains invisible to the eye not philosophically equipped, and to simple common sense.

It is important, first of all, to understand clearly what the _**real object**_ was that Hegel investigated and described in his _Science of Logic_, so as to find the critical range immediately in regard to his presentation. ‘That the subject matter of logic is thought, with that everyone agrees,’ Hegel stressed in his [_Shorter Logic_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL2). Later, quite naturally, logic as a science received the definition of _**thinking about thought**_ or thought thinking about itself.

In that definition and the conceptions expressed by it there is still nothing either of the specifically Hegelian or of the specifically idealist. It is simply the traditional ideas of the subject matter of logic as a science, quite clearly and succinctly expressed. In logic the object of scientific comprehension proves to be thought itself, while any other science is thinking about something else. In defining logic as thinking about thought, Hegel quite accurately indicated its sole difference from any other science.

The next question, however, arises from that and requires a no less clear answer. _**But what is thought?**_ It goes without saying, Hegel replied (and one again has to agree with him), that the sole satisfactory answer can only be an exposition of the heart of the matter, i.e. a concretely developed theory, a _**science of thought**_, a ‘science of logic’, and not an ordinary definition. (Compare Engels’ view in _Anti-Duhring_: ‘Our definition of life is naturally very inadequate.... All definitions are of little value. In order to gain an exhaustive knowledge of what life is, we should have to go through all the forms in which it appears, from the lowest to the highest.’ And later: ‘To science definitions are worthless because always inadequate. The only real definition is the development of the thing itself, but this is no longer a definition.’

In any science, however, and therefore in logic too, one has to mark everything out in advance and outline its contours, if only the most general boundaries of the object of investigation, i.e. to indicate the field of the facts to which the given science must devote its attention. Otherwise the criterion for their selection will be unclear and its role will be tyrannous and arbitrary, taking only those facts into consideration that confirm its generalisations, and ignoring everything else as allegedly having no relation to the matter or to the competence of the science concerned. Hegel gave such a _**preliminary**_ explanation, not concealing from the reader exactly what he understood by the word ‘thought’.

This is a very important point, and everything else hangs on proper understanding of it. It is no accident that the main objections to Hegel, both justified and unjustified, have hitherto been directed precisely at it. Neopositivists, for example, unanimously reproach Hegel with having inadmissibly broadened the subject matter of logic by his conception of thought, including in the sphere of examination a mass of ‘things’ that one cannot call thought in the usual and strict sense; above all the concepts traditionally referred to metaphysics, and to ‘ontology’, i.e. to the science of things themselves, the system of categories (the universal definitions of reality outside consciousness, outside subjective thinking understood as the psychic capability of man).

If thinking were to be so understood, the Neopositivist reproach must really be considered reasonable. Hegel actually understood as thought something at first glance enigmatic, even mystical, when he spoke of it as taking place outside man and apart from man, independently of his head, and of ‘thought as such’, of ‘pure thought’, and when he considered the object of logic to be precisely that ‘absolute’ superhuman thought. Logic in his definition must be understood even as having a content that ‘[_**shows forth God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of Nature and of a Finite Spirit**_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlintro.htm#HL1_50)’.

Such definitions are capable of confusing and disorienting at the very start. But of course there is no such ‘thought’ as some superhuman force creating nature, and history, and man himself and his consciousness from itself somewhere in the Universe. But is Hegel’s logic then the presentation of a non-existent subject? Of an invented, purely fantastic object? In that case, how are we to rethink his constructions critically? With what, with what real object, must we compare and contrast his strings of theoretical determinations in order to distinguish the truth in them from the fallacy? With the real thinking of man? But Hegel would reply that in his _Science of Logic_ it is a matter of quite _**another**_ object, and that if empirically observed human thought is not like it, that is no argument against _**his**_ logic, for criticism of a theory only makes sense when the theory is compared with the same object as it represents, and not with another one; and it is impossible to compare logic with the acts of thinking actually taking place in people’s heads because people think very _**illogically**_ at every step, even elementarily illogically, let alone according to a logic of a much higher order, of the kind that Hegel had in mind.

When you point out to a logician, therefore, that man’s real thinking does not occur as it is depicted in his theory, he could reasonably reply that it was so much the worse _**for this thinking**_ and that the theory did not need to be adapted to the empirical but that real thought must be made logical and brought into harmony with logical principles.

For logic as a science, however, a fundamental difficulty arises here. If it were only permissible to compare logical principles with logical thought, did that then not wipe out any possibility whatsoever of checking whether or not they were _**correct**_? It is quite understandable that these principles would always be in agreement with thoughts that had previously been made to agree with them. After all, it only meant that logical principles agreed with themselves, with their own embodiment in empirical acts of thought. In that case, a very ticklish situation was created for theory. Logic had in mind only logically immaculate thinking, and logically incorrect thinking was not an argument against its schemas. But it consented to consider only such thinking as logically immaculate as exactly confirmed its own ideas about thought, and evaluated any deviation from its rules as a fact falling outside its subject matter and therefore to be considered solely as a ‘mistake’ needing to be ‘corrected’.

In any other science such a claim would evoke consternation. What kind of a theory was it that consented to take into account only such facts as confirmed it, and did not wish to consider contradictory facts, although there must be millions and billions such? But surely that was exactly the traditional position of logic, which was presented by its devotees as standing to reason, and which made logic absolutely unself-critical on the one hand and incapable of development on the other.

That, incidentally, was where Kant’s illusion originated, the illusion that logic as a theory had long ago acquired a fully closed, completed character and not only was not in need of development of its propositions but could not be by its very nature. Schelling also understood Kant’s logic as an absolutely precise presentation of the principles and rules of thinking in concepts.

Hegel had doubts about the proposition that it was the rules of logic that prevented understanding of the process of the passage of the concept into the object and vice versa, of the subjective into the objective (and in general of opposites into one another). He saw in it not evidence of the organic deficiency of thought but only the limitations of Kant’s ideas about it. Kantian logic was only a limitedly true theory of thought. Real thought, the real subject matter of logic as a science, as a matter of fact was something else; therefore it was necessary to bring the theory of thought into agreement with its real subject matter.

Hegel saw the need for a critical reconsideration of traditional logic primarily in the extreme, glaring discrepancy between the principles and rules that Kant considered absolutely universal forms of thought and the real results that had been achieved by human civilisation in the course of its development. ‘ [A comparison of the forms to which Spirit has risen in the worlds of Practice and Religion, and of Science in every department of knowledge Positive and Speculative - a comparison of these with the form which Logic, that is, Spirit’s knowledge of its own pure essence - has attained, shows such a glaring discrepancy that it cannot fail to strike the most superficial observer that the latter is inadequate to the lofty development of the former, and unworthy of it.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlintro.htm#HL1_51a)’

Thus the existing logical theories did not correspond to the real _**practice of thought**_, and _**thinking about thought**_ (i.e. logic) consequently lagged behind _**thinking about everything else**_, behind the thinking that was realised as the science of the external world, as consciousness fixed in the form of knowledge and things created by the power of knowledge, in the form of the whole organism of civilisation. In functioning as _**thinking about the world**_, thought had achieved such success that beside it _**thinking about thought**_ proved to be something quite incommensurable, wretched, deficient, and poor. To take it on faith that human thought had really been and was guided by the rules, laws, and principles that in the aggregate constituted traditional logic was to make all the progress of science and practice simply inexplicable.

Hence there arose the paradox that the human intellect, which had created modern culture, had come to a standstill in amazement before its own creation. Schelling had also expressed this amazement of the ‘spirit’, and it was just at this point that Hegel began to differ with him.

Hegel considered that the rules by which the ‘spirit’ was actually guided, contrary to the illusions that it had created on its own account (in the person of professional logicians) and had set out in the form of textbooks of logic, could and must be brought out and set forth in the _**form of a concept**_, quite rationally, without shifting everything hitherto not comprehended onto ‘intuition’, i.e. onto an ability that was from the very outset something quite different from thought. Hegel’s posing of the matter played a special role because it, for the first time, subjected all the main concepts of logical science, above all the concept of _**thought**_, to careful analysis.

At first glance (and people usually proceed from such a ‘first glance’, adopting it absolutely uncritically from everyday usage), thought represented one of man’s subjective psychic abilities along with others like intuition, sensation, memory, will, and so on and so forth. By thinking was also understood a special kind of _**activity**_ directed, unlike practice, at altering ideas, at reorganising the images that were in the individual’s _**consciousness**_, and directly at the verbal shaping of these ideas in speech; ideas, when expressed in speech (words, terms) were called concepts. When man altered real things outside his head, and not ideas, that was no longer considered thinking, but at best only activities _**in accordance with thought**_, according to the laws and rules dictated by it.

Thought was thus identified with _**reflection**_, i.e. with psychic activity in the course of which a person gave himself an account of what he was doing, and how, and became aware of all the schemas and rules by which he acted. The sole job of logic then proved, quite understandably, to be simply the ordering and classifying of the corresponding schemas and rules. Every individual could discover them for himself in his own _**consciousness**_ because, even without any study of logic, he was guided by them (only not, perhaps, systematically). As Hegel justly put it, ‘[such logic had no other business than could be done through the activity of simple formal thought, and so it certainly produced nothing that one could not otherwise have done just as well](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlintro.htm#HL1_58)’.

Everything we have said also applied fully to Kant, which is why Hegel said that ‘the Kantian philosophy could not have any effect on the treatment of the sciences. _**It left the categories and methods of ordinary knowledge quite undisturbed**_’. It only introduced order into the schemas of existing consciousness, only built them into a system (in so doing, true, it came up against the facts of a mutual contradiction between the various schemas). So the Kantian logic appeared as a kind of honest confession of existing consciousness, of its systematically expounded self-consciousness, and nothing more; or rather, of its _**conceits**_ - an exposition of what existing thought thought of itself. But just as it was a blunder to judge a person according to what and how he thought of himself, so it was impossible to judge thinking by its self-opinion; it was much more useful to examine what it was really doing, and how, possibly even without giving itself a proper evaluation of it.

Having thus posed the problem Hegel proved to be the first professional logician who resolutely and consciously threw aside the old prejudice that thought was presented to the investigator only in the form of speech (external or internal, oral or written). The prejudice was not accidental; thought could only look at itself from the side, as it were, as an object different from itself, only insofar as it had expressed itself, embodied itself in some external form. And the completely conscious thought that all the old logic had in view really assumed language, speech, the word, as its outward form of expression. In other words thought achieved _**awareness**_ of the schemas of its own activity precisely through and in language. (This circumstance had in fact been recorded in the very name of logic, which is derived from the Greek _logos_, word.) Not only Hegel and the Hegelians, incidentally, spoke of this, but also some of their opponents in principle, like Trendelenburg, who noted that traditional (formal) ‘logic becomes conscious of itself in speech and so in many respects is a grammar absorbed with itself’.

Let us note in passing that all schools of logic, without exception, having ignored Hegel’s criticism of the old logic have shared this old prejudice to this day as though nothing had happened. It is most outspokenly professed by Neopositivists, who directly identify thought with linguistic activity and logic with the analysis of language. The most striking thing about this is the self-conceit with which they project this archaic prejudice as the latest discovery of twentieth century logical thinking, as the manifestation to the world at long last of the principle of the scientific development of logic, as an axiom of the ‘logic of science’.

Language (speech) is, nevertheless, not the sole empirically observed form in which human thought manifests itself. Does man really not discover himself as a _**thinking**_ being in his actions, in the course of actually shaping the world around him, in the making of things? Does he really only function as a thinking being when talking? The question is surely purely rhetorical. The thought of which Hegel spoke discloses itself in human _**affairs**_ every bit as obviously as in words, in chains of terms, in the lacework of word combinations. Furthermore, in real affairs man demonstrates the real modes of his thinking more adequately than in his narrations of them.

But, that being so, man’s _**actions**_, and so too the results of his actions, the things created by them, not only could, but must, be considered _**manifestations of his thought**_, as acts of the objectifying of his ideas, thoughts, plans, and conscious intentions. Hegel demanded from the very start that thought should be investigated _**in all the forms**_ in which it was realised, and above all in human affairs, in the creation of things and events. Thought revealed its force and real power not solely in talking but also in the whole grandiose process of creating culture and the whole objective body of civilisation, the whole ‘inorganic body of man’ (Marx), including in that tools and statues, workshops and temples, factories and chancelleries, political organisations and systems of legislation.

It was on that basis that Hegel also acquired the right to consider in logic the objective determinations of things outside consciousness, _**outside the psyche of the human individual**_, in all their independence, moreover, from that psyche. There was nothing mystical nor idealist in that; it meant the forms (‘determinations’) of things created by the activity of the thinking individual. In other words, the forms of his thought embodied in natural materials, ‘invested’ in it by human activity. Thus a house appeared as the architect’s conception embodied in stone, a machine as the embodiment of the engineer’s ideas in metal, and so on; and the whole immense objective body of civilisation as thought in its ‘otherness’ (_das Idee in der Form des Anderssein_), in its sensual objective embodiment. The whole history of humanity was correspondingly also to be considered a process of the ‘outward revelation’ of the power of thought, as a process of the realisation of man’s ideas, concepts, notions, plans, intentions, and purposes, _**as a process of the embodying of logic**_, i.e. of the schemas to which men’s purposive activity was subordinated.

The understanding and careful analysis of thought in this aspect (investigation of the ‘active side’ as Marx called it in his first thesis on Feuerbach) was still not idealism. Logic, furthermore, by following such a path, thus took the decisive step toward genuine (‘intelligent’) materialism, toward understanding of the fact that all logical forms without exception were universal forms of the development of reality outside thought, reflected in human consciousness and tested in the course of millennia of practice. In considering thought in the course of its materialisation as well as in its verbal revelation Hegel did not go beyond the bounds of the analysis of _**thought**_ at all, beyond the limits of the subject matter of logic as a special science. He simply brought into the field of view of logic that real phase of the process of development of thought without understanding which logic could not and never would be able to become a real science.

From Hegel’s standpoint the real basis for the forms and laws of thought proved to be only the aggregate historical process of the _**intellectual development of humanity**_ understood in its universal and necessary aspects. The subject matter of logic was no longer the abstract identical schemas that could be found in each individual consciousness, and common to each of them, but the _**history of science and technique**_ collectively created by people, a process quite independent of the will and consciousness of the separate individuals although realised at each of its stages precisely in the conscious activity of individuals. This process, according to Hegel, also included, as a phase, the act of realising thought in object activity, and through activity in the forms of things and events outside consciousness. In that, in Lenin’s words, he ‘came very close to materialism’.

In considering thought as a real productive process expressing itself not only in the movement of words but also in the changing of things, Hegel was able, for the first time in the history of logic, to pose the problem of a special analysis of thought-forms, or the analysis of thought from the aspect of form. Before him such an aim had not arisen in logic, and even could not have. ‘It is hardly surprising that economists, wholly under the influence of material interests, have overlooked the formal side of the relative expression of value, when professional logicians, before Hegel, even overlooked the formal aspect of the propositions and conclusions they used as examples.’

Logicians before Hegel had recorded only the external schemas in which logical actions, judgments and inferences functioned _**in speech**_, i.e. as schemas of the joining together of terms signifying general ideas, but the logical form expressed in these figures, i.e. the category, remained outside their sphere of investigation, and the conception of it was simply borrowed from metaphysics and ontology. So it had been even with Kant, despite the fact that he had nevertheless seen categories precisely as the _**principles of judgments**_ (with objective significance, in his sense).

And since logical form, about which Marx spoke in the first edition of _Das Kapital_, was understood as a form of activity realised equally well in the movement of verbal terms and in the movement of the things involved in the work of the thinking being, there then for the first time only, arose the possibility of analysing it specially as such, of abstracting it from the special features of its expression in some partial material or other (including those which were linked with the specific features of its realisation in the fabric of language).

In _logos_, in reason, _Sage und Sache_, i.e. myth and fact, or rather legend and true story, were equally expressed in the logical aspect (in contrast to the psychological-phenomenological). (Incidentally, play on words, for example, was very characteristic of Hegel, puns however that threw light on the genetic relationship of the ideas expressed by the words. _Sage_ is legend, myth, hence ‘saga’, a legend of high deeds (cf. _bylina_, the form of Russian epic); _Sache_ is a broad capacious word signifying not so much a single, sensuously perceived thing, as the essence of the matter, situation, the point, the actual state of affairs (or things), i.e. everything that is or was in the matter itself (cf. Russian _byl’_, meaning a true story, fact, what really happened). This etymology is used in the _Science of Logic_ to express very important shades of meaning, which sound as follows in [Lenin’s translation and materialist interpretation](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_92d1): ‘"With this introduction of Content into logical consideration", the subject becomes not _Dinge_ but _die Sache_, _der Begriff der Dinge_ [i.e. not things, but the essence, the concept of things], not things but the laws of their movement, materialistically."

Considered as the activity of the thinking being in its universal form, thought was also fixed in those of its schemas and moments as remained _**invariant**_ in whatever special material the relevant activity was performed and whatever product it put out at any one instant. In the Hegelian view it was quite irrelevant how, precisely, the action of thinking took place or takes place, whether in articulated vibrations of the ambient air and their identifying signs or in some other natural, physical substance. ‘[In all human contemplation there is thought, just as thought is the general in all conceptions, recollections, and on the whole any mental activity, in all wishes, desires, etc. All these are only further specifications of thought. While we so conceive thought, it itself appears in another aspect than when we only speak; we have intellectual power over and above any other abilities, like contemplation, imagination, will and the like.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL21)’

All the universal schemas being depicted in the activity of the thinking being, including that directed toward immediately intuited or represented material, must therefore be considered not less as _**logical**_ parameters of thought than the schemas of its expression in language, or in the form of the figures known in the old logic. Thought in the broadest sense of the word, as activity altering images of the external world in general expressed in words (and not the words in themselves), the thought that really ‘[effects everything human and makes humanity human](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL2_2)’, as a capacity that creates knowledge in any forms, including that of the contemplated images, and ‘penetrates’ into them, and hence not simply the subjective, psychic act of using or treating words, was the subject matter of logic, the science of thought.

Thought, in fact, included the human ‘[_**determination**_ of sensation, intuition, images, ideas, aims, obligations, etc., and also thoughts and concepts](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL3)’ (‘thoughts and concepts’ here have the meaning of the old, purely formal logic). Thought in general thus ‘[_**appears**_ at first not in the form of thought but as feeling, intuition, imagination - _**forms**_ that are to be distinguished from thought as form](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL2_3)’. The thought-form as such appears to us only in the _**course of thinking about thought itself**_, i.e. only in logic.

But before man began to think about _**thought**_, he had already _**to think**_, though still not realising the logical schemas and categories within which this thinking took place, but already embodying them in the form of the concrete statements and concepts of science, engineering, morals, and so on. Thought was thus realised at first as activity in all the diversity of its outward manifestations. The thought-form here was ‘sunk’ into the material of concrete thoughts, sense images, and ideas, was ‘sublated’ in them, and was therefore counterposed to conscious thinking as the form of external reality. In other words, thought and the thought-form did not appear at first to the thinking being as forms of his own activity at all (of his ‘self’ - _das Selbst_), creating a certain product, but as forms of the _**product itself**_, i.e. of concrete knowledge, images and concepts, intuition and representation, as the forms of tools, machines, states, etc., etc., and as the forms of realised aims, wishes, desires, and so on.

Thought could not ‘see’ itself otherwise than in the mirror of its own creations, in the mirror of the external world, _**which we knew through thought-activity**_. Thought, as it appeared in logic, was thus the same thought as had been realised in the form of knowledge of the world, in the form of science, engineering, art, and morality. But it was far from the same thing _**in form**_, because ‘there is a difference between having sensations and ideas, determined and _**penetrated by thought**_, and having _**thoughts about them**_’.

Neglect of this very important distinction led the old logic into a dual error. On the one hand it only defined thought as ‘a subjective, psychic capability of the individual’ and therefore counterposed to thought so understood the whole sphere of ‘intuition, ideas, and will’ as something existing outside thought and having nothing in common with it, as the object of reflection existing outside thought. On the other hand, in not distinguishing _**in form**_ between the relative strength of the two revelations of thought mentioned above, it could also not say how the _**thought-form**_ as such (‘in and for itself’) was differentiated from the form of intuition and representation, in the shape of which it had originally appeared and was hidden, and consequently confused the one with the other, taking the form of the concept for the form of intuition, and vice versa.

Hence, too, it came about that, under the form of _**concept**_, the old logic considered every kind of _**idea**_ or _**notion**_ whatsoever, insofar as it was expressed in speech or in a term, that is to say, the image of intuition or contemplation held in consciousness by means of speech, which recorded it. As a result, too, the old logic embraced the concept itself only from the aspect from which it was really not distinguished in any way from any notion or intuitive image expressed in speech, from the aspect of the abstract and general, which was really just as common to the concept as to the notion. Thus it came about that it took the form of _**abstract identity**_ or _**abstract universality**_ for the specific form of the concept, and could therefore only raise the law of identity and the principle of contradiction in determinations to the rank of absolute, fundamental criteria of the thought-form in general.

Kant also took that stand, understanding by concept _**any general notion**_ insofar as it was fixed by a term. Hence his definition: ‘The concept is... a general image or representation of that which is common to many objects, consequently a general idea, _**provided that it can be included in several objects**_.’

Hegel himself required a more profound solution of the _**problem of the concept and of thinking in concepts**_ from logic. For him a concept was primarily a synonym for real _**understanding**_ of the essence of the matter and not simply an expression of something general, of some identity of the objects of intuition. A concept disclosed the real nature of a thing and not its similarity with other things; and not only should it express the abstract generality of its object (that was only one of the moments of a concept, relating it to notion), but also the _**special nature**_ or peculiarity of the object. That was why the form of the concept proved to be a dialectical unity of universality and particularity, a unity that was also _**revealed**_ through manifold forms of judgment and inference, and came out into the open in judgments. It was not surprising that any judgment destroyed the form of abstract identity and represented its self-evident _**negation**_. Its form was: A is B (i.e. not-A).

Hegel distinguished clearly between universality, which dialectically contained the whole richness of the particular and the singular within itself and in its determinations, and the simple abstract generality, identicalness, of all the single objects of a given kind. The universal _**concept**_ expressed itself the _**actual law**_ of the origin, development, and fading or disappearance of single things. And that was already quite another angle on the concept, much truer and deeper, because, as Hegel demonstrated with a mass of examples, the real law (the immanent nature of the single thing) did not always appear on the surface of phenomena in the form of a simple identicalness, of a common sign or attribute, or in the form of identity. If that were so there would be no need for any theoretical science. The job of thought was not limited to empirically registering common attributes. The central concept of Hegel’s logic was therefore the _**concrete-universal**_: he brilliantly illustrated its distinction from the simple, abstract universality of the sphere of notions in his famous pamphlet _Wer denkt abstrakt?_ (_Who thinks abstractly?_). To think abstractly meant to be enslaved by the force of current catchphrases and clichés, of one-sided, empty definitions; meant to see in real, sensuously intuited things only an insignificant part of their real content, only such determinations of them as were already ‘jelled’ in consciousness and functioned there as ready-made stereotypes. Hence the ‘magic force’ of current catchphrases and expressions, which fence reality off from the thinking person instead of serving as the form of its expression.

In this last interpretation logic finally became a real logic of understanding of _**unity in variety**_, and not a scheme for manipulating readymade ideas and notions; a logic of critical and self-critical thought and not a means of the uncritical classification and pedantic, schematic presentation of existing ideas.

From premises of that kind Hegel concluded that real thought in fact took other forms and was governed by other laws than those that current logic considered the sole determinations of thinking. Thought had obviously to be investigated as collective, co-operative activity in the course of which the individual, with his schemas of conscious thinking, performed only partial functions. In fulfilling them, however, he was constantly forced at the same time to perform actions that would not fit in, in any way, with the schemas of ordinary logic. In really taking part in common work he was all the time subordinating himself to the laws and forms of _**universal thought**_, though not conscious of them as such. Hence the ‘topsy-turvy’ situation arose in which the real forms and laws of thought were expressed and understood as some kind of _**external necessity**_, as an _**extra-logical**_ determination of the action; and on the sole ground that they were still not revealed and realised by logic, not acknowledged as logical interpretations.

As can easily be seen, Hegel criticised traditional logic, and the thinking appropriate to it, by the same ‘immanent procedure’ that was one of his main conquests, namely, he counterposed to the assertions, rules, and basic propositions of logic not some kind of opposing assertions, rules and basic propositions but the process of the practical realisation of its own principles in real thought. He showed it its own image, pointing out those of its features that it preferred not to notice and not to recognise. Hegel required only one thing of thinking in accordance with logic, namely uncompromising consistency in applying the principles adduced. And he showed that it was the consistent application of these principles (and not departure from them) that in fact led inevitably, with inexorable force, to _**negation**_ of the principles themselves as one-sided, incomplete, and abstract.

That was the very critique of reason, from the standpoint of reason itself, that Kant had begun; and this critique (self-criticism) of reason and its circumscribing logic led to the conclusion that ‘[the nature of thought is itself dialectics, that as understanding it must fall into the negative of itself, into contradiction. . .](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL11_1)’. Kant had actually reached a similar conclusion; and whereas before him logic could be unself-critical _**out of ignorance**_, now it could maintain its precarious position only if it quite consciously rejected facts unacceptable to it, only by becoming _**consciously unself-critical**_.

The historically unavoidable defect of Kantian logic was that it pedantically schematised and described a mode of thought that led to a bringing out and sharp formulation of the contradictions contained in any concept but did not show how they could and should be resolved _**logically**_ without shifting this difficult task onto ‘practical reason’, onto ‘moral postulates’, and other factors and abilities lying outside logic. Hegel, however, saw the main job facing logic after the work of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, as precisely in finding, bringing out, and indicating to thought, the means of intelligently and concretely resolving the contradictions into which it inevitably fell when consciously guided by the traditional, purely formal logic. That, too, was the real distinction between Hegel’s conception of thought and logic and all preceding ones.

The old logic, coming up against the logical contradiction that it itself brought to light just because it rigorously followed its own principles, always baulked at it, retreated to analysis of the preceding movement of thought, and always strove to find an error or mistake in it leading to the contradiction. For formal logical thinking contradictions thus became an insurmountable barrier to the forward movement of thought, an obstacle in the way of concrete analysis of the essence of the matter. It therefore also came about that ‘[thought, despairing of managing _**by itself**_ to resolve the contradiction into which it had got itself, turns back to the solutions and reliefs that were the spirit’s lot in its other modes and forms](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL11_1)’. It could not be otherwise, since the contradiction did not develop through a mistake. No mistake, it ultimately proved, had been made in the preceding thinking. It was necessary to go even further back, to uncomprehended contemplation, sense perception, aesthetic intuition, i.e. to the realm of lower forms of consciousness (lower, that is, in relation to conceptual thinking), where there was really no contradiction for the simple reason that it had still not been disclosed and clearly expressed. (It never hurts, of course, to go back and analyse the preceding course of argument and check whether there has not been a formal mistake, for that also happens not infrequently; and here the recommendations of formal logic have a quite rational sense and value. It may turn out, as a result of checking, that a given logical contradiction is really nothing but the result of committing an error or mistake somewhere. Hegel, of course, never dreamed of denying such a case. He, like Kant, had in mind only those antinomies that developed in thought as a result of the most formally ‘correct’ and faultless argumentation.)

Hegel also suggested that a contradiction should be resolved as well as disclosed, and resolved by the same logical thinking as had brought it out when a definite concept was being developed.

He treated both the origin and the mode of resolution of logical contradictions differently. Like Kant he understood that they did not arise at all through the negligence or carelessness of individual thinking persons but unlike Kant he understood that they could and must be resolved and must not always be preserved as antinomies. But so that it could resolve them thought must fix them sharply and clearly in advance, precisely as antinomies, as _**logical**_ contradictions, as real, and not imaginary, contradictions in determinations.

Dialectics, according to Hegel, was the form (or method or schema) of thought that included the process both of elucidating contradictions and of concretely resolving them in the corpus of a higher and more profound stage of rational understanding of the same object, on the way toward further investigation of the essence of the matter, i.e. in the course of developing science, engineering, and ‘morality’, and all the spheres he called the ‘objective spirit’.

This conception immediately brought about constructive shifts in the whole system of logic. Whereas Kant’s ‘dialectic’ was only the final, third part of logic (the doctrine on the forms of understanding and reason), where it was a matter actually of the statement of the logically unresolvable antinomies of theoretical cognition, with Hegel it appeared quite another matter. With him the sphere of the logical was divided into three main sections or aspects, i.e. three main directions were distinguished in it, as follows:

1. the abstract or rational;

2. the dialectical or negatively reasonable;

3. the speculative or positively reasonable.

Hegel specially stressed that ‘[these three aspects in no case constitute three _**parts**_ of logic, but are only _**moments of any logically real nature**_, that is of any concept or of any truth in general](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL79)’.

In the empirical history of thought (as in any given, historically achieved state of it) these three aspects appeared either as three consecutive ‘formations’ or as three different but closely related systems of logic. Hence we got the illusion that they could be depicted as three different sections (or ‘parts’) of logic, following one after the other.

Logic as a whole, however, could not be obtained by a simple uniting of these three aspects, each of which was taken in the form in which it had been developed in the history of thought. That called for critical treatment of all three aspects from the standpoint of higher principles, those historically last achieved. Hegel characterised the three ‘moments’ of logical thought that should constitute Logic as follows.

1. ‘[Thought as _**understanding**_ remains stuck in firm determination and does not get beyond differentiation of the latter; such a limited abstraction applies to it as existing and being for itself.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL80)’ The separate (isolated) historical embodiment of this ‘moment’ in thought appeared as _**dogmatism**_, and its logical, theoretical self-awareness as ‘general‘, i.e. purely formal logic.

2. ‘[The _**dialectical**_ moment is the own self-abolition of such ultimate determinations and their transition into their opposites.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL80)’ Historically this moment appears as _**scepticism**_, i.e. as the state in which thought, feeling bewildered among opposing, equally ‘logical’ and mutually provoking dogmatic systems, is powerless to choose and prefer one of them. Logical self-awareness, corresponding to the stage of scepticism, was distinguished in the Kantian conception of dialectics as a state of the insolubility of the antinomies between dogmatic systems. Scepticism (Kant’s type of ‘negative dialectic’) was higher than dogmatism both historically and in content because the dialectic included in reason or understanding was already _**realised**_, and existed not only ‘in itself’ but ‘for itself’.

3. ‘[The _**speculative or positively reasonable**_ conceives the unity of determinations in their opposition, the _**affirmation**_ that is contained in their resolution and their transition](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_divis.htm#SL82).’ Hegel also saw systematic treatment of this last ‘moment’ (and correspondingly critical rethinking of the first two from the angle of the third) as the historically pressing task in logic, and therefore his own mission and the aim of his work.

When critically rethought in the light of the principles only now elicited, the ‘moments’ considered ceased to be independent parts of logic and were transformed into three abstract aspects of one and the same logical system. Then a logic was created such that, when thinking was guided by it, thought became fully self-critical and was in no danger of falling into either the dullness of dogmatism or into the sterility of sceptical neutrality.

Hence, too, there followed the external, formal division of logic into (1) the doctrine of being,(2) the doctrine of essence, and (3) the doctrine of the notion (concept, idea).

The division of logic into the objective (the first two sections) and the subjective coincided at first glance with the old division of philosophy into ontology and logic proper; but Hegel stressed that such a division would be very inexact and arbitrary because, in logic, the opposition between the subjective and the objective (in their ordinary meaning) disappeared.

His position on this question calls besides for a thorough commentary since superficial criticism of his conception of logic and its subject matter has so far been primarily that his position _**ignored**_ the opposition (contrast) between the subjective and the objective (between thinking and being) and therefore casuistically produced specifically logical schemas of thought for the ontological determination of things outside thought and, on the contrary, universal definitions of the reality outside thought for schemas of the logical process, thus committing two sins: (a) hypostatising logical forms, and (b) logicalising reality.

If the original sin of Hegelianism had really been a simple, naive blindness in relation to the contrast between thought and reality, between the concept and its object, then Kant’s dualism would have been the apex of philosophical wisdom. In fact, however, Hegel’s ‘error’ was not so simple, and was not in the least characterised by the evaluation cited above. Hegel saw the difference and, what is more important, the contradiction (opposition) between the world of things outside consciousness and the world of thought (the world in thought, in science, in _**concepts**_), and was much more acutely aware of it than his naive critics among the Kantians; and in any case he ascribed much greater significance for logic to this opposition than, say, positivists do (who, especially in a logic, directly identify the concept and the object of the concept).

The point is quite another one; and another understanding of it follows from the specifically Hegelian conception of _**thought**_, and thus also from Hegel’s solution of the problem of the relation of thought and the world of things.

That is why, when Hegel formulated a programme for the critical transformation of logic as a science, he posed the task of bringing it (i.e. thought’s awareness of the universal schemas of its own work) into correspondence with its real object, i.e. with real thought, with its real universal forms and laws.

The last-named do not exist in thought simply or even so much as schemas and rules of _**conscious**_ thinking, but rather as universal schemas of _**objective**_ thinking that are realised not so much as a subjective psychic act as the productive process that created science, technique and morality.

In defending the objectivity of logical forms so understood, Hegel of course was right in many respects; and his critique of the subjective idealist interpretation of the logical (Hume, Kant, Fichte) is topical in the struggle against many of their present-day successors, in particular Neopositivists. As social formations science and technique (‘the materialised power of knowledge’ as Marx defined it) exist and develop of course outside the individual’s consciousness. But, according to Hegel, there was no other consciousness than that of the individual, never had been, and never would be; and the logical forms of development of science and technique really stood in opposition to the consciousness and will of the individual as quite objective limits to his individually performed actions, even as limits dictated to him _**from outside**_.

‘According to these determinations, thoughts can be called objective, and they can also be taken to include the forms that are considered for the present in ordinary logic and are looked upon only as forms of _**conscious**_ thought. Logic here coincides with _Metaphysics_, with the science of _**things**_ conceived in thought...’

In this conception of the objectivity of thought-forms there was as yet, of course, no facet of the specifically Hegelian, i.e. _**objective**_, idealism. One cannot reproach Hegel with having allegedly extended the boundaries of the subject matter of logic impermissibly so that it began to embrace not only thought but things. Hegel (and Kant, too) did not in general speak just about _**things as such**_; he had in mind exclusively things _**comprehended in thoughts**_. It was in that sense that he asserted that ‘in logic thoughts are so conceived that they have no other content than that belonging to the thought itself and produced through it’. In other words logic had in mind not things but those of _**their determinations**_ as were posited by the action of thought, i.e. _**scientific**_ determinations.

Thus, what Hegel affirmed within the limits of consideration of pure thought was much more rigorous and consistent than the logic before him; and he justly reproached it precisely for not having been able to confine itself rigorously within the bounds of its own subject matter, and for having imported into it material not assimilated by thought and not reproduced by thought-activity.

His requirement of including all the categories (the subject matter of the old metaphysics and ontology) in logic in no way meant going beyond the limits of thought. It was equivalent to a demand for a critical analysis to be made of the _**thought-activity**_ that had engendered the determinations of the old metaphysics, and for those thought-forms to be brought out that both logic and metaphysics had applied quite uncritically and unconsciously, without clearly realising what they consisted of. Hegel had no doubt that ‘thought-forms must not be used without having been subjected to investigation’ and that ‘we must make the thought-forms themselves the object of cognition’. But such an investigation was already thought, and the activity taking place in those very forms was the act of applying them. If we looked on logic as investigation (cognition) of thought-forms, he wrote, this investigation ‘must also unite the activity of thought-forms and their critique in cognition. The thought-forms must be taken in and for themselves; they are the object and the activity of the object itself; they themselves inquire into themselves, must determine their limits and demonstrate their defects themselves. That will then be that activity of thought that will soon be given separate consideration as _**dialectics**_. . .

The subject matter of logic then proved to be those really _**universal**_ forms and patterns within which the collective consciousness of humanity was realised. The course of its development, empirically realised as the history of science and technique, was also seen as that ‘whole’ to the interests of which all the individual’s separate logical acts were subordinated.

And inasmuch as the individual was involved in the common cause, in the work of _**universal**_ thought, he was continually forced to perform actions dictated ‘by the interests of the whole’ and not confined to the schemas of ‘general’ logic. He would naturally not realise his actions in logical concepts, although these acts were performed by _**his own thinking**_. The schemas (forms and laws) of universal thought would be realised unconsciously through his psyche. (Not ‘unconsciously’ in general, but without _**logical**_ consciousness of them, without their expression in logical concepts and categories.)

In this connection Hegel introduced one of his most important distinctions between thought ‘in itself’ (_an sich_), which also constituted the subject matter, the object of investigation, in logic, and thought ‘for itself’ (_für sich selbst_), i.e. thought that had already become aware of the schemas, principles, forms, and laws of its own work and had already worked quite consciously in accordance with them, fully and clearly realising what it was doing, and how it was doing it. Logic was also consciousness, the expression through concepts and categories of those laws and forms in accordance with which the process of thinking ‘in itself’ (_an sich_) took place. In logic it also became the _**object for itself**_ .

In logic thought had consequently to become the same ‘for itself’ as it had earlier been only ‘in itself’.

Hegel therefore also formulated the task of bringing logic into line with its _**real subject matter**_, with _**real thought**_, with the really universal forms and laws of development of science, technique, and morality.

In other words he wanted to make the subjective consciousness of thought about itself _**identical**_ with its object, with the real universal and necessary (objective) forms and laws of universal (and not individual) thought. That also meant that the principle of the _**identity of the subjective and the objective**_ must be introduced into logic as the highest principle, i.e. the principle that the real forms and laws of thought must be delineated in logic exactly, adequately, and correctly. The principle of the identity of subject and object signified nothing more, and did not signify any ‘hypostatisation’ of the forms of subjective thought, because one and the same thought was both object and subject in logic, and it was a matter of the agreement, coincidence, and identity of this thought (as consciously performed activity) with itself as unconsciously performed productive activity, or as activity hitherto taking place with a false consciousness of its own actions.

In defending the _**objectivity**_ of logical forms Hegel of course stood head and shoulders above (and closer to materialism) than all those who up to the present have reproached him with having ‘hypostatised’ logical forms in order to defend their version of the identity of thought and object as a purely conventional principle, as the principle of the identity of sign and thing designated, of the concept and that which is thought in it. Hegel was 100 per cent right in his critique of the subjective idealist version of the logical and of its objectivity (as merely the agreement of all thinking individuals, as merely the identity - read _**equality**_ of all the schemas by which each Ego taken separately operated). His critique not only hit at Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, but also strikes all today’s Neopositivists.

(Marx, incidentally, also defined the categories of political economy as ‘objective thought-forms’: ‘They are the socially valid, and therefore objective thought-forms....’)

Thus the statement that there was no difference for logic between the subjective and the objective did not mean anything else on Hegel’s lips than an affirmation that logic must consider, within itself, within its own theory, and link together in one system, literally _**all**_ the logical schemas of thought activity, beginning with the categories and finishing up with the figures of judgments and conclusions. And within it there must be room both for those schemas that prior to Kant were considered simply determinations of things outside consciousness and for those that were usually considered to be ‘specific’ to consciousness and had allegedly _**no**_ relation to things outside the mind.

Hegel did not dream of repudiating the differences between the categorial schemas given in the determinations of categories and the figures of formal logic, of course; but he did require them to be explained and disclosed within logic itself and not to be presumed in advance, uncritically borrowed from the old metaphysic and its corresponding logic. He required the one and the other to be included in logic in critically rethought form.

‘The relation of such forms as concept, judgment, and conclusion to other forms like causality, etc., can only be discovered within logic itself.’

Hegel thus did not include the determinations of things as they existed outside the mind or in everyday consciousness in logic at all, but solely those determinations that appeared to the mind in _**science**_, and in theoretical consciousness, that were ‘posited’ or formulated by _**thought itself**_. And since science was the realised force (faculty) of thought, materialised mental, theoretical labour, he also saw primarily ‘objectified’ _**determinations of thought**_ in the determinations of things.

The requirement of including all _**categories**_ in logic was therefore equivalent to requiring a critical analysis to be made of those _**activities**_ of thought that were materialised or objectified in the concepts of the old metaphysic, and to requiring disclosure of the _**logic of thought**_ that was earlier realised in the form of various schemas of the universe, and so to requiring a critical understanding of all the categories that the old logic had taken over quite uncritically from ontological systems.

Hegel thus did not go outside the framework of the subject matter of logic at all but only beyond the limits of the notions of earlier logicians about these limits. While remaining within the boundaries of the investigation of thought, and only of thought, he nevertheless saw more within those boundaries than previous logicians, and saw those logical (universal) schemas of developing thought that the old logic had not considered universal at all and had therefore not included in the theory. Logic thus proved to be pinned to discovery and investigation of the _**objective**_ laws governing the subjective activity of individuals, and those forms in which, whether or not the individuals so wished it, or whether or not they realised it, they were forced, insofar in general as they thought, to express the results of their subjective efforts.

That is in what Hegel saw the true difference between the real _**laws**_ of thought and the rules that the old logic had promoted to the rank of laws. Man can break rules, unlike laws, and does so at every step, thus demonstrating that they are not laws. Because laws cannot be broken, they constitute the determinateness of the object, which cannot be omitted without the object itself, in this case _**thought**_, ceasing to exist.

And if man thinks, then his activities are subordinated to law and cannot overstep its bounds, although he may at the same time break the rules in the most flagrant way. A law can be ‘broken’ in one way only, by ceasing to think, i.e. by escaping from the realm that is governed by the laws of thought and where they operate as inexorably as the law of gravitation in the world of spatially determined bodies. But for man such a ‘way out’ is equivalent to overstepping the bounds of human existence in general.

Hegel also showed that the real development of determinations, i.e. the real forward movement of thought, even in the simplest cases, not to mention the process of development of science, technique, and morality, took place precisely through breach (or removal) of all the rules that had been established for thought by the old logic, through their dialectical negation. But the constant _**negation**_ of the rules established by conscious thought for itself got out of control, was not aware of itself, and proved to be a fact _**outside thought**_, although it took place within the latter. Thought had this fact ‘in itself’ but not ‘_**for itself**_’.

But as soon as this fact was recognised as a universal and necessary logical thought-form, it was also transformed into a _**fact of consciousness**_, a fact of conscious thought, and the latter became _**consciously**_ dialectical. Previously it had only been so ‘in itself’, i.e. despite its own consciousness of itself. But now it became ‘for itself’ precisely what it had previously been only ‘in itself’.

The subject matter of logic consequently could not merely be the forms that had already been realised or apprehended, and had already been included in existing consciousness (in textbooks of logic and metaphysics). It was impossible to grasp them _**ready-made**_, or to classify them. They had to be brought out in the very course of reasoning about them, in the course of actual thinking about thought.

And when Kant considered the forms of thought as some ready-made object, already depicted (realised, comprehended), his logic represented only an uncritical classification of existing notions about thought.

But if logic was to be a science, it must be a critical, systematic investigation that did not accept a single determination on faith, and unproved by thought, i.e. without being reproduced by it quite consciously. In this investigation _**criticism**_ of the thought-forms known to cultivated thinking was only possible and thinkable as _**self-criticism**_. The schemas, rules, forms, principles, and laws of this thought were here subjected to criticism not by comparing them with some object lying outside them, but solely by bringing out the dialectic they included in themselves and which was discovered immediately as soon as we began in general to think, rigorously and fully realising what we were doing and how we were doing it.

In that way, too, the very identity of the forms of cultivated thought with the forms of the unconsciously performed actions of the intellect must be carried out, actions to which thought had had to submit during the historical process of its realisation in the form of science, technique, art and morality. Logic was nothing else (or rather should be nothing else) than the proper apprehension of those forms and laws within which the real thinking of people took place. The identity of thought and the conceivable, as the principle of the logical development and construction of logic, signified nothing more.

It was merely a matter of this, that the schemas of _**cultivated thought**_ (i.e. of the processes taking place in the consciousness of the individual) should coincide with those of the structure of the science in the movement of which the individual was involved, i.e. with the ‘logic’ dictated by its content. If the schema of the activity of a theoretician coincided with that of the development of his science, and the science was thus developed through his activity, Hegel would attest the _**logicality**_ of his activity, i.e. the _**identity**_ of his thinking with that impersonal, universal process which we also call the development of science. Logic recognised the activities of such a theoretician as logical also when they were even formally not quite irreproachable from the standpoint of the canons of the old logic.

Hegel therefore began to consider all the categories (of quality, quantity, measure, causality, probability, necessity, the general and the particular, and so on and so forth) in quite a new way. For him they were not at all the most general determinations of the things given in intuition or contemplation or in direct experience to each individual, not transcendental schemas of synthesis directly inherent (i.e. inborn) in each individual consciousness (as Kant, Fichte, and Schelling had in fact treated them). It was impossible to discover these thought-forms in the separate consciousness taken in isolation, within the individual Ego. They were there at best only ‘in themselves’, only in the form of unrealised tendencies and so not brought to awareness. Categories were only discovered and demonstrated their determinations through the historically developing scientific, technical, and moral ‘perfecting’ of the human race, because only in it, and not in the experience of the isolated individual, did thought become ‘for itself’ what it had been ‘in itself’.

Categories themselves, in the individual’s own experience (were revealed in action, in processing of the data of perception) not in the whole fullness and dialectical complexity of their composition and connections but only in abstract, one-sided aspects. It was therefore impossible to derive them from analysis of the experience of the isolated individual. They were only discovered through the very complex process of the interaction of a mass of single minds mutually correcting each other in discussion, debate, and confrontations, i.e. through a frankly dialectical process that, like a huge centrifuge, ultimately separated the purely objective schemas of thought from the purely subjective (in the sense of individual, arbitrary) schemas of activity, and as a result crystallised out logic, a system of determinations of purely universal, impersonal, and featureless thought in general.

Categories were therefore also universal forms of the origin of any object in _**thought**_, gradually depicted in the aggregate scientific consciousness of humanity. They were universal determinations of the object _**as and how**_ it appeared in the eyes of science, in the ether of ‘universal thought’. Hegel consented to call determinations of things only those determinations that had been developed by science, by active thought. They were, therefore, none other than thought-forms realised in concrete material, determinations of thought embodied in the object, i e. in the scientific concept of the external thing. Hegel, therefore, and only therefore, also spoke of the identity of thought and object and defined the object as a concept realised in sensuous, physical material.

The determinations of categories, naturally, could also function as determinations of things in the contemplation (experience) of the individual; not of every individual, however, but only of those who in the course of their education had mastered the historical experience of humanity, and ‘reproduced’ in their individual consciousness the path taken by human thought (of course, only in its main, decisive features and schemas). Categories were the forms of organisation of this experience (described by Hegel in his _Phenomenology of Mind_ ).

Categories were thus universal forms of the reconstruction, reproduction, in the _**consciousness of the individual**_ of those objects that had been created before him by the collective efforts of past generations of thinking beings, by the power of their collective, impersonal thought. In individually repeating the experience of humanity, which had created the world of spiritual and material culture surrounding him from the cradle, this individual also repeated that which had been done before him and for him by the ‘universal spirit’, and so acted according to the same laws and in the same forms as the impersonal ‘universal spirit’ of humanity. That means that categories appeared at once as universal schemas of the scientific formation of the individual consciousness, rising gradually from the zero level of its erudition to the highest stages of spiritual culture at the given moment, and as schemas of the individual mastery (reproduction) of the whole world of images created by the thought of preceding generations and standing opposed to the individual as a quite objective world of spiritual and material culture, the world of the concepts of science, technique and morality.

This world was the materialised thought of humanity, realised in the product, was alienated thought in general; and the individual had to de-objectify, and arrogate to himself, the modes of activity that were realised in it, and it was in that the process if his/her education properly consisted. In the trained mind categories actually functioned as active forms of a concept. When the individual had them in his/her experience, and made them forms of his/her own activity, he/she also possessed them, and knew and realised them, _**as thought-forms**_. Otherwise they remained only _**general forms of the things**_ given in contemplation and representation, and counterposed to thought as a reality existing outside it and independently of it.

With this was linked the naive fetishism that directly accepted the _**available**_ concepts and notions of science about things, the norms of morals and justice, the forms of the state and political system and the similar products of the thinking of people who had objectified their own conscious activity in them, for purely objective determinations of things in themselves. It accepted them as such only because it _**did not know**_ that they had not been created without the involvement of thought, and did not know _**how**_, moreover, they were produced by thought. It could not reproduce or repeat the process of thought that had brought them into being and therefore, naturally, considered them eternal and unalterable determinations of things in themselves, and the expression of their essence. It believed quite uncritically, on trust, everything that it was told about these things in the name of science, the state and God. It believed not only that these things _**appeared**_ so today in the eyes of the thinking person but also that they were really so.

Hegel’s conception of thought (in the context of logic) thus of necessity also included the process of the ‘objectification of thought’ (_VVergegenständlichung oder Entäusserung des Denkens_), i.e. its sense-object, practical realisation through action, in sensuous-physical material, in the world of sensuously contemplated (intuited) things. Practice, the process of activity on sense objects that altered things in accordance with a concept, in accordance with plans matured in the womb of subjective thought, began to be considered here as just as important a level in the development of thought and understanding, as the subjective-mental act of reasoning (according to the rules) expressed in speech.

Hegel thus directly introduced practice into logic, and made a fundamental advance in the understanding of thought and in the science of thought.

Since thought outwardly expressed itself _(sich entäussert, sich entfremdet_, i.e. ‘alienates itself’, ‘makes itself something outside itself’) not only in the form of speech but also in real actions and in people’s deeds, it could be judged much better ‘by its fruits’ than by the notions that it created about itself. Thought, therefore, that was realised in people’s actual actions also proved to be the true criterion of the correctness of those subjective-mental acts that were outwardly expressed only in words, in speeches, and in books.

August Thalheimer: Introduction to Dialectical Materialism

### 11 - Dialectics II

So far we have discussed the most general and most fundamental law of dialectics, namely, the law of the permeation of opposites, or the law of polar unity. We shall now take up the second main proposition of dialectics, the law of the negation of the negation, or the law of development through opposites. This is the most general law of the process of thought. I will first state the law itself and support it with examples, and then I will show on what it is based and how it is related to the first law of the permeation of opposites. There is already a presentiment of this law in the oldest Chinese philosophy, in the _of Transformations_, as well as in Lao-tse and his disciples - and likewise in the oldest Greek philosophy, especially in Heraclitus. Not until Hegel, however, was this law developed.

This law applies to all motion and changes of things, to real things as well as to their images in our minds, i.e., concepts. It states first of all that things and concepts move, change, and develop; all things are processes. All fixity of individual things is only relative, limited; their motion, change, or development is absolute, unlimited. For the world as a whole absolute motion and absolute rest coincide. The proof of this part of the proposition, namely, that all things are in flux, we have already given in our discussion of Heraclitus.

The law of the negation of the negation has a special sense beyond the mere proposition that all things are processes and change. It also states something about the most general form of these changes, motions, or developments. It states, in the first place, that all motion, development, or change, takes place through opposites or contradictions, or through the negation of a thing.

Conceptually the actual movement of things appears as a negation. In other words, negation is the most general way in which motion or change of things is represented in the mind. This is the first stage of this process. The negation of a thing from which the change proceeds, however, is in turn subject to the law of the transformation of things into their opposites. The negation is itself negated. Thus we speak of the negation of the negation.

The negation of negation logically results in something positive, in thought as well as in reality. Negation and affirmation are polar concepts. Negation of the affirmation results in negation; negation of the negation equals affirmation. If I negate yes, I get no, the first negation. If I negate no, I get yes, the second negation. The result is something positive.

Thus even in ordinary speech an affirmation results from a double negation. However, and this is the distinctive feature, the old and the original are not re-established by the double negation in dialectics; it is not simply a return to the starting point, but something new arises. The thing or the condition with which the process started is re-established on a higher plane. Through the process of double negation new qualities and a new form emerge, a form in which the original qualities are retained and enhanced.

If the expression, law of the negation of the negation, sounds strange to you, you may also use the expression, law of the creation of the new out of the old, which is quite simple. This law has also been given a special formulation as a law of thought. As such it assumes the following form: the starting point is the positive proposition or the thesis. All thinking starts with some kind of proposition, some kind of statement. This proposition is negated or transformed into its opposite. This new proposition, which negates the first, I call the opposite or antithesis. This is the second stage. Then this second proposition, the antithesis, is again negated, and, as you know, we then(get the third proposition or synthesis, the negation of thesis and antithesis into a higher positive proposition effected by the further negation.

To understand this law correctly one must guard against two misinterpretations or distortions.

Thesis and antithesis are dialectically united in the final proposition, the synthesis. The dialectical union must not be mistaken for the mere summation of those qualities of two opposite things which remain after mutually exclusive qualities are cancelled. Dialectical development does not occur this way; this would simply be a mixture or effacement of opposites, a hindrance to dialectical development. It is a necessary characteristic of dialectical development that it fulfill itself through negations. Without negation there is no process, no development, no emergence of the new. In society this negation is expressed in struggle which abolishes the old. False dialectics or pseudo-dialectics says that a mutual understanding, a compromise is attempted between the old and the new, that an attempt is made to unite the old and the new, _without rejecting the old_ (I do not wish to imply, of course. that all compromise is a negation of struggle. A compromise may even be a weapon of struggle.)

This misunderstanding of the dialectics of development is due to the fact that the role of negation as an essential factor in unification is forgotten. But there is also an opposite misunderstanding arising from a disregard of the fact that the new which emerges from the process of development not only negates or neutralizes the old, but also retains the old. If this is ignored, the dialectics of development is distorted, as, for example, in the case of the French philosopher, |Henri Bergson. With Bergson development becomes an incomprehensible, mystical process in which the relations between the old and the new are conceived of only as oppositions and not, at the same time, as identities.

The fundamental error in Bergson's conception of dialectics is his disregard of the fact that the new which has developed from the old, stands not only in opposition to the old, is not only its negation, but has, at the same time, something in common with the old. If one follows the thought of Bergson, it becomes evident that it cancels itself. There is only one kind of negation in which the thing negated has nothing more to do with that from which the development proceeded. This is complete or unconditioned negation or destruction. If I completely negate a thing, I destroy it, and development is completely stopped. If development is forced beyond its limits, as it is with Bergson, if it is made absolute, it is transformed into its opposite, into fixity or lack of development. Negation in the dialectical process is not absolute, unconditioned, or complete; it is relative, conditioned, and partial. Dialectics concerns itself with definite, concrete negation. The first distortion of dialectics, the distortion which disregards negation, may be called the opportunistic distortion. The second in which the retention of the old in the new is disregarded may be called the anarchistic distortion. These two opposed distortions of dialectics, the opportunistic as well as the anarchistic, are alike in that both put an end to development - the first because it puts an end to negation as the moving force of development, and the second because it puts an end to the connection between opposites.

To make this general abstract law a little clearer, I will give a few examples. Take a grain of rice. Suppose I am giving you the problem of starting a developmental process with this grain of rice. How will you do it? You will put the grain of rice into the earth or into water according to whether you wish to plant wet or dry rice. What will happen? The first negation of the grain of rice occurs. The grain dissolves and out of it a rice plant develops. First negation: the grain of rice dissolves and changes into a plant. The original grain of rice is thereby destroyed. The second act proceeds of itself. The rice plant grows and finally develops rice grains; and as soon as it reaches the point where it produces seeds, grains of rice, it perishes. Second negation: The rice plant is destroyed and the grain is re-established, not the old but new grain, not _one_ but many, and in all probability not of the old quality but with new characteristics. These slight variations connected with reproduction are, as a rule, inconsiderable and inconstant. However, their accumulation and consolidation result, according to the Darwinian theory, in the formation of new species from old. This process is an example of the negation of the negation. The double negation re-establishes the original state but on a higher plane and in a different quantity. The Bergsonian distortion of dialectics, it is obvious, is very closely connected with the present historical position of the bourgeoisie. The mystical or falsified dialectics of the Bergsonian type rejects historical regularity and replaces it by miracle, arbitrariness, and incomprehensibility whereby nothing is impossible.

I will illustrate the two misunderstandings or distortions of dialectics of which I have spoken by using the same example. The first distortion, the Bergsonian, or as one could say, the anarchistic distortion, may be illustrated thus: the law of dialectics demands that I negate the grain of rice. This can be done more thoroughly, it might be said. Instead of planting it in the earth, I can put it into a mortar and break it to pieces. As a consequence its negation will be so thorough that further development becomes impossible. This is the first distortion. It is apparent from this that for each thing there is a particular kind of negation which initiates a developmental process, a negation appropriate to the nature of the thing.

The second or opportunistic distortion of dialectics occurs when negation is ignored. The person to whom I give the grain of rice may say that it can develop "of itself." He neither crushes it nor puts it into the around. He will let it lie on the table. And, of course, it will not develop into a plant. It will finally perish as an organism. This illustrates, incidentally, how these two opposed distortions of dialectics have the same result. No development occurs and the object is destroyed. On the other hand, if I negate purposively and initiate a developmental process, the thing will be destroyed and, at the same time, it will develop into something new and higher. I will give you a second example drawn from the history of social or economic forms. You know that the very first mode of production of which we have any knowledge was primitive communism, i.e., the collective ownership of the decisive means of production by a small community of people. This primitive communism is the point of departure of all social development; it represents the thesis, the proposition. Primitive communism was dissolved, negated. In the place of collective ownership of the means of production and collective production, there appeared private production, slave economy, feudalistic production, simple commodity production, and finally capitalistic production. This is the antithesis. The negation of primitive communism is private production in its various historical forms. Then comes the third stage: the negation, in its turn, of private production, the re-establishment of collective property, of communism on a higher plane. Through this twofold negation the development returns to its starting point, but on a higher plane. Socialist or communist production, as it emerges from capitalist production, is no longer primitive communism, but communism at a much more developed stage since it retains the technical achievements of capitalism. Man is now in control of nature, whereas in the stage of primitive communism it controlled him. And the compass of modern communist society is vastly greater than primitive communism. At most, primitive communism could bring just a few communities together into an economic unit, whereas modern socialism or communism is capable of embracing the entire world economy. I have just emphasized the extent to which modern communism differs from primitive communism. Nevertheless, primitive communism is retained in modern communism. Common ownership of the means of production is re-established. Capitalism is negated, dissolved into communism. But this negation is not absolute or abstract; it is relative, concrete, conditioned. Capitalist technology as well as co-operation in the factory are retained. Finally, I wish to illustrate the two distortions of dialectics in terms of this same example. The first distortion, which disregards the necessity of dissolving or negating capitalism in order to attain socialism, is the well-known reformist or opportunistic conception The second distortion of dialectics in this field, the distortion which overlooks the fact that elements of capitalism are taken over for the construction of socialism, is the conception of anarchists. For these reasons I have called the first the opportunistic and the second the anarchistic distortion of dialectics. History shows that these two distortions alternate and replace each other.

We now ask, where does the law of the negation of the negation come from? What is its relation to the first main proposition of the permeation of opposites? Obviously, it is related directly to the law of the permeation of opposites. It is the permeation of opposites as a process, a process in time, in sequence. The permeation of opposites as a process results in the law of the negation of the negation or the law of development through opposites. The first main proposition, the law of the permeation of opposites, represents the most general relations of things from the point of view of structure or static being. The second proposition of the negation of the negation represents the relation of things as a process, i.e., dynamically. These two propositions are so related that they hold true for every process, for everything at the same time and to the same extent. The two propositions permeate each other; they form a coherent whole. The first gives a cross-section of the world, the second a longitudinal section.

We now come to the third main proposition of dialectics, the proposition of the transformation of quality into quantity and of quantity into quality. The proposition states that the mere augmentation of a thing or things produces a change of quality, of characteristics, and, conversely, that a qualitative change produces a quantitative one.

I should like to illustrate this with a few examples. Let us take the first one from physics - water. Water has a definite temperature and if you raise the temperature to a certain point you will not get hotter and hotter water, but at a certain point you will get steam. And, likewise, if you lower the temperature, the water does not become colder indefinitely; at a certain point it becomes ice. It freezes because of the decreased quantity of molecular motion. The temperature is merely an expression of the motion of the smallest particles, the molecules. If you change the quantity of the molecular motion or the speed with which the molecules move about, the characteristics will change at certain points, from gas to liquid, liquid to solid. Conversely, ice can only be changed to water or water to steam if the quantity of molecular motion is changed. The finest example of the law of transformation of quantity into quality is now being given by atomic research. The various qualities of the atoms of chemical elements are correlated with the simple numerical relations of their components of the next lowest order, the electrons.

An additional example from zoology and botany: you know that all plants and animals are composed, in the last analysis, of small elementary units, of cells. Every living being develops from one or several small cells. All differences of living creatures derive from different quantities of cells. If I increase the cells, other organisms emerge with different characteristics and forms.

Then there is the reverse process: it is possible to take a certain number of cells away from an organism without harming it. It will remain the same. But as soon as this is continued beyond a certain point, the organism is harmed. If a man's hair is cut off, he does not suffer, but if his arm or leg is cut off, he will undergo a qualitative change. In fact, he will probably die. You may draw a certain amount of blood from a person, but beyond a certain point, death will result - a qualitative change.

A last example from political economy: you have learned in political economy that a sum of money can only function as capital after it has reached a certain minimum amount. One dollar, for example, is not capital, and neither are ten dollars; 10,000 dollars, however, may function under certain conditions as capital. A mere change in quantity changes a sum of money into capital; it takes on different characteristics, produces a different effect - a qualitative change occurs. If capital is allowed to grow through concentration and centralization a new qualitative change takes place, namely, a change to monopoly capital. You know from your political economy that monopoly capital has characterized an entire period of capitalist development, i.e., the imperialist period. And, on the other hand, as soon as you have monopolistic capitalism, this new quality is in turn transformed into quantitative relations and characteristics. Monopoly capital realizes a higher rate of profit than non-monopoly capital. Monopoly prices are generally higher than prices under free competition, etc.

We ask, finally, what relation obtains between this third proposition of dialectics and the first two. And the answer is clearly that the law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa merely represents a special application of the first proposition, the law of the permeation of opposites. Quality and quantity are polar opposites. Quality is quantity analyzed; quantity is quality analyzed. An apple, a pear, and a plum all have different qualities. They can only be counted together if their different qualities are abstracted from them or negated. I cannot add an apple, a pear, and a plum; I can only say: three pieces of fruit. In other words, negated quality is quantity; negated quantity is quality. These opposites are contained in each thing. Each thing has a definite size, quantity, or degree, and at the same time definite characteristics. All things have, at the same time, quality and quantity. As opposites they permeate each other and are transformed into each other.

This brings me to the end of dialectics. Of course, it must not be assumed that knowledge of these few propositions makes one completely familiar with dialectics. A long list of other propositions, which w cannot discuss here, derive from these few main propositions. Nor must it be assumed that the mere memorization of formulas is the key to dialectics. The important thing is to be conscious of the dialectical nature of things and of thought. Dialectical thinking is not magic. Neither is it part of everyone's natural equipment. It is an art which must be learned and practised. The most general characteristic of dialectical thought is the study of things in their interrelations, in both one-beside-the-other relations and one-after-the-other relations, - that is, in their changes.

### George Novack’s Understanding History

# Is Nature Dialectical?

---

On December 7, 1961, 6000 young people gathered in a Paris auditorium to listen to a debate on dialectics by four noted French scholars.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/novack/works/history/ch13.htm#fw01) Such a meeting would be as unlikely in New York as the outdoor recitals poets give before large crowds in Moscow. Different countries, different customs—and different levels of cultural and intellectual development.

The participants in the symposium represented the two most widely discussed philosophies of our time: existentialism and Marxism. Neither trend of thought has the following in the United States that the first has in Western Europe or the second in communist countries. America’s ideological life is provincial and lags far behind the most advanced movements elsewhere.

Jean-Paul Sartre, possibly the most influential living man of letters, and Jean Hyppolite, Sorbonne professor and Hegelian scholar, upheld the existentialist viewpoint. Roger Garaudy of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, director of its Centre for Marxist Studies and Research, and author of numerous philosophical works, and Jean-Pierre Vigier, one of France’s leading theoretical physicists, spoke for Marxism. Their topic was: “Is the dialectic solely a law of history or is it also a law of nature?”

It is possible to hold one of three main positions on this question. The first is that dialectics is sheer metaphysics, a vestige of theology, an aberration of logic, meaningless verbiage which has no reference to reality and is useless for scientific thought in any field. This is the opinion of almost all scholars, scientists, and those trained by them in the universities of the US and England, where empiricism, positivism, and pragmatism hold sway.

Another is that dialectics is valid in certain domains but not in others. Adherents of partial dialectics usually maintain that its laws apply to mental or social processes but not to nature. For them a dialectic of nature belongs to Hegelian idealism, not to a consistent materialism. This position has been put forward by quite a number of Marxists and semi-Marxists. Such is the view taken by the existentialists Sartre and Hyppolite.

The third position is that dialectical materialism deals with the entire universe and its logic holds good for all the constituent sectors of reality which enter into human experience: nature, society, and thought. The laws of dialectics, which have arisen out of the investigation of universal processes of becoming and modes of being, apply to all phenomena. Although each level of being has its own specific laws, these merge with general laws covering all spheres of existence and development, which constitute the content and shape the method of materialist dialectics. This view, held by the creators of scientific socialism and their authentic disciples, was defended in the debate by Garaudy, Vigier, and the chairman, Jean Orcel, professor of mineralogy at the National Museum of Natural History.

An American would consider it strange that the controversy on the question should take place only between two schools of dialecticians, one piecemeal, the other thoroughgoing. Very few people in the United States today are convinced that dialectical logic of any kind is worth serious consideration.

A broad spectrum of attitudes toward Marxism is exhibited in the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. In the US, where capitalism reigns supreme, anything associated with socialism and communism is depreciated, if not tabooed. Marxism is regarded as obsolete, its philosophy false.

In the Soviet Union, where the socialist revolution abolished capitalism decades ago, dialectical materialism is the state philosophy. Under Stalin, in fact, it became scholasticised and ossified, as Vigier admits and Hyppolite testifies. The latter tells how during a recent visit the Soviet Academy of Sciences contrived to have him talk to the students about mechanism instead of existentialism, as he wished. However, all the questions after his lecture related to existentialism. “It seems to me that the youth were strongly interested in Sartre’s existential philosophy”, he dryly observes.

The intellectual and political climate of France stands between those of the major cold war antagonists. There is lively tension and continual intercourse between Marxist and non-Marxist currents of thought, and especially between the politically oriented atheistic existentialists such as Sartre, and various exponents of Marxism. Sartre and C. Wright Mills reflect the ideological differences between their two countries. Mills held a place among radical intellectuals in the English-speaking world like that of Sartre in Europe. Yet in his last work, _The Marxists_, Mills dismissed the laws of dialectics as something “mysterious, which Marx never explains clearly but which his disciples claim to use”. Indeed, even this footnote reference was an afterthought added to his original manuscript in deference to friendly critics.

Such a blackout of dialectics would be unthinkable for Sartre. He was educated and lives in an environment where both Hegelian and Marxist philosophies are taken seriously, on a continent where scientific socialism has influenced intellectual and public life for almost a century, and in a country where the Communist Party gets a quarter of the vote and has the allegiance of much of the working class. He has developed his own ideas in contact and contest with Marxism, from the time he propounded the philosophy of existence as its rival to the present stage, when he conceives of existentialism as a subordinate ideology within Marxism which aspires to renovate and enrich it.

Mills took from Marxism only those elements that suited his empirical sociology and New Left orientation. He cut the dialectical heart out of the Marxist method of thought and presented what was left as the whole organism. Sartre has a higher esteem for dialectics. But as we shall see, he too accepts only what can be fitted into his Marxised existentialism.

The transcript of this Paris debate between existentialists and Marxists is worth examining at length because many of the chief objections to materialist dialectics were posed and answered in the light of present-day scientific developments.

Sartre’s case against a dialectic of nature is quite different from that of an American pragmatist or positivist. His arguments are distinctively existentialist.

He agrees that history and knowledge are dialectical processes because they are created by humanity and humanity is involved in their development. There is a historical materialism but no dialectical materialism. Dialectics is internal to history. The province of dialectics cannot go beyond human practice. It is illegitimate to extend dialectical laws to nonhistorical, nonhuman phenomena. Sartre presents three main reasons for this restriction:

1. Dialectics deals only with concrete totalities which human beings themselves “totalised” through practice. History and society are such. Nature, on the other hand, does not constitute a single integrated whole. Nature may be infinite, even contain an infinity of infinites. But it consists of fragmented totalities which have no inner unity, no universal and necessary interconnection. The disunity of nature forbids any universal dialectic.

2. The contradictions operating in history cannot be the same as antagonisms in nature. Social contradictions are based upon the reciprocal conditioning and organic interpenetration of their contending sides through human mediation. The opposing forces inside a physical-chemical system are not interactive and interrelated in this way. Brute matter, the “practico-inert”, is disjointed, dispersed, resistant to dialectical movement.

3. We can know society and history from the inside, as they really are, because they are the work of humanity, the result of our decision and action. Their dialectical linkages are disclosed through the contradictory interplay of subject and situation. But physical phenomena remain external to us and to other objects. They are opaque to our insight. We cannot penetrate to their real inner nature and grasp their essence.

In sum, nature must be nondialectical because of its disunity, its lack of contradiction, its insurmountable externality and inertia. The only possible dialectical materialism is historical materialism, which views our establishment of relations with the rest of reality from the standpoint of our action upon it.

Orthodox Marxists revert to theology and metaphysics, says Sartre, by extending dialectical laws over nature on purely philosophical or methodological grounds. He does, however, concede that dialectical laws may at some point be found applicable to nature. But only by way of analogy. This presently involves a risky extrapolation, which must await verification through further findings by the natural scientists. And even if they should discover that physical processes resemble the dialectical type and start to use dialectical models in their research, this would provide no insight into the nature of nature, no true knowledge of its essential features.

Thus the existentialist Sartre turns out to be a positivist in his last word on the possible relations of dialectics to the physical world. For him the ideas of this logic can be no more than handy hypotheses in metaphorical dress that may help scientists order and clarify their data but cannot reflect the content of nature.

Sartre is not consistent in his effort to imprison dialectics in the social world and strike it out of prehuman and nonhuman phenomena. His arguments against the dialectics of nature are more fully set forth in his 1960 philosophical work of 755 pages, _Critique of Dialectical Reason_, of which the first part was published here in 1963 under the title _Search for a Method_. There he admits that living matter, at least, may develop dialectically. Sartre writes: “The organism engenders the negative as that which disrupts its unity; disassimilation and excretion are still opaque and biological forms of negation in so far as they are a movement oriented toward rejection.” This exception opens a breach in his position. Garaudy correctly observes that once Sartre has recognised that negation and totalisation exist in the prehuman state, it will be difficult to stop halfway and keep dialectics confined to biology without extending its jurisdiction to the rest of nature.

In his rejoinder to Sartre, who wishes to see only partial unities or specific totalities in nature, Vigier points out that nature is a whole made up of myriad parts. The reality of the universe we inhabit is both material and dialectical. Its unity is expressed in an infinite series of levels of existence. Each of the specific realms of being which collectively constitute the material universe is finite, partial; it incorporates only a limited aspect of the whole.

In itself nature is endless and inexhaustible. It forever generates new properties, modes, and fields of existence. There are no limits to what it has been, to what it now is, to what it may become. One of the major errors of mechanical and metaphysical thought about nature, Vigier says, is the notion that it is based upon ultimate elements from which everything else issues and with which the rest of reality can be built up. This conception, which goes back to the Greek atomists, has been carried forward by the natural scientists who believed that molecules, atoms, and then “elementary” particles were the basic building blocks of the entire universe.

Actually science has been developing along different lines, both in regard to the universe at large (the macrocosm) and to the subatomic domain (the microcosm). There is no foreseeable end to astronomical phenomena or our discovery of them, as the recently discovered “black holes” indicate. What appears immobile on one level is really in flux at another level. There are in principle no irreducible or immutable elements in nature. This has just been reconfirmed by the acknowledgment that so-called elementary particles can no longer be considered the ultimate objects of microphysics. New microparticles keep turning up which reveal more profound movements and antagonisms.

The history and practice of the sciences demonstrate that various totalities exist in nature as well as in human history. Vigier points out that living organisms are totalities which can be decomposed into finer totalities such as the giant molecules. Farther afield, the earth, the solar system, our galaxy, and all galactic systems taken together can be approached and analysed as totalities with a disregard for their detailed fluctuations. The distinct totalities which are found all around us in nature are relative, partial, and limited. Yet, far from negating the unity of nature, they constitute and confirm it.

Experiments show that however complicated the biochemistry of life, its processes are fundamentally the same from the algae to the human organism. We ourselves are made of star-stuff. It has been ascertained that the universe has a common chemistry, just as all the diverse forms of life on earth share similar biological laws. The same elements that make up the earth and its inhabitants are present in the most remote stellar regions.

The substantial unity of nature is asserted not only in its structural components, but in its stages and modes of development. Science is rapidly filling in a vast panorama of cosmic advancement. It is uncertain how the observable universe originated, if it did at all. But it has certainly evolved—from the creation of the elements, the constitution of the stellar galaxies, and other celestial phenomena to the birth of our solar system and the formation of the earth’s crust and atmosphere. Then it proceeded to the chemical conditions required for the primary reactions leading to the first forms of life, on through the transformations of organic species, up to the advent of humanity. All this has been climaxed by the birth and forward movement of society over the past million-odd years.

This unified process of development is the real basis for the universality of the dialectic, which maintains that everything is linked together and interactive, in continuous motion and change, and that this change is the outcome of the conflicts of opposing forces within nature as well as everything to be found in it.

To assert that everything is in the last analysis connected with everything else does not nullify the relative autonomy of specific formations and singular things. But the separation of one thing from another, its qualitative distinctions from everything else, breaks down at a certain point in time and in space. So long as the opposing forces are in balance the totality appears stable, harmonious, at rest—and is really so. But this is a transient condition. Sooner or later, alterations in the inner relation of forces, and interactions with other processes in the environment, upset the achieved equilibrium, generate instability, and can eventuate in the disruption and destruction of the most hard-and-fast formations. Dialectics is fundamentally the most consistent way of thinking about the universal interconnections of things in the full range of their development.

In addition to denying the unity of nature, Sartre attempts to erect impassable barriers between different orders of existence by splitting nature from human history. Is this justified by the facts? There was a profound interruption in the continuity of natural evolution, a qualitative jump, when humankind lifted itself above the other primates by means of the labour process. There are basic differences between nature and society; they have different laws of development. But there is no unbridgeable gap between them.

Just as the inorganic gave rise to the organic, that in turn and in time engendered social life, the distinctive field of human action. But all three sectors of reality remain in the closest communion. The chemical elements (nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen) which enter into the total metabolism of organisms through food consumption, inhaling, exhaling, internal utilisation and breakdown, excretion and elimination, return to the atmosphere, earth, and water for reuse. Our economy as well as our physiology exhibits the unbreakable unity of the diverse levels of being. The farmer furrowing the soil with an animal-drawn plough and seeding it brings together mineral, botanical, zoological, and human forces in the unified process of producing food.

The inanimate, the animate, and the social belong to a single stream of material existence and evolution with endless currents.

Are the oppositions in nature so radically different from contradictions in the life of humanity as Sartre contends? Contradictions on every level of existence have their peculiar characteristics, which must be found out in the course of practical experience and formulated in scientific inquiry. The sociological law that as technology expands, the productive forces of humankind tend to grow beyond and conflict with the relations of production and the property forms in which they have been encased is very different from Isaac Newton’s laws of motion.

Does this mean that physical and social processes have no common denominators? Marxism maintains that general laws of being and becoming exist which allow both for the identities and differences, the persistent and the changing, in the real world. They embrace both nature and human life and are capable of expression as laws of logical thought. Included in the inventory of the laws of dialectics are the interpenetration of opposites, the passage of quantity into quality, the negation of the negation, the conflict of form and content, and many others. They are as relevant to nature as to society because they are rooted in the objective world.

Vigier observes that “internal antagonisms (that is to say, the assemblage of forces which necessarily evolve in contrary directions) illustrate the nature of contradiction Ö The unity of opposites is understood as the unity of elements on one level which engenders the phenomena of a higher level. The transformation of quantity into quality is interpreted as the sudden rupture of equilibrium within a system (for example, the destruction of one of the antagonistic forces), which modifies the equilibrium and gives rise to a qualitatively new phenomenon in the midst of which new contradictions appear.”

Vigier cites the advances of modern physics as evidence of the intrinsically contradictory properties of analysed systems, which contain simplicity and complexity, inertia and violent motion at one and the same time. “The material elements considered inert at one level, for example the macroscopic bodies described by classical physics, are revealed upon analysis to be prodigiously complex and mobile as scientific knowledge progresses. On our scale this table can appear to me inert, but we know it is composed of molecules in extremely complex and violent motion. These molecules themselves can be decomposed into mobile atoms when I push analysis much further. Finally, the atoms themselves split into so-called ‘elementary particles’ which in their turn disclose equally mobile and complex internal structures.”

The motion dealt with in contemporary microphysics is not considered as the simple shift of an inert element from one point to another but rather as a violent oscillating movement which develops at one point to the degree it is destroyed in the immediately preceding position. Each side of this dual process of annihilation and creation reciprocally conditions the other.

The new emerges from the old in nature by way of contradiction, that is to say, by negating the essential properties of the previous form of being and absorbing its reconstituted elements into a higher synthesis. The major leaps from one qualitative state to another take place on the borderlands of evolution where one state of matter passes over into another.

Biochemists are now seeking to ascertain and duplicate the successive steps through which purely chemical reactions produced the first biochemical mechanisms. Although the inorganic is the matrix, the mother of life, life on earth is something radically novel. As a totality it is other and more than a chemical process; it has structures, properties, and powers that go far beyond its predecessor. “It is necessary to seek in the mineral for the origin of the processes and materials of the organic world”, says J.D. Bernal, the British physicist, “but life itself represents a capital stage in the evolution of matter: the containment of continual chemical processes in a limited volume.”

Formal logic, which is based on abstract, or simple, identity (A equals A), is too one-sided to explain this negation of one state of matter and its transformation into its opposite, in this case the lifeless into the living, because it excludes from its premises real difference and contradiction, which is the extreme development of difference. But the unity of opposites (A equals non-A), which makes contradiction explicit and intelligible, can explain this transition, which actually occurred on earth. The emergence of life from the nonliving in turn substantiates the objective basis in nature of this law of concrete contradiction, a cornerstone of dialectical logic.

According to Sartre, we are barred from knowing the inside of nature because it is not the work of humankind. Are physical-chemical phenomena inaccessible to us because we do not have such direct contact with them as with history? To be sure, remarks Vigier, we have to make and employ experimental devices to delve into the thick of things. But through these instruments we do find out their real properties and inner relations.

How can we be sure that our ideas actually correspond to what nature is “in itself”? This is no new question for philosophy, and Marxism developed a theory of knowledge to answer it. Sartre, like Immanuel Kant, bases his agnosticism upon the supposedly impenetrable character of materiality. Garaudy points out that while relations between the subject and object, the human and nonhuman, may initially be opaque, they can be rendered more and more transparent by practice and theory.

The proof that we know what things really are comes from useful practice. From solar masses to subatomic particles, we handle the materials and direct the operations of nature for our social purposes.

If we project through action an idea or scientific hypothesis about the material world or any portion of it, we receive a response, either negative or affirmative. The idea either fits the situation or it does not. Both responses enable us to deal with, and eventually to understand, the features and functions of nature. They disclose not only the movement but the structure of reality.

A new hypothesis does not simply destroy the old, leading to null results in the history of thought. The superior hypothesis that replaces the cruder and narrower one contains within itself whatever remains valid and valuable in its outworn and discarded predecessor, as an automatic shear retains the cutting edge of chipped stone and Albert Einstein’s relativity theory includes and explains what is true and useful in Newtonian physics. Knowledge progresses and accumulates in this dialectical manner. It is thus possible to deepen our understanding and extend our control. Even if we never get to learn everything about nature, the verified knowledge actually gained through endless investigation enables us to probe ever more deeply into its recesses.

The issue in dispute is whether the structure and movement of nature disclosed by science and experiment is such that only a dialectical method of thought renders the phenomena intelligible and manageable. Sartre evades a definite answer to this question by walling up nature in an unbreachable externality with no windows we can look and reach through. He rejects the Marxist conception that human knowledge reflects objective reality.

Garaudy is obliged to clear up two common misunderstandings about this theory which Sartre plays upon. The term “reflection” does not signify that knowledge is a passive phenomenon which merely duplicates the object, like a mirror image, or mechanically reproduces it, like a stamping machine. The process of conception is more complex and active. Arising out of work and everyday practice, stimulated by the predicaments of life, the human mind invents ideas and hypotheses and tries various means of verifying them. Further, knowledge is not simply derived from sensation—which gives immediate contact with the external world—as the original empiricists taught. It is essentially historical, the product of prolonged social practice and intricate modifications of thought in its adjustments to reality, which remain forever incomplete.

This is true of the dialectics of nature as well. It is not imposed a priori or wilfully upon nature, as Sartre charges. It represents the verified conclusions, the systematic formulations of practical experience, scientific investigation, and critical thought extending from Heraclitus to Hegel. Like other theoretical acquisitions, it is projected into the future as a guide to further inquiry into concrete reality.

But if Marxism has discarded the passive, oversimplified, and nonevolutionary versions of the thought process held by previous schools of materialism from Epicurus to the 18th-century sensationalists, it asserts with them that conceptual reflection does bring out and define the essential qualities and relations of things. Nature is prior to consciousness. There is an internal bond between what exists and what is known—and even how it is known. The order of ideas, as Benedict Spinoza said, does correspond with the order of things.

Hyppolite makes two charges against the Marxist interpretation of dialectics. On the one hand it aims to make nature historical by importing dialectical laws into it, and on the other it tries to “naturise” history by subjecting it to the same laws as the physical world. He wishes to keep history and nature in totally separate compartments.

This is alien to reality. Nature is through and through historical. Vigier emphasises how, “proceeding from the history of biology and the human sciences, the idea of evolution has step by step invaded the whole of the sciences: after astronomy it is today breaking through into chemistry and physics Ö This idea of history, of evolution, of analysis in terms of development is for us precisely the profound logical root of the dialectics of nature. It can even be said that in a sense all scientific progress is being achieved along the line of abandoning static descriptions for the sake of dynamic analyses combining the intrinsic properties of the analysed phenomena. For us, science progresses from Cuvier to Darwin, from the static to the dynamic, from formal logic to dialectical logic.”

Nature and society form two parts of a single historical process. But they are basically different, contradictory parts. Other living beings have history made for them; we make our own history.

Animals depend upon the available food and other features of their environment for survival; they cannot alter or discard their specialised organs and ways of life to cope with sudden changes. Entire species can perish when their habitats change too rapidly and radically. Humans, on the other hand, are not subjected to any particular environment or mode of adaptation. We can adjust to new conditions, meet changes, and even institute them by inventing new tools and techniques and producing what we need.

Up to now social development has carried over certain traits of natural development because by and large it has proceeded in an unconscious and uncontrolled manner. The course of society has been determined not by human purposes, but by the unintended results of the operation of the productive forces. But human history has reached the point where it can discard its blind automatism and enter an entirely different type of development. By discovering the laws of social development and collectively acting upon them, we can take control of society and consciously plan its further growth.

Hyppolite and Sartre accuse Marxism of instituting a new dogmatism by presenting a fixed and finished system of thought about the world. Hyppolite’s last words in the debate are: “You risk giving us a sort of dialectics, under the pretext of dialectics of nature, which would be a speculative (i.e., idealistic) thought, in certain respects a theological thought, even though you disclaim such an intention.” Sartre contends that Marxist dialectics is a frozen system based upon a limited number of laws, the three mentioned by Engels in _Dialectics of Nature_ .

Sartre is right in saying that the laws of logic are not limited. But so does genuine Marxism, even though some doctrinaires of the Stalinist school have sought to limit them. The French philosopher Henri Lefebvre ridiculed one official of the French Communist Party who smugly declared to him: “The house [of dialectical thought] is finished; there is nothing left to do but put up the tapestries.”

“There does not exist a closed, finished, definitive list of dialectical laws”, says Garaudy. “The presently known laws constitute a provisional balance sheet of our knowledge Ö Further social practice and scientific experiment will permit us to enrich and extend them.” Although the dialectical laws discovered and formulated to date have a definite content and universal scope, they are neither completed nor unchangeable. The number and the character of the laws of logic have changed over the past 2500 years. They will continue to be transformed along with the development of nature, society and knowledge.

Sartre strives to secure an objective basis for dialectics by locating it exclusively within human practice. “If we refuse to see the original dialectical movement in the individual and in his enterprise of producing his life, of objectifying himself, then we shall have to give up dialectic or else make of it the immanent law of history,” he writes in _Search for a Method_. This is a very misleading description of dialectical movement even within human history. The dialectical development of society proceeds not from the action and decision of the isolated individual in a concrete situation but from the work of the group, first in the struggle against nature, then in the conflict of classes. Subjective components of the whole—such as individual psychology—which so preoccupy the existentialists, are integral and subordinate elements of this objective historical process and derive their validity and significance from it.

In the reciprocal relationship whereby human practice transforms and masters the environment, nature retains existential priority, however much this offends the subjectivity of the existentialist philosopher.

The origin of human practice itself requires explanation. The distinctive activities that have separated humanity from the animal condition originated with the using and making of tools and weapons to obtain the means of subsistence. But this new kind of activity, which is at the foundation of society, grew out of natural processes which antedate human practice by billions of years.

In the evolutionary scale, animal activity preceded human practice, which was a qualitatively new offshoot of it. When the first fish developed lungs, came to live on dry land, and converted themselves into amphibians, that was a dialectical change in organic nature. Through the natural mechanisms of the evolution of species, the fish, to use Sartre’s language, “objectified himself” into something else.

The dialectics of human history grew out of this dialectics of nature. It originated in the conversion of the early primate into the human, the most meaningful of all the contradictory developments of matter. The elevation of humanity above animality was the greatest rupture in the continuity of nature’s evolution. The qualitative disjunction between us and other species is so deepgoing that Sartre takes it as the ground for excluding dialectics from nature.

He is here baffled by a genuine contradiction. Human beings are both creatures of nature and a departure from it. When the human is low-rated as nothing but a high-grade animal, different in degree but not in kind from other living beings, the essential and distinctive nature of humanity is obliterated. Human life, which stems from the production of the means of subsistence by tools and weapons, is something radically new compared with the animal foraging for food. The labour process is the beginning of society and provides the platform for the dialectical movement of history. Fundamental changes in the organisation of this labour process are the decisive steps in the further advancement of humanity.

But the processes which humanised our primate ancestors were both a prolongation of brute nature and a level above and beyond it. Just as there is both continuity and discontinuity in the transition from ape to human, so there is comparable continuity and discontinuity between the dialectics of nature and that of history. The dialectics of nature has different forms and proceeds according to different laws than the dialectics of social evolution. It is the prehistory of human dialectics, the precondition for it. The one passes over into the other as humanity has created its own characteristics in distinction from the rest of nature.

The evolution of human life through social practice is only the culminating chapter in the evolution of matter. The dialectic of human history, which for Sartre is the be-all and end-all of dialectics, is the latest episode in the universal dialectic.

Sartre’s subjectivist and anthropocentric conception of dialectical movement is belied by the latest finding of modern science. Scientists now say that billions of planets are suitable for the creation of life and may very likely be populated by intelligent organisms of some sort. There are 100 million eligible planets in our galaxy alone! Humanity is only one manifestation of life, inhabiting a small planet of a solar system on the edge of an ordinary galaxy in an explorable universe of billions of galaxies containing other—and in some cases higher—specimens of life.

This remarkable addition to our knowledge does not detract from the value and significance of life on earth for us. After all, the improvement of our own scientific practice and theory has led us to this insight. But it should serve to put our existence into proper cosmic proportion and perspective. Dialectics can no more be restricted to the people on our planet than life and intelligence can be.

The existentialist resents and rejects the rationalism and objectivity of science. It supposedly leads us away from real being, which is to be perpetually sought, though never reached, through the ever-renewed, ever-baffled effort of the individual consciousness to go beyond our human condition. The terrible destiny of the human race is like “the desire of the moth for the star/ the night for the morrow/ the devotion to something afar/ from the sphere of our sorrow”.

So the exasperated existentialist Sartre flings as his trump card against the dialectics of nature the current crisis in science. “There has never been, I believe, as grave a crisis as the present one in science”, he cries to Vigier. “So when you come to talk to us about your completed, formed, solid science and want to dissolve us in it, you’ll understand our reserve.”

Vigier calmly replies: “Science progresses by means of crises in the same manner as history; that’s what we call progress. Crises are the very foundation of progress.” And he concludes: “The very practice of science, its progress, the very manner in which it is today passing from a static to a dynamic analysis of the world, that is precisely what is progressively elaborating the dialectic of nature under our very eyes Ö The dialectic of nature is very simply the effort of the philosophy of our time Ö of the most encyclopedic philosophy, that is, Marxism to apprehend the world and change it.”

This ringing affirmation will appear bizarre to Anglo-American scientists who may respect Vigier for his work as a physicist. They summarily disqualify dialectical logic on the ground that, whatever its philosophical or political interest, it has no value in promoting any endeavour in natural science. If the method is valid, the antidialecticians say, then purposeful application by its proponents should prove capable of producing important new theories and practical results in other fields than the social. Marxists are challenged to cite instances where the dialectical method has actually led to new discoveries and not simply demonstrated after the fact that specific scientific findings conform to the generalisations of dialectical logic.

The most splendid contribution of this kind in recent decades has been Oparin’s theories on the origin of life, which are widely accepted and have stimulated fruitful work on the problems of biogenesis and genetics. The Soviet scientist’s theory is based on the hypothesis that the random formation and interaction of increasingly complex molecules gave rise to the simplest forms of living matter, which then began to reproduce at the expense of the surrounding organic material.

Oparin consciously employed such principles of materialist dialectics as the transformation of quantity into quality, the interruption of continuity (evolution by leaps), and the conversion of chance fluctuations into regular processes and definite properties of matter, to initiate an effective new line of approach to one of the central problems of science: How did inanimate nature generate life on earth? Such cases would undoubtedly multiply if more practicing scientists were better informed about the Marxist method of thought.

I I I

The crisis of method within science is only one aspect of the more general crisis of modern civilisation. This has become most excruciating in the deadly consequences of physical science under capitalist auspices. The dialectics of nature exhibited in the fission and fusion of atoms has merged with the dialectics of history in the most monstrous and momentous of all contradictions facing humanity: the threat of self-destruction by nuclear war.

Why have the immense strides in physical knowledge and technology designed to serve humankind become perverted into an intolerable menace to our survival? The H-bomb exemplifies the sociological law that the fast-expanding forces of production have outgrown capitalist relations and are pounding against them for liberation. Used for good or evil, nuclear energy, the greatest source of power at our command, is proving incompatible with private ownership of the economy and capitalist control over the government.

The imperative political conclusion is that the representatives of the money power in the United States must be prevented from pressing the button which can doom us all, as was nearly done in the 1962 missile crisis over Cuba. Capitalism is the last form of socioeconomic organisation dominated by laws which operate in an ungovernable way, like laws of nature. The aim of scientific socialism, the task of the proletarian world revolution, is to subdue all the anarchic forces tied up with capitalism which generate insecurity and havoc in our society. The blind drives of class society have pushed humanity to the brink of extinction. Conscious understanding and application of the dialectical laws of evolution—and revolution—can help save us.

Only through public ownership and operation of the economy and democratic direction of state policy can the working people introduce scientific enlightenment into the material foundations of life, overthrow the last entrenchment of automatism in social evolution, and clear the way for the rule of reason in all human affairs.

A COMMENT AND A RESPONSE

I have just read your article, “Is Nature Dialectical?” in the Summer 1964 issue of the _International Socialist Review_, and I was quite impressed by it.

Although I must plead guilty to a rather superficial knowledge of Marxism, I am very interested in Hegel’s work. During my study of Hegel, I have come to the conclusion that the question of the philosophy of nature is a crucial one. In my opinion, Hegel’s philosophy falls apart into a dualism of mind and matter instead of being the synthesis he desired just because of the failure of his philosophy of nature.

This failure is not, I submit, a failure of the dialectical method, but the result of the lack of sufficient scientific knowledge at Hegel’s time plus Hegel’s insistence on bending the inadequate knowledge he did have into his philosophic system. It is the latter fault that makes his philosophy of nature appear downright silly today; but it is only today that we are beginning to attain the scientific knowledge that makes a dialectical view of the facts the only reasonable one.

This part of Hegel’s philosophy has been largely neglected, but I consider it vital to a serious consideration of his thought today. Therefore, your article on the dialectics of nature was a very welcome piece of writing to me. On the whole, I agree with your position—the laws of dialectics apply to nature as well as humanity.

The scientific knowledge available now can only be understood thoroughly by the use of dialectics. This appears most obviously in the realm of evolution and biology in general, but the interrelationship of all aspects of our world means that it is applicable to the other sciences as well.

The existentialist position would create a complete alienation between man and the world, and would destroy the objectivity of our knowledge and thus our ability to act. Sartre’s position, as described in your article—that humans can never attain to the “reality” of things, that our knowledge and the laws of our (dialectical) logic apply only to humanity and society, etc.—sounds like that of a resuscitated Kant.

It can only lead to a divided world-view, a denial of the possibility of true knowledge and, ultimately, to excesses of subjectivity rather than creative activity. The existentialists may begin their philosophic inquiry from the standpoint of the individual, but that does not mean that they can stop there without losing sight of the essential thing—that we are in and of the world.

The points made by Vigier and Garaudy were, I felt, an excellent rebuttal to Sartre and Hyppolite. There is one point in your article, however, with which I would take some exception. That is when you argue against the antidialecticians by pointing out the advances made in science, especially by Oparin, through the use of dialectical method. Dialectical logic may help the scientist reach some useful hypotheses for later investigation, but this is not the essential point here.

It seems to me that the method or means by which scientific discoveries are made is secondary in this argument. What is really vital is the fact that only a dialectical view of nature can provide an adequate framework in which these new discoveries can be seen in their total relationship. That is, how one gets to the discovery is not so important as the realisation that this new “fact” can only be thoroughly explained and related to the rest of our knowledge through a dialectical viewpoint.

There is one other point that seems appropriate to this discussion: I read recently that Roger Garaudy was to write an introduction to a Russian translation of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s _Phenomenon of Man_. Now Teilhard certainly is not a dialectical materialist in any sense of the word. However, beneath the theological portion of his thought, one finds a view of evolution that is certainly dialectical—in a Hegelian, if not a Marxist, sense. And Teilhard’s work seems to have been a little too “materialistic” for the Roman Catholic church.

Teilhard’s work in itself deserves study, but simply in connection with the question of the dialectics of nature, it seems to me that it may be a sign that we are approaching a higher synthesis of thought. The static conceptions of “idealism” and “materialism” may give way to a newer, more adequate realisation of their interdependence throughout the whole sphere of nature. That can only be achieved if we recognise the objective character of dialectics—that it applies to nature as well as to history. The perpetuation of alienation between “mind” and “matter”, humanity and the world, nature and history, can serve no good purpose, but only leads to fragmentation and confusion in philosophy and action.

Dialectics by its nature has to be an “open” system which not only allows for the addition of new knowledge but also admits our freedom and ability to shape history. The recognition of nature as dialectical is the only way to a whole world-view that includes humanity in the world while recognising our unique position and frees us to control our own future. Your article is an excellent statement of the issues and their importance, and I hope it will precipitate in this country a greater appreciation of the problem and wide discussion of it.

_Yvonne Groseil_

Here are some comments on the main questions of theoretical interest raised by this friendly comment.

1. Would knowledge of the method of the materialist dialectic, which is based on the most general laws of being and becoming, assist physical scientists in their investigations of nature?

Up to now almost all scientists have carried on their work without conscious understanding of the dialectical laws of universal development, just as most people speak very well without knowing the history or grammar of their language, breathe without awareness of the physiological processes of respiration, and acquire the necessities of life without comprehending the principles of political economy.

Western philosophers and scientists almost unanimously believe that the dialectical view of nature is false, irrelevant, and even positively harmful in the theory and practice of science. This prejudice, rooted in our predominantly empirical and positivist intellectual traditions, has been reinforced by the arbitrary and ignorant interference of the Stalinist bureaucrats with scientific theory, along with their narrowly schematic, distorted, and dogmatic interpretation of Marxist method.

This correspondent has a more favourable attitude toward the dialectical conception of nature. But she suggests that it may be far less important in facilitating progress in physical science than it is for explaining and correlating its discoveries after they have been made.

Such a one-sided emphasis runs the risk of lapsing into the very Kantian dualism which she correctly criticises in the case of the existentialists. What are here involved are the organic connections between the unity of reality, the sum total of our knowledge, and the scientific inquiry which shuttles from one to the other. If the dialectical method can be useful in clarifying the relationships of the knowledge of nature once it has been acquired, why cannot it be equally valuable in helping scientists to arrive at verified results? After all, the dialectical characteristics which are disclosed in the body of known facts must already have existed and been effective in the objective realities from which they have been derived.

If scientists should approach the problems for which they seek solutions in their particular fields with an informed understanding of the fundamental traits of development formulated in the laws of dialectical logic, why couldn’t these serve as a general methodological guide in their concrete inquiries?

In fact, the most creative scientists have assumed the truth of this or that rule of dialectical logic in conducting their work, although they have done so in a piecemeal, haphazard, semiconscious manner. Without referring to past examples, let’s take the many non-Marxist scientists around the world who are cooperating with Oparin in studying the specific steps by which the most elementary processes and mechanisms of life have emerged from inanimate matter. Unlike him, they pay no heed to the fact that the transition of the lifeless into the living exemplifies at least two laws of dialectical logic.

One is the unity of opposites, which states that A equals non-A; the other is the transformation of quantity into quality. That is to say, a sufficient aggregate of chemical reactions of a special type gave rise to new properties appropriate to a new and higher state of material existence on this planet, the biochemical level, of which humans are the most complex and advanced embodiment.

Just as Teilhard de Chardin’s religious views did not prevent him from participating in the discovery of Peking Man in 1929 and thus adding to our knowledge of human origins, so practicing physicists, chemists, and biologists can and do promote their sciences without any clear notions of the logic underlying their investigations, or even with erroneous ideas of the world. But would not the work of individual scientists benefit—as much as science as a whole—if they could rid their minds of errors and inconsistencies which run counter to a scientific outlook, and thus bring their general ideas about the universe and their logical theory into closer accord with their experimental practice and the requirements of science itself?

That is why Marxists contend that a comprehensive grasp of the logic of dialectical materialism would not only clarify what science has already achieved but enable contemporary scientists to promote and improve their work. Science is still in its infancy and is only now being applied on a grand scale. There are more scientists in the world today than in all previous history. This sudden and sharp jump in the number of scientists and the facilities at their disposal demands a corresponding expansion in their understanding of the logic of evolution, which so far has been best provided by the school of dialectical materialism.

2. The works of Father Teilhard de Chardin can throw light on this matter, although not entirely in the way intended by our correspondent. While Chardin is an inconsistent dialectician, he is not at all a materialist in his philosophy and procedure. One of the world’s most eminent biologists, George Gaylord Simpson, who was a friend of Chardin’s and has read both his published and unpublished manuscripts, concurs with this judgment in his book _This View of Life_. There, in a chapter entitled “Evolutionary Theology: the New Mysticism”, Simpson states that Chardin’s ideas are mystical and nonscientific in two major respects. First, he divides all energy into two distinct kinds which cannot be verified: a “tangential” material energy and a “radial” spiritual energy. Second, he advocates orthogenesis as the principal mechanism of evolution. Unlike natural selection, which is based upon random and multidirectional trends of evolution, orthogenesis holds that evolution proceeds in a unidirectional, predetermined, and even purposive manner.

Simpson severely censures Chardin for his spiritualistic “doubletalk”, which really has nothing to do with science. He writes that “Teilhard was _primarily_ a Christian mystic and only secondarily a scientist”.

Roger Garaudy likewise deals with Chardin in his book _Perspectives of Man_. Ironically, this foremost French communist philosopher is far more conciliatory toward the views of the Jesuit father than is the American biologist Simpson. Garaudy’s book undertakes a critical analysis of the main currents of contemporary French thought: existentialism, Catholicism, and Marxism. He claims that all three are engaged in a common effort to grasp “man in his totality”, and he seeks to emphasise their “possible convergences”. He concludes that radical existentialists, liberal Catholics, and communists can cooperate “not as adversaries but as explorers in a common venture” which proceeds by different paths toward the same goal.

This theoretical position is the reverse of that taken by Garaudy in the days of Stalin-Zhdanov. It is motivated by the desire for a philosophical rapprochement among these incompatible schools of thought to accompany the CP’s quest for a political alliance of all “democratic, progressive, peace-loving” forces as prescribed by the policy of “peaceful coexistence”.

Those unorthodox features of Chardin’s thought, which scandalise his superiors in the Jesuit order and the church but attract liberal Catholics, lend themselves to this purpose. It is true, as Garaudy points out, that Chardin recognised certain dialectical characteristics in the process of evolution, such as the universal interconnection and reciprocal action of all things, the transformation of quantity into quality in connection with biogenesis (though not in the transition from biological to social life), and the transmutation of matter in an ascending series of higher forms.

But the “finalism” and “vitalism” which permeate his thought—based on the supposition that evolution heads in only one direction, toward greater “centro-complexity”, toward the Omega point where humanity will merge with God—are irreconcilable not only with dialectical materialism but, as Simpson insists, with any acceptable scientific approach to universal evolution.

3. Somewhat in the spirit of Chardin, Yvonne Groseil intimates that “the static conceptions of ‘idealism’ and ‘materialism’ may give way to a newer, more adequate realisation of their interdependence throughout the whole sphere of nature.” A Marxist cannot agree with this for numerous reasons.

First, there is nothing “static” about a consistently dialectical and materialist view of nature, which is based upon the proposition that everything is in flux because of the opposing forces at work within it and in the universe. Materialist dialectics is dynamic, mobile, evolutionary through and through.

Second, the valid and valuable contributions made to the store of human knowledge by the great idealists of the past (like dialectical logic itself) have been—or ought to be—incorporated into the structure of dialectical materialism without surrendering or compromising its fundamental positions: that reality consists of matter in motion, and that social life and intellectuality are the highest manifestations of the development of matter.

Idealism, on the other hand, makes spiritual, supernatural, ideological, or personal forces the essence of reality. Such a fundamentally false philosophy has to be rejected in toto.

Nor can these two opposing conceptions of the world and its evolution be amalgamated into some superior synthesis eclectically combining the “best features of both”, as Sartre tries to do with his neo-Marxist existentialism and Father de Chardin in his blend of religious mysticism and evolutionism.

Modern thought and science can be most effectively advanced through a firm repudiation of all religious, mystical, and idealistic notions and the conscious adoption, application, and development of dialectical materialism. Working in equal partnership, Marxist logic and the sciences can enable us to penetrate more surely and deeply into the nature of the world we live in.

After finishing this reply, I chanced to read “The Emergence of Evolutionary Novelties” by Ernst Mayr, Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard, in _The Evolution of Life_. It deals with the key problem of explaining the origin of entirely new biological phenomena on the basis of random variations.

Mayr points out that “the exact definition of an ‘evolutionary novelty’ faces the same insuperable difficulty as the definition of the species. As long as we believe in gradual evolution, we must be prepared to encounter mediate evolutionary stages. Equivalent to the cases in which it is impossible to decide whether a population is not yet a species or already a species, will be cases of doubt as to whether a population is already or not yet an evolutionary novelty. The study of this difficult transition from the quantitative to the qualitative is precisely one of the objects of this paper.”

Mayr finds that there are three main kinds of evolutionary novelties: cellular biochemical innovations (the uric acid and fat metabolism of the cleidoic egg of the terrestrial vertebrates); new structures (eyes, wings, stings); and new habits or behaviour patterns (the shift from water to land or from the earth to air).

The saltationists and mutationists of various schools argued against the natural selectionists that new structures could only have come into existence suddenly and all ready for advantageous use, whereas Charles Darwin held that they would have to be formed by numerous, successive, and slight modifications of preexisting organs. “The problem of the emergence of evolutionary novelties”, writes Mayr, “then consists in having to explain how a sufficient number of small gene mutations can be accumulated until the new structure has become sufficiently large to have selective value.” He calls this the “threshold problem”.

His paper undertakes to demonstrate the ways in which different organisms have actually effected the changeover from one structure to another in the evolutionary process. Mayr’s treatment is highly pertinent to our own discussion of logical method in science because it indicates how a biologist concerned with the fundamental problem of evolution has been impelled to invoke the dialectical law of the transformation of quantity into quality in order to explain the generation of novelty in living beings.

Indeed, how would it be possible to comprehend how the mere piling up of quantitative variations could give rise to something decisively different from its antecedents unless this law was operative?

It may be objected that Mayr has not used this law to discover anything new but only to clarify how new biological phenomena come into existence. But, as John Dalton’s atomic theory of the chemical elements, Darwin’s theory of evolution, and Max Planck’s quantum theory testify, the discovery of the general laws at work, the basic features and essential relations in any field of reality, is the highest expression of scientific activity. A correct and comprehensive conception of the production of novelty in organic evolution is more important for the advancement and reinforcement of biological science than the discovery of some new aspect of functional adaptation to a habitat by a particular group of fauna.

Mayr is one of the most eminent of contemporary American biologists. It can be assumed that he is not a Marxist or an adherent of dialectical materialism. He has resorted to one of the major laws of dialectics empirically, without a full awareness of the type of logical thinking he was applying, just as another naturalist of lesser stature might explore a novel type of adaptation of a group of organisms without concerning himself about a general explanation of evolutionary novelty as Mayr had done.

Mayr’s acknowledgment of the indispensability of this law of dialectics in solving the problem of the emergence of evolutionary novelties provides involuntary and forceful testimony to its value for the natural scientist.

#### Dialectics

##### A. General Questions at Dialectics. The Fundamental Laws of Dialectics

Dialectics, so-called _objective_ dialectics, prevails throughout nature, and so-called subjective dialectics, dialectical thought, is only the reflection of the motion through opposites which asserts itself everywhere in nature, and which by the continual conflict of the opposites and their final passage into one another, or into higher forms, determines the life of nature. Attraction and repulsion. Polarity begins with magnetism, it is exhibited in one and the same body; in the case of electricity it distributes itself over two or more bodies which become oppositely charged. All chemical processes reduce themselves – to processes of chemical attraction and repulsion. Finally, in organic life the formation of the cell nucleus is likewise to be regarded as a polarisation of the living protein material, and from the simple cell – onwards the theory of evolution demonstrates how each advance up to the most complicated plant on the one side, and up to man on the other, is effected by the continual conflict between heredity and adaptation. In this connection it becomes evident how little applicable to such forms of evolution are categories like “positive” and “negative.” One can conceive of heredity as the positive, conservative side, adaptation as the negative side that continually destroys what has been inherited, but one can just as well take adaptation as the creative, active, positive activity, and heredity as the resisting, passive, negative activity. But just as in history progress makes its appearance as the negation of the existing state of things, so here also – on purely practical grounds – adaptation is better conceived as negative activity. In history, motion through opposites is most markedly exhibited in all critical epochs of the foremost peoples. At such moments a people has only the choice between the two horns of a dilemma: “either-or!” and indeed the question is always put in a way quite different from that in which the philistines, who dabble in politics in every age, would have liked it put. Even the liberal German philistine of 1848 found himself in 1849 suddenly, unexpectedly, and against his will confronted by the question: a return to the old reaction in an intensified form, or continuance of the revolution up to the republic, perhaps even the one and indivisible republic with a socialist background. He did not spend long in reflection and helped to create the Manteuffel reaction as the flower of German liberalism. Similarly, in 1851, the French bourgeois when faced with the dilemma which he certainly did not expect: a caricature of the empire, pretorian rule, and the exploitation of France by a gang of scoundrels, or a social-democratic republic – and he bowed down before the going of scoundrels so as to be able, under their protection, to go on exploiting the workers.

_Hard and fast lines_ are incompatible with the theory of evolution. Even the border-line between vertebrates and invertebrates is now no longer rigid, just as little is that between fishes and amphibians, while that between birds and reptiles dwindles more and more every day. Between Compsognathus[[156]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n156) and _Archaopteryx_ only a few intermediate links are wanting, and birds’ beaks with teeth crop up in both hemispheres. “Either-or” becomes more and more inadequate. Among lower animals the concept of the individual cannot be established at all sharply. Not only as to whether a particular animal is an individual or a colony, but also where in development one individual ceases and the other begins (nurses).[[157]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n157)

For a stage in the outlook on nature where all differences become merged in intermediate steps, and all opposites pass into one another through intermediate links, the old metaphysical method of thought no longer suffices. Dialectics, which likewise knows no hard and fast lines, no unconditional**,** universally valid “either-or” and which bridges the fixed metaphysical differences, and besides “either-or” recognises also in the right place “both this-and that” and reconciles the opposites, is the sole method of thought appropriate in the highest degree to this stage. Of course, for everyday use, for the small change of science, the metaphysical categories retain their validity.

### * * *

The transformation of quantity into quality=“mechanical” world outlook, quantitative change alters quality. The gentlemen never suspected that!

### * * *

The character of mutual opposites belonging to the thought determinations of reason: polarisation. Just as electricity, magnetism, etc., become polarised and move in opposites, so do thoughts. Just as in the former it is not possible to maintain any one-sidedness, and no natural scientist would think of doing so, so also in the latter.

### * * *

The true nature of the determinations of “essence” is expressed by Hegel himself (_Enzyklopädie,_ I, paragraph III, addendum): “In essence everything is _relative_” (e.g., positive and negative, which have meaning only in their relation, not each for itself).

### * * *

Part and whole, for instance, are already categories which become inadequate in organic nature. The ejection of seeds – the embryo – and the new-born animal are not to be conceived as a “part” that is separated from the “whole”; that would give a distorted treatment. It becomes a part only in a dead body. (_Enzyklopädie_, I, p. 268.)[[158]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n158)

### * * *

_Simple and compound._ Categories which even in organic nature likewise lose their meaning and become inapplicable. An animal is expressed neither by its mechanical composition from bones, blood, gristle, muscles, tissues, etc., .nor by its chemical composition from the elements. Hegel (_Enzyklopädie_, I, p. 256).[[159]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n159) The organism is _neither_ simple _nor_ compound, however complex it may be.

### * * *

_Abstract identity_ (_a=a_; and negatively, _a_ cannot be simultaneously equal and unequal to _a_) is likewise inapplicable in organic nature. The plant, the animal, every cell is at every moment of its life identical with itself and yet becoming distinct from itself, by absorption and excretion of substances, by respiration, by cell formation and death of cells, by the process of circulation taking place, in short, by a sum of incessant molecular changes which make up life and the sum-total of whose results is evident to our eyes in the phases of life – embryonic life, youth, sexual maturity, process of reproduction, old age, death. The further physiology develops, the more important for it become these incessant, infinitely small changes, and hence the more important for it also the consideration of difference _within_ identity, and the old abstract standpoint of formal identity, that an organic being is to be treated as something simply identical with itself, as something constant, becomes out of date. [In the margin of the manuscript occurs the remark: “Apart, moreover, from the evolution of species.”] Nevertheless, the mode of thought based thereon, together with its categories, persists. But even in inorganic nature identity as such is in reality non-existent. Every body is continually exposed to mechanical, physical, and chemical influences, which are always changing it and modifying its identity. Abstract identity, with its opposition to difference, is in place only in mathematics – an abstract science which is concerned with creations of thought, even though they are reflections of reality – and even there it is continually being sublated. Hegel, _Enzyklopädie_, I, p. 235.[[160]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n160) The fact that identity contains difference within itself is expressed in _every sentence,_ where the predicate is necessarily different from the subject; the lily is a _plant,_ the _rose, is red,_ where, either in the subject or in the predicate, there is something that is not covered by the predicate or the subject. Hegel, p. 231.[[161]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n161) That from the outset _identity with itself_ requires _difference from everything else_ as its complement, is self-evident.

Continual change, i.e., sublation of abstract identity with itself, is also found in so-called inorganic nature. Geology is its history. On the surface, mechanical changes (denudation, frost), chemical changes (weathering); internally, mechanical changes (pressure), heat (volcanic), chemical (water, acids, binding substances); on a large scale – upheavals, earthquakes, etc. The slate of today is fundamentally different from the ooze from which it is formed, the chalk from the loose microscopic shells that compose it, even more so limestone, which indeed according to some is of purely organic origin, and sandstone from the loose sea sand, which again is derived from disintegrated granite, etc., not to speak of coal.

### * * *

_The law of identity_ in the old metaphysical sense is the fundamental law of the old outlook: _a=a._ Each thing is equal to itself. Everything was permanent, the solar system, stars, organisms. This law has been refuted by natural science bit by bit in each separate case, but theoretically it still prevails and is still put forward by the supporters of the old in opposition to the new: a thing cannot simultaneously be itself and something else. And yet the fact that true, concrete identity includes difference, change, has recently been shown in detail by natural science (see above).

Abstract identity, like all metaphysical categories, suffices for _everyday_ use, where small dimensions or brief periods of time are in question; the limits within which it is usable differ in almost every case and are determined by the nature of the object; for a planetary system, where in ordinary astronomical calculation the ellipse can be taken as the basic form for practical purposes without error, they are much wider than for an insect that completes its metamorphosis in a few weeks. (Give other examples, e.g., alteration of species, which is reckoned in periods of thousands of years.) For natural science in its comprehensive role, however, even in each single branch, abstract identity is totally inadequate, and although on the whole it has now been abolished in practice, theoretically it still dominates people’s minds, and most natural scientists imagine that identity and difference are irreconcilable opposites, instead of one-sided poles which represent the truth only in their reciprocal action, in the inclusion of difference within identity.

### * * *

Identity and difference – necessity and chance – cause and effect – the two main opposites [In the manuscript: “die beiden Hauptgegensatze” (the two main opposites). Engels has in mind: (1) The antithesis of identity and difference, and (2) the antithesis of cause and effect. The words “necessity and chance” were written between the lines afterwards.] which, treated separately, become transformed into one another.

And then “first principles” must help.

### * * *

_Positive and negative._ Can also be given the reverse names: in electricity, etc.; North and South ditto. If one reverses this and alters the rest of the terminology accordingly, everything remains correct. We can call West East and East West. The sun rises in the West, and planets revolve from East to West, etc., the names alone are changed. Indeed, in physics we call the real South pole of the magnet, which is attracted by the North pole, of the earth’s magnetism, the _North pole,_ and it does not matter.

### * * *

That positive and negative are equivalent, irrespective of which side is positive and which negative, (holds good) not only in analytical geometry, but still more in physics (see Clausius, p. 87 et seq.).[[162]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n162)

### * * *

_Polarity. A_ magnet, on being cut through, polarises the neutral middle portion, but in such a way that the old poles remain. On the other hand a worm, on being cut into two, retains the receptive mouth at the positive pole and forms a new negative pole at the other end with excretory anus; but the old negative pole (the anus) now becomes positive, becoming a mouth, and a new anus or negative pole is formed at the cut end. Voila transformation of positive into negative.

### * * *

_Polarisation._ For J. Grimm it was still a firmly established law that a German dialect must be either High German or Low German. In this he totally lost sight of the Frankish dialect.[[163]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n163) Because the written Frankish of the later Carlovingian period was High German (since the High German shifting of consonants had taken possession of the Frankish South-East), he imagined that Frankish passed in one place into old High German, in another place into French. It then remained absolutely impossible to explain the source of the Netherland dialect in the ancient Salic regions. Frankish was only rediscovered after Grimm’s death: Salic in its rejuvenation as the Netherland dialect, Ripuaric in the Middle and Lower Rhine dialects, which in part have been shifted to various stages of High German, and in part have remained Low German, so that Frankish is a dialect that is _both_ High German and Low German.

### * * *

##### Chance and Necessity

Another opposition in which metaphysics is entangled is that of chance and necessity. What can be more sharply contradictory than these two thought determinations? How is it possible that both are identical, that the accidental is necessary, and the necessary is also accidental? Common sense, and with it the majority of natural scientists, treats necessity and chance as determinations that exclude each other once for all. A thing, a circumstance, a process is either accidental or necessary, but not both. Hence both exist side by side in nature; nature contains all sorts of objects and processes, of which some are accidental, the others necessary, and it is only a matter of not confusing the two sorts with each other. Thus, for instance, one assumes the decisive specific characters to be necessary, other differences between individuals of the same species being termed accidental, and this holds good of crystals as it does for plants and animals. Then again the lower group becomes accidental in relation to the higher, so that it is declared to be a matter of chance how many different species are included in the genus _felis_ or _equus,_ or how many genera and orders there are in a class, and how many individuals of each of these species exist, or how many different species of animals occur in a given region, or what in general the fauna and flora are like. And then it is declared that the necessary is the sole thing of scientific interest and that the accidental is a matter of indifference to science. That is to say: what can be brought under laws, hence what one _knows,_ is interesting; what cannot be brought under laws, and therefore what one does not know, is a matter of indifference and can be ignored. Thereby all science comes to an end, for it has to investigate precisely that which we do not know. That is to say: what can be brought under general laws is regarded as necessary, and what cannot be so brought as accidental. Anyone can see that this is the same sort of science as that which proclaims natural what it can explain, and ascribes what it cannot explain to supernatural causes; whether I term the cause of the inexplicable chance, or whether I term it God, is a matter of complete indifference as far as the thing itself is concerned. Both are only equivalents for: I do not know, and therefore do not belong to science. The latter ceases where the requisite connection is wanting.

In opposition to this view there is determinism, which passed from French materialism into natural science, and which tries to dispose of chance by denying it altogether. According to this conception only simple, direct necessity prevails in nature. That a particular pea-pod contains five peas and not four or six, that a particular dog’s tail is five inches long and not a whit longer or shorter, that this year a particular clover flower was fertilised by a bee and another not, and indeed by precisely one particular bee and at a particular time, that a particular windblown dandelion seed has sprouted and another not, that last night I was bitten by a flea at four o’clock in the morning, and not at three or five o’clock, and on the right shoulder and not on the left calf – these are all facts which have been produced by an irrevocable concatenation of cause and effect, by an unshatterable necessity of such a nature indeed that the gaseous sphere, from which the solar system was derived, was already so constituted that these events had to happen thus and not otherwise. With this kind of necessity we likewise do not get away from the theological conception of nature. Whether with Augustine and Calvin we call it the eternal decree of God, or Kismet[[164]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n164) as the Turks do, or whether we call it necessity, is all pretty much the same. for science. There is no question of tracing the chain of causation in any of these cases; so we are just as wise in one as in another, the so-called necessity remains an empty phrase, and with it – chance also remains – what it was before. As long as we are not able to show on what the number of peas in the pod depends, it remains just a matter of chance, and the assertion that the case was foreseen already in the primordial constitution of the solar system does not get us a step further. Still more. A science which was to set about the task of following back the _casus_ of this individual pea-pod in its causal concatenation would be no longer science but pure trifling; for this same peapod alone has in addition innumerable other individual, accidentally appearing qualities: shade of colour, thickness and hardness of the pod, size of the peas, not to speak of the individual peculiarities revealed by the microscope. The _one_ pea-pod, therefore, would already provide more causal connections for following up than all the botanists in the world could solve.

Hence chance is not here explained by necessity, but rather necessity is degraded to the production of what is merely accidental. If the fact that a particular pea-pod contains six peas, and not five or seven, is of the same order as the law of motion of the solar system, or the law of the transformation of energy, then as a matter of fact chance is not elevated into necessity, but rather necessity degraded into chance. Furthermore, however much the diversity of the organic and inorganic species and individuals existing side by side in a given area may be asserted to be based on irrefragable necessity, for the separate species and individuals it remains what it was before, a matter of chance. For the individual animal it is a matter of chance, where it happens to be born, what environment it finds for living, what enemies and how many of them threaten it. For the mother plant it is a matter of chance whither the wind scatters its seeds, and, for the daughter plant, where the seed finds soil for germination; and to assure us that here also everything rests on irrefragable necessity is a poor consolation. The jumbling together of natural objects in a given region, still more in the whole world, for all the primordial determination from eternity, remains what it was before – a matter of chance.

In contrast to both conceptions, Hegel came forward with the hitherto quite unheard-of propositions that the accidental has a cause because it is accidental, and just as much also has no cause because it is accidental; that the accidental is necessary, that necessity determines itself as chance, and, on the other hand, this chance is rather absolute necessity. (_Logik_, II, Book III, _2: Reality._) Natural science has simply ignored these propositions as paradoxical trifling, as self-contradictory nonsense, and, as regards theory, has persisted on the one hand in the barrenness of thought of Wolffian metaphysics, according to which a thing is _either_ accidental _or_ necessary, but not both at once; or, on the other hand, in the hardly less thoughtless mechanical determinism which in words denies chance in general only to recognise it in practice in each particular case.

While natural science continued to think in this way, what _did it do_ in the person of Darwin?

Darwin in his epoch-making work,[[165]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n165) set out from the widest existing basis of chance. Precisely the infinite, accidental differences between individuals within a single species, differences which become accentuated until they break through the character of the species, and whose immediate causes even can be demonstrated only in extremely few cases, compelled him to question the previous basis of all regularity in biology, viz., the concept of species in its previous metaphysical rigidity and unchangeability. Without the concept of species, however, all science was nothing. All its branches needed the concept of species as basis: human anatomy and comparative anatomy – embryology, zoology, palaeontology, botany, etc., what were they without the concept of species? All their results were not only put in question but directly set aside. Chance overthrows necessity, as conceived hitherto. [Note in the margin of the manuscript: “The material on chance occurrences accumulated in the meantime has suppressed and shattered the old idea of necessity.”] The previous idea of necessity breaks down. To retain it means dictatorially to impose on nature as a law a human arbitrary determination that is in contradiction to itself and to reality, it means to deny thereby all inner necessity in living nature, it means generally to proclaim the chaotic kingdom of chance to be the sole law of living nature.

“_Gilt nichts mehr der Tausves_ Jontof,”[[166]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n166) cried out quite logically the biologists of all schools.

##### B) Dialectical Logic and the Theory of Knowledge.  
On the “Limits of Knowledge”

### * * *

_Unity of nature and mind_. To the Greeks it was self-evident that nature could not be unreasonable, but even today the stupidest empiricists prove by their reasoning (however wrong it may be) that they are convinced from the outset that nature cannot be unreasonable or reason contrary to nature.

### * * *

The evolution of a concept, or of a conceptual relation (positive and negative, cause and effect, substance and accidency) in the history of thought, is related to its development in the mind of the individual dialectician, just as the evolution of an organism in palaeontology is related to its development in embryology (or rather in history and in the single embryo). That this is so was first discovered for concepts by Hegel. In historical development, chance plays its part, which in dialectical thinking, as in the development of the embryo, _is summed up in necessity_.

### * * *

_Abstract and concrete_. The general law of the change of form of motion is much more concrete than any single “concrete” example of it.

### * * *

_Understanding and reason_. This Hegelian distinction, according to which only dialectical thinking is reasonable, has a definite meaning. We have in common with animals all activity of the understanding: _induction, deduction_, and hence also _abstraction_ (Dido’s,[[169]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n169) generic concepts: quadrupeds and bipeds), _analysis_ of unknown objects (even the cracking of a nut is a beginning of analysis), _synthesis_ (in animal tricks), and, as the union of both, _experiment_ (in the case of new obstacles and unfamiliar situations). In their nature all these modes of procedure – hence all means of scientific investigation that ordinary logic recognises – are absolutely the same in men and higher animals. They differ only in degree (of development of the method in each case) The basic features of the method are the same and lead to the same results in man and animals, so long as both operate or make shift, merely with these elementary methods.

On the other hand, dialectical thought – precisely because it presupposes investigations of the nature, of concepts themselves – is only possible for man, and for him only at a comparatively high stage of development (Buddhists and Greeks), and it attains its full development much later still through modern philosophy – and yet we have the colossal results already among the Greeks which by far anticipate investigation!

### * * *

##### On the Classification of Judgments

Dialectical logic, in contrast to the old, merely formal logic, is not, like the latter, content with enumerating the forms of motion of thought, i.e., the various forms of judgment and conclusion, and placing them side by side without any connection. On the contrary, it derives these forms out of one another, it makes one subordinate to another instead of putting them on an equal level, it develops the higher forms out of the lower. Faithful to his division. of the whole of logic, Hegel groups judgments as:[[Den økonomiske konjunktur og den internationale arbejderbevægelse-1721249170794.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n170)

1. Judgment of inherence, the simplest form of judgment, in which a general property is affirmatively or negatively predicated of a single thing (positive judgment: the rose is red; negative judgment: the rose is not blue; infinite judgment: the rose is not a camel);

2. Judgment of subsumption, in which a relation determination is predicated of the subject (singular judgment: this man is mortal; particular judgment: some, many men are mortal; universal judgment: all men are mortal, or man is mortal);[[171]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n171)

3. Judgment of necessity, in which its substantial determination is predicated of the subject (categorical judgment: the rose is a plant; hypothetical judgment**:** when the sun rises it is day-time; disjunctive judgment: _Lepidosiren_ is either a fish or an amphibian);

4. Judgment of the notion, in which is predicated of the subject how far it corresponds to its general nature or, as Hegel says, to the notion of it (assertoric judgment: this house is bad; problematic judgment: if a house is constituted in such and such a way, it is good apodeictic judgment: the house that is constituted in such and such a way is good.

1. _Individual Judgment. 2_ and 3. _Special_. 4. _General_.

However dry this sounds here, and however arbitrary at first sight this classification of judgments may here and there appear, yet the inner truth and necessity of this grouping will become clear to anyone who studies the brilliant exposition in Hegel’s _Larger Logic_. (Works, V, pp. 63-115.) [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n172) To show how much this grouping is based not only on the laws of thought but also on the laws of nature, we should like to put forward here a very wellknown example outside this connection.

That friction produces heat was already known practically to prehistoric man, who discovered the making of fire by friction perhaps more than 100,000 years ago, and who still earlier warmed cold parts of the body by rubbing. But from that to the discovery that friction is in general a source of heat, who knows how many thousands of years elapsed? Enough that the time came when the human brain was sufficiently developed to be able to formulate the judgment: _friction is a source of heat_, a judgment of inherence, and indeed a positive one.

Still further thousands of years passed until, in 1842, Mayer, Joule, and Colding investigated this special process in its relation to other processes of a similar kind that had been discovered in the meantime, i.e., as regards its immediate general conditions, and formulated the judgment: _all mechanical motion is capable of being converted into heat by means of friction_. So much time and an enormous amount of empirical knowledge were required before we could make the advance in knowledge of the object from the above positive judgment of inherence to this ‘universal judgment of subsumption.

But from now on things went quickly. Only three years later, Mayer was able, at least in substance, to raise the judgment of subsumption to the level at which it now stands: _any form of motion, under conditions fixed for each case, is both able and compelled to undergo transformation, indirectly, into any other form of motion_ – a judgment of the notion, and moreover an apodeictic one, the highest form of judgment altogether.

What, therefore, in Hegel appears as a development of the thought form of judgment as such, confronts us here as, the development of our empirically based theoretical knowledge of the nature of motion in general. This shows, however, that laws of thought and laws of nature are necessarily in agreement with one another, if only they are correctly known.

We can regard the first judgment as that of individuality; the isolated fact that friction produces heat is registered. The second judgment is that of particularity: a special form of motion, mechanical motion, exhibits the property, under special conditions (through friction), of passing into another special form of motion, viz., heat. The third judgment is that of universality: any form of motion proves able and compelled to undergo transformation into any other form of motion. In this form the law attains its final expression. By new discoveries we can give new illustrations of it, we can give it a new and richer content. But we cannot add anything to the law itself as here formulated. In its universality, equally universal in form and content, it is not susceptible of further extension: it is an absolute law of nature.

Unfortunately we are in a difficulty about the form of motion of protein, alias life, so long as we are not able to make protein.

### * * *

Above, however, it has also been proved that to make judgments involves not merely Kant’s “power of judgment,” but a [This unfinished note closes the fourth page of the double sheet of which the second and third pages and the beginning of the fourth page constitute the preceding large fragment on the classification of judgments. Engels apparently meant to finish the note by counterposing his thesis on the empirical basis of all knowledge to the Kantian apriorism.]

### * * *

Individuality, particularity, universality – these are the three determinations in which the whole “Doctrine of the Notion”[[173]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n173) moves. Under these heads, progression from the individual to the particular and from the particular to the universal takes place not in one but in many modalities, and this is often enough exemplified by Hegel as the progression: individual, species, genus. And now the Haeckels come forward with their induction and trumpet it as a great fact – against Hegel – that progression must be from the individual to the particular and then to the universal (!), from the individual to the species and then to the genus – and then permit _deductive_ conclusions which are supposed to lead further. These people have got into such a dead lock over the opposition between induction and deduction that they reduce all logical forms of conclusion to these two, and in so doing do not notice that they (1) unconsciously employ quite different forms of conclusion under those names, (2) deprive themselves of the whole wealth of forms of conclusion in so far as it cannot be forced under these two, and (3) thereby convert both forms, induction and deduction, into sheer nonsense.

### * * *

_Induction and deduction._ Haeckel, p. 75 et seq., where Goethe draws the inductive conclusion that man, who _does not normally have_ a premaxillary bone, _must_ have one, hence by _incorrect_ induction arrives at something correct![[174]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n174)

### * * *

Haeckel’s nonsense: induction against deduction. As if it were not the case that deduction=conclusion, and therefore induction is also a deduction. This comes from polarisation. Haeckel’s _Schopfungsgeschichte_, pp. 76-77. The conclusion polarised into induction and deduction!

### * * *

By induction it was discovered 100 years ago **that cray**fish and spiders were insects and all lower animals were worms. By induction it has now been found that this is nonsense and there exist x classes. Wherein then lies the advantage of the so-called inductive conclusion, which can be just as false as the so-called deductive conclusion, the basis of which is nevertheless classification?

Induction can never prove that there will never be a mammal without lacteal glands. Formerly nipples were the mark of a mammal. But the platypus has none.

The whole swindle of induction (is derived) from the Englishmen; Whewell, inductive sciences, comprising the purely mathematical [sciences],[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n175) and so the antithesis to deduction invented. Logic, old or new, knows nothing of this. All forms of conclusion that start from the individual are experimental and based on experience, indeed the inductive conclusion even starts from U–I–P [[176]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n176) (universal).

It is also characteristic of the thinking capacity of our natural scientists that Haeckel fanatically champions induction at the very moment when the _results_ of induction – the classifications – are everywhere put in question (_Limulus_ a spider, _Ascidia_ a vertebrate or _chordate,_ the _Dipnoi,_ however, being fishes,[[177]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n177) in opposition to all original definitions of amphibia) and daily new facts are being discovered which overthrow the _entire_ previous classification by induction. What a beautiful confirmation of Hegel’s thesis that the inductive conclusion is essentially a problematic one! Indeed, owing to the theory of evolution, even the whole classification of organisms has been taken away from induction and brought back to “deduction,” to descent – one species being literally _deduced_ from another by descent – and it is impossible to prove the theory of evolution by induction alone, since it is quite anti-inductive. The concepts with which induction operates: species, genus, class, have been rendered fluid by the theory of evolution and so have become _relative:_ but one cannot use relative concepts for induction.

### * * *

_To the Pan-Inductionists._ [In the manuscript: “Den Allinduktionisten,” i.e., to those who regard induction as the only correct method.] With all the induction in the world we would never have got to the point of becoming clear about the _process_ of induction. Only the _analysis_ of this process could accomplish this. – Induction and deduction belong together as necessarily as synthesis and analysis. [Note in the margin: “Chemistry, in which analysis is the predominant form of investigation, is nothing without its opposite – synthesis.] Instead of one-sidedly lauding one to the skies at the expense of the other, we should seek to apply each of them in its place, and that can only be done by bearing in mind that they belong together, that they supplement each other.

According to the inductionists, induction is an infallible method. It is so little so that its apparently surest results are every day overthrown by new discoveries. Light corpuscles and caloric were results of induction. Where are they now? Induction taught us that all vertebrates have a central nervous system differentiated into brain and spinal cord, and that the spinal cord is enclosed in cartilaginous or bony vertebrae – whence indeed the name is derived. Then _Amphioxus_ was revealed as a vertebrate with an undifferentiated central nervous strand and _without_ vertebrae. Induction established that fishes are those vertebrates which throughout life breathe exclusively by means of gills. Then animals come to light whose fish character is almost universally recognised, but which, besides gills, have also well-developed lungs, and it turns out that every fish carries a potential lung in the swim bladder. Only by audacious application of the theory of evolution did Haeckel rescue the inductionists, who were feeling quite comfortable in these contradictions.

If induction were really so infallible, whence come the rapid successive revolutions in classification of the organic world? They are the most characteristic product of induction, and yet they annihilate one another.

### * * *

_Induction and analysis._ A striking example of how little induction can claim to be the sole or even the predominant form of scientific discovery occurs in thermodynamics: the steam-engine provided the most striking proof that one can impart heat and obtain mechanical motion. 100,000 steam-engines did not prove this more than _one,_ but only more and more forced the physicists into the necessity of explaining it. Sadi Carnot was the first seriously to set about the task. But not by induction. He studied the steam engine, analysed it, and found that in it the process which mattered does not appear in _pure form_ but is concealed by all sorts of subsidiary processes. He did away with these subsidiary circumstances that have no bearing on ‘the essential process, and an ideal steam-engine (or gas engine), which it is true is as little capable of being realised as, for instance, a geometrical line or surface but in Its way performs the same service as these mathematical abstractions: it presents the process in a pure, independent, and unadulterated form. And he came right up against the mechanical equivalent of heat (see the significance of his function C), which he only failed to discover and see because he believed in _caloric._ Here also proof of the damage done by false theories.

### * * *

The empiricism of observation alone can never adequately prove necessity. _Post hoc_ but not _propter hoc._ (_Enzyklopädie,_ I, S, 84.)[[178]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n178) This is so very correct that it does not follow from the continual rising of the sun in the morning that it will rise again tomorrow, and in fact we know now that a time will come when one morning the sun will _not rise._ But the proof of necessity lies in human activity, in experiment, in work: if I am able to _make_ the _post hoc,_ it becomes identical with the _propter hoc_.

### * * *

_Causality_. The first thing that strikes us in considering matter in motion is the inter-connection of the individual motions of separate bodies, their _being determined by_ one another. But not only do we find that a particular motion is followed by another, we find also that we can evoke a particular motion by setting up, the conditions in which it takes place in nature, that we can even produce motions which do not occur at all in nature (industry), at least not in this way, and that we can give these motions a predetermined direction and extent. _In this way_, by the activity of human beings the idea of causality becomes established, the idea that one motion is the cause of another. True, the regular sequence of certain natural phenomena can by itself give rise to the idea of causality: the heat and light that come with the sun; but this affords no proof, and to that extent Hume’s scepticism was correct in saying that a regular _post hoc_ can never establish a _propter hoc_. But the activity of human beings _forms the test_ of and make them by prove that heat comes from the sun. If we bring together in a rifle the priming, the explosive charge, and the bullet and then fire it, we count upon the effect known in advance from previous experience, because we can follow in all its details the whole process of ignition, combustion, explosion by the sudden conversion into gas and pressure of the gas on the bullet. And here the sceptic cannot even say that because of previous experience it does not follow that it will be the same next time. For, as a matter of fact, it does sometimes happen that it is not the same, that the priming or the gunpowder fails to work, that the barrel bursts, etc. But surely this which _proves_ causality instead of refuting it, because we can find out the cause of each such deviation from the rule by appropriate investigation: chemical decomposition of the priming, dampness, etc., of the gunpowder, defect in the barrel, etc., etc., so that here the test of causality is so to say a _double_ one.

Natural science, like philosophy, has hitherto entirely neglected the in influence of activity on their thought; both know only nature on the one hand and thought on the other. But it is precisely _the alteration of nature_ by men, not solely nature as such, which is most essential and immediate basis of human thought, and it is in the measure that man has learned to change nature that his intelligence has increased. The naturalistic conception of history, as found, for instance to a greater or lesser extent in Draper and other scientists, as if nature exclusively reacts on man, and natural conditions everywhere exclusively determined his historical development, is therefore one-sided and forgets that man also reacts on nature, changing it and creating new conditions of existence for himself. There is devilishly little left of “nature” as it was in Germany at the time when the Germanic peoples immigrated into it. The earth’s surface, climate, vegetation, fauna, and the human beings themselves have infinitely changed, and all this owing to human activity, while the changes of nature in Germany which have occurred in this period of time without human interference are incalculably small.

### * * *

_Reciprocal action_ is the first thing that we encounter when we consider matter in motion as A whole from the standpoint of modern natural science. We see a series of forms of motion, mechanical motion, heat, light, electricity, magnetism, chemical union and decomposition, transitions of states of aggregation, organic life, all of which, if at _present we_ still make an exception of organic life, pass into one another, mutually determine one another, are in one place cause and in another effect, the sum-total of the motion in all its changing forms remaining the same (Spinoza: substance is _causa sui_ strikingly expresses the reciprocal action).[[179]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n179) Mechanical motion becomes transformed into heat, electricity, magnetism, light, etc., and vice versa. Thus natural science confirms what Hegel has said (where?), that reciprocal action is the true _causa finalis_ of things. We cannot go back further than to knowledge of this reciprocal action, for the very reason that there is nothing behind to know. If we know the forms of motion of matter (for which it is true there is still very much lacking, in view of the short time that natural science has existed), then we know matter itself, and therewith our knowledge is complete. (Grove’s whole misunderstanding about causality rests on the fact that he does not succeed in arriving at the category of reciprocal action; he has the thing, but not the abstract thought, and hence the confusion – pp. 10-14.[[180]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n180)) Only from this universal reciprocal action do we arrive at the real causal relation. In order to understand the separate phenomena, we have to tear them out of the general inter-connection and consider them in isolation, and _then_ the changing motions appear, one as cause and the other as effect.

### * * *

For one who denies causality every natural law is a hypothesis, among others also the chemical analysis of heavenly bodies by means of the prismatic spectrum. What shallowness of thought to remain at such a viewpoint!

##### On Nägeli’s Incapacity to Know the Infinite[[181]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n181)  
Nägeli, pp. 12,13

Nägeli first of all says that we cannot know real qualitative differences, and immediately afterwards says that such “absolute differences” do not occur in nature! (p. 12.)

Firstly, every quality has infinitely many quantitative gradations, e.g., shades of colour, hardness and softness, length of life, etc., and these, although qualitatively distinct, are measurable and knowable.

Secondly, qualities do not exist but only things with qualities and indeed with infinitely many qualities. Two different things always have certain qualities (properties of corporeality at least) in common, others differing in degree, while still others may be entirely absent in one of them. If we consider two such extremely different things – e.g., a meteorite and a man – in separation, we get very little out of it, at most that heaviness and other general properties of bodies are common to both. But an infinite series of other natural objects and natural processes can be put between the two things, permitting us to complete the series from meteorite to man and to allocate to each its place in the inter-connection of nature and thus to know them. Nägeli himself admits this..

Thirdly, our various senses might give us impressions differing absolutely as regards quality. In that case, properties which we experience by means of sight, hearing, smell, taste, – and touch would be absolutely different. But even here the differences disappear with the progress of investigation. Smell and taste have long ago been recognised as allied senses belonging together, which perceive conjoint if not identical properties. Sight and hearing both perceive wave oscillations. Touch and sight supplement each other to such an extent that from. the appearance of an object we can often enough predict its tactile properties. And, finally, it is always the same “_I_” that receives and elaborates all these different sense impressions, that therefore comprehends them into a unity, and likewise these various. impressions are provided by the same thing, appearing as its common properties, and therefore helping us to know it.

To explain these different properties accessible only to different senses, to bring them into connection with one another, is precisely the task of science, which so far has not complained because we have not a general sense in place of the five special senses, or because we are not able to see or hear tastes and smells.

Wherever we look, nowhere in nature are there to be found such “qualitatively* or absolutely distinct fields,” [p.. 12) which are alleged to be incomprehensible. The whole confusion springs from the confusion about quality and quantity. In accordance with the prevailing mechanical view, Nägeli regards all qualitative differences as explained only in so far as they can be reduced to quantitative differences (on which what is necessary is said elsewhere), or because quality and quantity are for him absolutely distinct categories. Metaphysics.

“We can know _only the finite_,” etc. (p. 13.)

This is quite correct in so far as only finite objects enter the sphere of our knowledge. But the proposition needs to be supplemented by this: “fundamentally we can know _only the infinite._” In fact all real, exhaustive knowledge consists solely in raising the individual thing in thought from individuality into particularity and from this into universality, in seeking and establishing the infinite in the finite, the eternal in the transitory. The form of universality, however, is the form of self-completeness, hence of infinity; it is the comprehension of the many finites in the infinite. We know that chlorine and hydrogen, within certain limits of temperature and pressure and under the influence of light, combine with an explosion to form hydrochloric acid gas, and as soon as we know this, we know also, that this takes place _everywhere_ and _at all times_ where the above conditions are present, and it can be a matter of indifference, whether this occurs once or is repeated a million times, or on how many heavenly bodies. The form of universality in nature is _law,_ and no one talks more of _the eternal character of the laws of nature_ than the natural scientists. Hence when Nägeli says that the finite is made impossible to understand by not desiring to investigate merely this finite, but instead adding something eternal to it, then he denies either the possibility of knowing the laws of nature or their eternal character. All true knowledge of nature is knowledge of the eternal, the infinite, and hence essentially absolute.

But this absolute knowledge has an important drawback. Just as the infinity of knowable matter is composed of the purely finite things, so the infinity of the thought which knows the absolute is composed of an infinite number of finite human minds, working side by side and successively at this infinite knowledge, committing practical and theoretical blunders, setting out from erroneous, one-sided, and false premises, pursuing false, tortuous, and uncertain paths, and often not even finding what is right when they run their noses against it (Priestley[[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n182)). The cognition of the infinite is therefore beset with double difficulty and from its very nature can only take place in an infinite asymptotic progress. And that fully suffices us in order to be able to say: the infinite is just as much knowable as unknowable, and that is all that we need.

Curiously enough, Nägeli says the same thing:

“We can know only the finite, but we can know all _the finite*_ that comes. into the sphere of our sensuous perception.”

The finite that comes into the sphere, etc., constitutes in sum precisely the infinite, for _it is just from this that Nägeli has derived his idea of the infinite!_ Without this finite, etc., he would have indeed no idea of the infinite!

(Bad infinity, as such, to be dealt with elsewhere.)

---

Before this investigation of infinity comes the following:

(1) The “insignificant sphere” in regard to space and time.  
(2) The “probably defective development of the sense organs.”  
(3) That we “only know the finite, changing, transitory, only what is different in degree and relative, because we can only transfer mathematical concepts to natural objects and judge the latter only by measures obtained from them themselves. We have no notions for all that is infinite or eternal, for all that is permanent, for all absolute differences. We know exactly the meaning of an hour, a metre, a kilogram, but we do not know what time, space, force and matter, motion and rest, cause and effect are.”

It is the old story. First of all one makes sensuous things into abstractions and then one wants to know them through, the senses, to see time and smell space. The empiricist becomes so steeped in the habit of empirical experience, that he believes that he is still in the field of sensuous experience when he is operating with abstractions. We know what an hour is, or a metre, but not what time and space are! As if time was anything other than just hours, and space anything but just cubic metres! The two forms of existence of matter are naturally nothing without matter, empty concepts, abstractions which exist only in our minds. But, of course, we are supposed not to know what matter and motion are! Of course not, for matter as such and motion as such have not yet been seen or otherwise experienced by anyone, only the various existing material things and forms of motions. Matter is nothing but the totality of material things from which this concept is abstracted and motion as such nothing but the totality of all sensuously perceptible forms of motion; words like matter and motion are nothing but _abbreviations_ in which we comprehend many different sensuous perceptible things according to their common properties. Hence matter and motion _can_ be known in no other way than by investigation of the separate material things and forms of motion, and by knowing these, we also _pro tanto_ know matter and motion _as such._ Consequently, in saying that we do not know what time, space, matter, motion, cause and effect are, Nägeli merely says that first of all we make abstractions of the real world through our minds, and then can not know these self-made abstractions because they are creations of thought and not sensuous objects, while all knowing _is sensuous measurement!_ This is just like the difficulty mentioned by Hegel; we can eat cherries and plums, but not _fruit,_ because no one has so far eaten fruit as such.[[Den kapitalistiske udviklingskurve-1721248671831.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n183)

---

When Nägeli asserts that there are probably a whole number of forms of motion in nature which we cannot perceive by our senses, that is a poor apology, equivalent to the suspension – at least _for our knowledge_ of the law of the uncreatability of motion. For they could certainly be _transformed into_ motion _perceptible to_ us! That would be an easy explanation of, for instance, contact electricity.

### * * *

_Ad vocem_ Nägeli. Impossibility of conceiving the infinite. When we say that matter and motion are not created and are indestructible, we are saying, that the world exists as infinite progress, i.e., in the form of bad infinity, and thereby we have understood all of this process that is to be understood. At the most the question still arises whether this process is an eternal repetition – in great cycles – or whether the cycles have descending and ascending branches.

### * * *

_Bad infinity._ True infinity was already correctly put by Hegel in _filled_ space and time, in the process of nature and in history. The whole of nature also is now merged in history, and history is only differentiated from natural history as the evolutionary process of _self-conscious_ organisms. This infinite complexity of nature and history has within it the infinity of space and time – bad infinity – only as a sublated factor, essential but not predominant. The extreme limit of our natural science until now has been our universe, and we do not need the infinitely numerous universes outside it to have knowledge of nature. Indeed, only a _single_ sun among millions, with its solar system, forms the essential basis of our astronomical researches. For terrestrial mechanics, physics, and chemistry we are more or less restricted to our little earth, and for organic science entirely so. Yet this does not do any essential injury to the practically infinite diversity of phenomena and natural knowledge, any more than history is harmed by the similar, even greater limitation to a comparatively short period and small portion of the earth.

### * * *

1. According to Hegel, infinite progress is a barren waste because it appears only as _eternal repetition of the same thing:_ 1+1+1, etc.

2. In reality, however, it is no repetition, but a development, an advance or regression, and thereby it becomes a necessary form of motion. This apart from the fact that it is not infinite: the end of the earth’s lifetime can already be foreseen. But then, the earth is not the whole universe. In Hegel’s system, any development was excluded from the temporal history of nature, otherwise nature would not be the being-beyond-self of spirit. But in human history infinite progress is recognised by Hegel as the, sole true form of existence of “spirit,” except that fantastically this development is assumed to have an end – in the production of the Hegelian philosophy.

3. There is also infinite knowing (Quantity, p. 259. Astronomy): _questa infinita che le cose non hanno in progresso, la hanno in giro_. [This infinite, which things do not have in progress, they have In circling.[[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n185)] Thus the law of the change of form of motion is an infinite one, including itself in itself. Such infinities, however, are in their turn smitten with finiteness, and only occur piecemeal. So also 1/r2. [[186]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n186)

### * * *

The eternal laws of nature also become transformed more and more into historical ones. That water is fluid from 0°-100°C. is an eternal law of nature, but for it to be valid, there must be (1) water, (2) the given temperature, (3) normal pressure. On the moon there is no water, in the sun only its elements, and the law does not exist for these two heavenly bodies.

The laws of meteorology are also eternal, but only for the earth or for a body of the size, density, axial inclination, and temperature of the earth, and on condition that it has an atmosphere of the same mixture of oxygen and nitrogen and with the same amounts of water vapour being evaporated and precipitated. The moon has no atmosphere, the sun one of glowing metallic vapours; the former has no meteorology, that of the latter is quite different from ours.

Our whole official physics, chemistry, and biology are exclusively geocentric, calculated only for the earth. We are still quite ignorant of the conditions of electric and magnetic tensions on the sun, fixed stars, and nebulae, even on the planets of a different density from ours. On the sun, owing to high temperature, the laws of chemical combination of the elements are suspended or only momentarily operative at the limits of the solar atmosphere, the compounds becoming dissociated again on approaching the sun. The chemistry of the sun is just in process of arising, and is necessarily quite different from that of the earth, not overthrowing the latter but standing outside it. In the nebulae perhaps there do not exist even those of the 65 elements which are possibly themselves of compound nature. Hence, if we wish to speak of general laws of nature that are uniformly applicable to all bodies – from the nebula to man – we are left only with gravity and perhaps the most general form of the theory of the transformation of energy, vulgo the mechanical theory of heat. But, on its general, consistent application to all phenomena of nature, this theory itself becomes converted into a historical presentation of the successive changes occurring in a system of the universe from its origin to its passing away, hence into a history in which at each stage different laws, i.e., different phenomenal forms of the same universal motion, predominate, and so nothing remains as absolutely universally valid except – _motion_.

### * * *

The _geocentric_ standpoint in astronomy is prejudiced and has rightly been abolished. But as we go deeper in our investigations, it comes more and more into its own. The sun, etc., serve the earth (Hegel, _Naturphilosophie_, p. 155).[[187]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n187) (The whole huge sun exists merely for the sake of the little planets.) Anything other than geocentric physics, chemistry, biology, meteorology, etc., is impossible for us, and these sciences lose nothing by saying that they only hold good for the earth and are therefore only relative. If one takes that seriously and demands a centreless science, one puts a stop to all science. It suffices us to know that under the same conditions everywhere the same must take place, at a distance to the right or the left of us that is a million million times as great as the distance from the earth to the sun.

_Cognition. Ants_ have eyes different from ours, they can see chemical (?) light-rays (_Nature, June_ 8, 1882, Lubbock),[[188]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n188) but as regards knowledge of these rays that are invisible to, us, we are considerably more advanced than the ants, and the very fact that we are able to demonstrate that ants can see things invisible to us, and that this proof is based solely on perceptions made with our eyes, shows that the special construction of the human eye sets no absolute barrier to human cognition.

In addition to the eye, we have not only the other senses but also our thought activity. With regard to the latter, matters stand exactly as with the eye. To know what can be discovered by our thinking, it is no use, a hundred years after Kant, to try and find out the range of thought from the critique of reason or the investigation of the instrument of knowing. It is as little use as when Helmholtz uses the imperfection of our sight (indeed a necessary imperfection, for an eye that could see all rays would for that very reason see _nothing_ at all), and the construction of our eye – which restricts sight to definite limits and even so does not give quite correct reproduction – as proof that the eye acquaints us incorrectly or unreliably with the nature of what is seen. What can be discovered by our thought is more evident from what it has already discovered and is every day still discovering. And that is already enough both as regards quantity and quality. On the other hand, the investigation of the _forms_ of thought, the thought determinations, is very profitable and necessary, and since Aristotle this has been systematically undertaken only by Hegel.

In any case we shall never And out _how_ chemical rays appear to ants. Anyone who is distressed by this is simply beyond help.

### * * *

The form of development of natural science, in so far as it thinks, is the _hypothesis._ A new fact is observed which makes impossible the previous method of explaining the facts belonging to the same group. From this moment onwards new methods of explanation are required – at first based on only a limited number of facts and observations. Further observational material weeds out these hypotheses, doing away with some and correcting others, until finally the law is established in a pure form. If one should wait until the material for a law was _in a pure form,_ it would mean suspending the process of thought in investigation until then and, if only for this, reason, the law would never come into being.

The number and succession of hypotheses supplanting one another – given the lack of logical and dialectical education among natural scientists – easily gives rise to the idea that we cannot know the _essence_ of things (Haller and Goethe).[[189]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n189) This is not peculiar to natural science since all human knowledge develops in a much twisted curve; and in the historical sciences also, including philosophy, theories displace one another, from which, however, nobody concludes that formal logic, for instance, is nonsense.

The last form of this outlook is the “thing-in-itself” In the first place, ‘this assertion that we cannot know the thing-in-itself (Hegel, _Enzyklopadie,_ paragraph 44) passes out of the realm of science into that of fantasy. Secondly, it does not add a word to our scientific knowledge, for if we cannot occupy ourselves with things, they do not exist for us. And, thirdly, it is a mere phrase and is never applied. Taken in the abstract it sounds quite sensible. But suppose one applies it. What would one think of a zoologist who said: “A dog _seems_ to have four legs, but we do not know whether in reality it has four million legs or none at all”? Or of a mathematician who first of all defines a triangle as having three sides, and then declares that he does not know whether it might not have 25? That – 2×2 _seems_ to be 4? But scientists take care not to apply the phrase about the thing-in-itself in natural science, they permit themselves this only in passing into philosophy. This is the best proof how little seriously they take it and what little value it has itself. If they did take it seriously, what would be the good of investigating anything?

Taken historically the thing would have a certain meaning: we can only know under the conditions of our epoch and _as far as these allow._

### * * *

_The thing-in-itself:_ Hegel, _Logik_, II, p. 10, also later a whole section on it[[190]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n190):

“Scepticism did not dare to affirm ‘it is’; modern idealism (i.e., Kant and Fichte) did not dare to regard cognition as a knowledge of the thing-in-itself[In the margin of the manuscript is the remark: “Cf. _Enzyklopädie_, 1, p. 252.,”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch07c.htm#n191)] ... But at the same time, scepticism admitted manifold determinations of its show, or rather its show had for content all the manifold riches of the world. In the same manner the ‘_appearance_’ of idealism (i.e., what idealism calls appearance) comprehends the whole range of these manifold determinatenesses.... The content may then have no basis in any being nor in any thing nor thing-in-itself: _for itself it remains as it is; it has only been translated from being into show_.”

Hegel, therefore, is here a much more resolute materialist than the modern natural scientists.

### * * *

Valuable self-criticism of the Kantian _thing-in-itself,_ which shows that Kant suffers shipwreck also on the thinking ego and likewise discovers in it an unknowable thing-in-itself.

170. Hegel explains the correspondence between the division of logic into three parts (the doctrine of being, doctrine of essence, and doctrine of notion) and the four-member classification of judgments as follows: “the different species of judgment derive their features from the universal forms of the logical idea itself. If we follow this clue, it will supply us with three chief kinds of judgment parallel to the stages of Being, Essence and Notion. The second of these kinds, as required by the character of Essence, which is the stage of differentiation, must be doubled.” (Hegel, _Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences,_ § 171. Addendum.)

174. On pages 75-77 of the fourth edition of his _Natural History of Creation_ (Berlin, 1873), Haeckel relates how Goethe discovered the existence of the intermaxillary bone in man. In Haeckel’s opinion, Goethe arrived first of all at the inductive proposition: “All mammals have an intermaxillary bone,” from which he drew the deductive conclusion: “Therefore, man also has such a bone,” following which this conclusion was confirmed by experimental data (by the discovery of the intermaxillary bone in the human embryo and in occasional atavistic cases in adults). Engels says that the induction of which Haeckel speaks is incorrect because it was contradicted by the proposition, considered correct, that the mammal “man” has no intermaxillary bone.

175. Engels is obviously referring to the two main works of Whewell: _History of the Inductive Sciences_ (three volumes, London, 1837) and _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_ (two volumes, London, 1840).

The manuscript has: “_die bloss mathematisch_(_en_) _umfass_[_en_]_d._” The word “umfassend” is used here obviously in the sense of “comprising” the purely mathematical sciences, which, according to Whewell, are sciences of pure reason that investigate the “conditions of all theory” and in this sense occupy, as it were, a central position in the “geography of the intellectual world.” In _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_ (Vol. I, Book II), Whewell gives a brief outline of the “philosophy of the pure sciences,” regarding geometry, theoretical arithmetic and algebra as its main components. In his _History of the Inductive Sciences_ Whewell counterposes the “inductive sciences” (mechanics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, physiology, geology) to the “deductive” sciences (geometry, arithmetic, algebra).

176. In the formula U-I-P, U denotes the Universal, I – the Individual, P – the Particular. This formula is used by Hegel in analysing the logical essence of inductive conclusions.

This_ note is devoted to a critical analysis of the basic theses put for ward by the botanist Nägeli in his lecture to the Munich Congress of German Natural Scientists and Physicians on September 20, 1877. Nägeli’s lecture was entitled “Die Schranken der naturwissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis” (“The Limits of Natural-Scientific Knowledge”). Engels quotes it according to the Appendix to the congress report (_Tageblatt der 50. Versammlung deutscher Naturforscher und Aerzte in Munchen_ 1877. Beilage, September 1877). This edition was supplied to Engels in all probability by K. Schorlemmer, who attended the Congress.

182. Engels is referring to the discovery of oxygen in 1774 by Joseph Priestley, who did not even guess that he had discovered a new chemical element and that this discovery would lead to a revolution in chemistry. Engels speaks in more detail about this discovery in his preface to the second volume of Marx’s _Capital_.

183. Cf. Hegel, _Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences,_ § 13, Note: “When the universal is made a mere form and co-ordinated with the particular, it sinks into a particular itself. Even common sense in every-day matters is above the absurdity of setting a universal _beside the_ particulars. Would any one, who wished for fruit, reject cherries, pears, and grapes, on the ground that they were cherries, pears, or grapes, and not fruit?”

184. This reference is to Hegel’s _Science of Logic,_ in the section on Quantity. Hegel mentions astronomy and says it is admirable not because of the bad infinity of immeasurable distances, time and the immeasurable multitude of stars, but “rather because of those ‘relations of measure and those laws which reason recognises in these objects; for they are the infinity of reason and those others the infinity of unreason.” Hegel, _Science of Logic_, Vol. 1, Part II, Chapter 2, Note: “High Opinion of Infinite Progress.”

185. This is a quotation, slightly modified by Engels, from the treatise Della moneta (_On Money_) of the Italian economist Galiani. This same quotation was used by Marx in Volume I of _Capital_. Marx and Engels used the Custodi edition _Scrittori classici italiani di economia politica. Parte moderna_, Tomo III, Milano. 1803, p. 156.

186. The words “so also 1/r2” were added subsequently by Engels. It is possible that Engels has in mind the number p, which has a quite definite meaning, but which cannot be expressed by a finite decimal or an ordinary fraction. If the area of a circle is taken as 1, the formula p_r_2 = 1 gives: p, =1/r2 (where _r_ is the radius of the circle).

187. Engels is referring to the following passage in Hegel’s _Philosophy of Nature: “_The sun serves the planet, just as in general sun, moon, comets, stars are merely significations of the earth!’ (§280, Addendum).

188. Engels is referring to George Romanes’s review of Sir John Lubbock’s book _Ants, Bees, and Wasps,_ London, 1882. The review appeared in the British journal _Nature_ No. 658, of June 8, 1882.

The passage which interested Engels, that ants are “very sensitive to the ultra-violet rays,” occurs on page 122 of Vol. XXVI of _Nature._

189. Engels is referring to A. von Haller’s poem “Falschheit der menschlichen Tugenden,” in which Haller asserted: “No mortal mind can Nature’s inner secrets tell, too happy only if he knows the outer shell.” Goethe, in his poem “Allerdings” (1820) opposed Haller’s assertion, pointing out that Nature is a single unity and cannot be divided, as is done by Haller, into an unknowable inner kernel and an outer shell accessible to man. Hegel mentions this argument between Goethe and Haller twice in his _Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences_ (§ 140, Note, and § 246, Addendum).

190. Hegel, _Science of Logic,_ Book II, Section I, Chapter 1, Paragraph “Show,” and Section II (“Appearance”) which contains a special paragraph on thing-in-itself (“Thing-in-Itself and Existence”) and an observation (“The Thing-in-Itself of Transcendental Idealism”).

#### On the “Dialectics” of the “Theoreticians” of the Communist League

[In this battle with revisionism, with the proponents of fundamental distortions of Marxism, and to thereby repudiate the illusory notions of Marxian dialectics that the “theoreticians” inspire in the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie, and worse yet, in the proletariat, it will be necessary to quote at length Marx’s great work, _The Poverty of Philosophy_, chapter II, “The Metaphysics of Political Economy”.]

“As dialecticians” say the writers of the _Peoples Tribune_, “we fully understand that the process of growth (our emphasis) is the process of ebb and flow or more specifically a process of leaps that are followed by crises – backsliding and then another leap. This process involves the whole of the motion of quantity to quality. We see it only natural that this scientific process be applied to the history of humanity as well as the history of every other organism.” – _Peoples Tribune_, vol 4, no 10, p 3.

In the “Dialectics of the Development of the Communist League”, J.V. Stalin is quoted as saying that Marxist dialectics “Does not regard the process of development as a simple _process of growth_ ...” (our emphasis)

Having studied the League’s formulation of dialectics in _Peoples Tribune_, vol 4, no 10, and having contrasted it with the formulation of Stalin which they themselves quote, we find there to be something bizarre, to say the least, in the League’s rather lyrical formulation. For that reason, we set about seriously studying and contrasting the League’s use of dialectics with that of our great Marxist-Leninist teachers and leaders.

Let us begin with the League’s attempt to grasp “the essentials of the dialectical method of Marx and Engels”. Where does the League look in Marx for their definition of dialectics? With the following ”famous quote on dialectics” from the Poverty of Philosophy they begin their discussion on Dialectics:

Wherein does the movement of pure reason consist? In posing itself, opposing itself, composing itself: in formulating itself as thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or yet again in affirming itself, negating itself and negating its negation.

At this point given the phrase “pure reason” we found the League’s language and choice of quotes to be not only bizarre, but also rather revealing, given that Marx’s dialectics are inseparable from philosophical materialism as opposed to philosophical idealism.

In an effort to discover what in particular it was about the League’s language and choice of quotes that gave rise to these doubts, we turned to that great work by Karl Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy, from which the League has expropriated its definition of ”Marxist” dialectics. We find that in fact Marx was not discussing his own dialectics, but those of the arch-idealist and metaphysician Hegel. Let us then quote at length the passage from which the League has stolen its fundamental characterization of “Marxist” dialectics:

. . . The economists’ material is the active, energetic life of man; M. Proudhon’s material is the dogmas of the economists. But the moment we cease to pursue the historical movement of production relations, of which the categories are but the theoretical expression, the moment we want to see in these categories no more than ideas, spontaneous thoughts, independent of real relations, we are forced to attribute the origin of these thoughts to the movement of pure reason. How does pure external, impersonal reason give rise to these thoughts? How does it proceed in order to produce them?

If we had M. Proudhon’s intrepidity on the matter of Hegelianism we should say: it is distinguished in itself from itself. What does this mean? Impersonal reason, having outside itself neither a base on which it can pose itself, nor an object to which it can oppose itself, nor a subject with which it can compose itself, is forced to turn head over heals in posing itself, opposing itself and composing itself. . .

Here we will stop for a moment in order to point out that this is the precise conception of dialectics and language which the Communist League holds from “Dialectics of the Development . . . ”, we quote again their own words:

We should search carefully and find out how and why the Marxist revolutionary movement posed itself, opposed itself and elevated itself as a composition to a higher level.

This is nothing other than the Hegelianism of Proudhon which was resoundingly defeated and ridiculed by Marx as “twaddle”, being put forward once again over 100 years later! With this most intriguing insight in mind, let us go on with Marx:

. . . position, opposition, composition. Or to speak Greek, we have thesis, antithesis and synthesis.

Again let us stop and quote the “League” from its own paper:

Imperialism created its antithesis – the colonies,

and

Thesis: capitalist imperialism, antithesis: the proletariat and the toiling masses, synthesis: socialism, – _Peoples Tribune_, vol 4, no 8, p 7.

The audacity of printing such drivel and calling it Marxism-Leninism is matched only by the insidiousness of the motives that must have engendered it. To go on with Marx:

... For those who do not know the Hegelian language we shall give the consecrating formula: affirmation, negation, and negation of the negation.

Once again, let us pause in order to study the brilliance of the Communist League’s dialecticians:

Without getting lost in historical analysis (?), we can say that Imperialism arose as the negation of its opposite, free enterprise (?!). It arose as the antithesis or the opposition but above all as the negation of the previous economic state of affairs. But imperialism is not simply an economic motion – it is also a social motion; in the process of that motion it is bound to be negated as it negated its negative. – from “Dialectics.. .of the Communist League”

Let us go on with the refutation of M. Proudhon by Marx:

That is what language means. It is certainly not Hebrew (with due apologies to M. Proudhon); but IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF THIS PURE REASON, SEPARATE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL. INSTEAD OF THE ORDINARY INDIVIDUAL WITH HIS ORDINARY MANNER OF SPEAKING AND THINKING WE HAVE NOTHING BUT THIS ORDINARY IN ITSELF – WITHOUT THE INDIVIDUAL MANNER (emphasis ours).” And

All that exists, all that lives on land and under water, exists and lives only by some kind of movement. Thus the movement of history produces social relations; industrial movement gives us industrial products, etc.

Just as by dint of abstractions we have transformed everything into a logical category, so one has only to make an abstraction of every characteristic distinctive of different movements to attain movement in its abstract condition – purely formal movement, the purely logical formula of movement. If one finds in logical categories the substance of all things, one imagines ABSOLUTE METHOD, which not only explains all things but also implies the movement of things.

It is this absolute method that Hegel sneaks in these terms: ’Method is the absolute, unique, supreme, infinite force, which no object can resist; it is the tendency of reason to find itself again, to recognize itself in every object.’

So what is this absolute method? The abstraction of movement. What is the abstraction of movement? Movement in abstract condition. What is movement in abstract condition? THE PURELY LOGICAL FORMULA OF MOVEMENT OR THE MOVEMENT OF PURE REASON. WHEREIN DOES THE MOVEMENT OF PURE REASON CONSIT? IN POSING ITSELF, OPPOSING ITSELF, COMPOSING ITSELF: IN FORMULATING ITSELF AS THESIS, ANTITHESIS, SYNTHESIS; OR YET AGAIN, IN AFFIRMING ITSELF, NEGATING ITSELF AND NEGATING ITS NRGATION.

HOW DOES REASON MANAGE TO AFFIRM ITSELF, TO POSE ITSELF IN A DEFINITE CATEGORY? THAT IS THE BUSINESS OF REASON ITSELF AND OF ITS APOLOGISTS (Among whom we may now number the so-called theoreticians of the Communist League).

And so we see how from the very beginning of their discussion of dialectics the League’s theoreticians have failed to establish a correct understanding and expression of Marxists dialectics. Instead they are immersed in the Hegelianism of their great forebear, M. Proudhon.

On these idealist legs the League’s theoreticians wander through the forest of history and as in the old addage “fail to see the forest for the trees or the trees for the forest.” In the League’s own words:

We should search carefully and find out how and why the Marxist revolutionary movement posed itself, opposed itself, and elevated itself as a composition to a higher level. Only in this manner can we understand the qualitative level and historical tasks of our Communist League.

Without getting lost in historical analysis. . .

From the very beginning they will not get lost in history because there is no history here. The closest thing to history in the rest of this article are a few quotes from Stalin, a long list of names and events all mechanically inter-related, and the interesting bit of gossip that “(Ruthenberg) died of a appendicitis, that despite warnings, he would not attend to.” This ever narrowing description of the history of the labor movement and associated social movements in the world and the U.S.A. is nothing more than an ever narrower intellectual biography of a small handful of individuals who came to call themselves the Communist League. As with all idealist historical writings, it is not the material objective conditions which determine the development of social consciousness, it is the inter-play of ideas in the heads of a handful of theoreticians. It is the “Idea” being worked out in history that is being described in this history of the development of the Communist League. The role of the depression, of World War II, of the Korean War, of unemployment and inflation are absent in this description. Holding true to their original conception of the Communist movement,

. . . the Communist movement could not and did not arise out of the struggles of the proletariat, but rather arose out of the morality of the middle classes, and their struggle against the insatiable monopolies.

Thus, the first communists are hardly ever workers, but are highly theoretical intellectuals. The inevitable composition of this position and opposition is a synthesis that is the unity of the theory and practice of the class struggle and the proletarian revolution. The embodiment of this synthesis is the modern Marxist-Leninist Communist Party. – from “Dialectics of C.L.”

Not satisfied, the CL theoreticians go on to characterize the working class movement as the movement of concepts:

So, out of the revisionist concepts of mass democracy and legal activity grew its opposite which was united with it; the concept of illegal activity in opposition to the masses. This development of the mid 1880’s was concrete proof of Marx’s dialectical method Marx wrote:

’But once it has managed to pose itself as a thesis this thesis, this thought opposed to itself splits up into two contradictory thoughts – the positive and the negative, the yes and no. The struggle between these two antagonistic elements comprised in the antithesis constitutes the dialectical movement. The yes becoming no, the no becoming yes, the yes becoming both yes and no, the no becoming both no and yes, the contraries balance, neutralize, paralyze each other. The fusion of these two contradictory thoughts constitutes a new thought, which is the synthesis of them.’

Marx was not discussing his dialectics here. He was portraying the idealist dialectics, the “abstract method” of “pure reason”. He was describing how the speculations of idealists lead to the systematization of categories into schemas. His reason for doing this was to show that the idealist schemas had no basis in historical reality, i.e., the material conditions of history. We quote Karl Marx

Apply this method to the categories of political economy, and you have the logic and metaphysics of political economy or, in other words, you have the economic categories that everybody knows, translated into a little-known language which makes them look as if they had newly blossomed forth in an intellect of pure reason; so much do these categories seem to engender one another, to be linked up and intertwined with one another by the very working of the dialectic movement. The reader must not get alarmed at these metaphysics with all their scaffolding of categories, groups, series and systems. M. Proudhon, in spite of all the trouble he has taken to scale the heights of the system of contradictions, has never been able to raise himself above the first two rungs of simple thesis and antithesis; and even these he has mounted only twice and on one of these two occasions he fell over backwards. “Up to now we have expounded only the dialectics of Hegel. We shall see later how M. Proudhon has succeeded in reducing it to the meanest proportions. Thus, for Hegel, all that has happened and is still happening is only just what is happening in his own mind. Thus the philosophy of history is nothing hut the history of philosophy, of his own philosophy. There is no longer a ’history according to the order in time,’ there is only ’the sequence of ideas in the understanding’. He thinks he is constructing the world by the movement of thought, whereas he is merely reconstructing systematically and classifying by the absolute method the thoughts which are in the minds of all.

As for the CL’s assertion that the history of the revolutionaries in the U.S.A. stems from the conflict of the Socialist Labor Party with the International Working People’s Association, and not from the developing material conditions, let us quote Karl Marx in order to show how such a conception of history as being the incarnation of slumbering ideas, principles or notions, is none other than M. Proudhon’s idealism:

Economic categories are only the theoretical expressions, the abstractions of the social relations of productions. Proudhon, holding things upside down like a true philosopher, sees in actual relations nothing but the incarnation of these principles, of these categories, which were slumbering – so M. Proudhon the philosopher tells us – in the bosom of the ’impersonal reason of humanity.’

The method of the CL “dialecticians” is to take any two groups or things and call one the thesis, the other the antithesis. Pose their unification as a synthesis. If they are not united battle to unite them. If the CL’s or their predecessors’ so-called Marxism-Leninism is not united with the working class, they battle to unite the two. But, where does this battle take place? Where is the material base for this subjugation of reality to ideas? We quote from “Dialectics of the Development of the Communist League”:

On the battlefield of the masses and in the struggle for liberal democracy, the Communists were outstanding.

It is ultimately the masses who are the cannon fodder in this great war between ideas. As with M. Proudhon, the CL scales the ladder of contradictions but falls over backwards once having arrived at the second rung by posing themselves as the antithesis to revisionism.

The only meaningful conclusion we can draw from all this claptrap is the following: Sincere but undeveloped cadres, fierce fighters in the struggle to dump the “trotskyist and nationalist orientation that had been imposed on them”, in merging with ”a large grouping of mainly ex-SDS militants who were studying the thought of Mao Tsetung”, made a fatal error of using basically petty-bourgeois and bourgeois anarchists and agents in order to establish their “organizational base”. The world renowned fools who made up the membership of SDS were never taken seriously by any hardworking cadres anywhere. In testimony before government panels and in interviews to public broadcasting interviewers in New York, agent after agent revealed they had infiltrated SDS and had used the organization in order to portray Marxist groups as malcontents and anarchists, in some cases actually instigating and carrying out bombings at the behest of their superiors.

What then have we discovered? That in fact our suspicions were justified. The stench emanating from the writings of the Communist League was not the result of a few rotten word choices and an inappropriate quote. It was in fact a stench emanating from the very minds of the authors of such unadulterated counter-revolutionary filth, minds that in their very deviousness and dishonesty are rotting the very organization they are supposedly guiding!!

BEWARE all serious and sincere revolutionaries. Such an abuse of Marxism-Leninism, such a fundamentally insidious attempt to divert our primitive and undeveloped comrades from the scientific and correct positions of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought can have but one purpose:

THE RUTHLESS SUPPRESSION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT AND THE LIQUIDATION OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST FASCISM AND SOCIAL-FASCISM!!

Their fundamental misunderstanding of dialectics permeates every aspect of their work, from the debate over “third forces” to the debate over how to build a party and how to handle contradictions within the revolutionary left. Let us go on to the _Peoples Tribune_ explanation and treatment of the “third forces” question, but after a brief list of but a few of the oddities arising from their fundamentally non-Marxist understanding of dialectics.

#### CL. THEORETICIANS LAUNCH THEIR ATTACK ON DIALECTICS:

From the stand point of dialectical materialism, can there be a third force in any entity? Marxism denies this possibility.

Imperialism created its antithesis – the colonies.

There is no possible third force from the standpoint of theory and philosophy. Thesis: Capitalist imperialism, antithesis: the proletariat and the toiling masses, synthesis: socialism. This is the motion of history.

At the point where investment in the national market and the national productive process became unprofitable this accumulation of capital was invested overseas.

The truth of the matter is that the capitalists understand the dialectical process just as we do. (and here the _Peoples Tribune_ hangs itself!) They understand that if they don’t supply the alternative to imperialism, we will. They want and have a situation where they both pose and oppose.

Under the pressure of current events, the so-called Left is undergoing the dialectical process of splitting and turning upon itself.

First of all it means that the struggle for unity of the revolution, is moving to a higher stage – because unity is unthinkable without disunity.

Growth is the process of excreting the negative as well as assimilating the positive.

Take out the working class and you have nothing – take out the leading role of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Parties and groupings and you have nothing. [This statement could not be attributed to even the most naive Marxist, the most misled theoretician of Marxism, nor even anyone with any sense at all who is taking an honest look at history. Before Marx was born there was class struggle, before the ideas of Marx were carried to the world there was class struggle, and no matter how long and how effectively bourgeois schemers prevent the organization of a Marxist-Leninist Communist Party there will be class struggle. Communist League dialectics is a vacilation between empiricism and idealism, which ever suits their purpose better as wreckers and liquidators.]

. . .Marxism is a theoretical movement.

A revolution is an epochal motion.

We refer to it as a semi-colony because it appears to stand half way between direct colonialism and freedom. However, it is in motion -- either the revolution in permanence being crowned with the dictatorship of the proletariat, or backsliding into neo-colonialism.

These quotes can be found in the CL “Reply” articles, beginning with vol. 4, no. 8 to vol. 5, no. 2, and perhaps with its further volumes, the list will grow. That is to be seen. [note, the _Peoples Tribune_ has not changed at all but continues with its emanation of philosophical idealism.]

Part Two – Problems of the Marxist-Leninist Theory of Dialectics

### 9: On the Coincidence of Logic with Dialectics and the Theory of Knowledge of Materialism

---

  

Like any other science logic is concerned with explaining and systematising objective forms and patterns not dependent on men’s will and consciousness, within which human activity, both material-objective and mental-theoretical, takes place. Its subject matter is _**the objective laws of subjective activity.**_

Such a conception is quite unacceptable to traditional logic since, from the standpoint of the latter, it unites the unjoinable, i.e. an affirmation and its negation, A and not-A, opposing predicates. For the subjective is not objective, and vice versa. But the state of affairs in the real world and in the science comprehending it also proves unacceptable to traditional logic, because in it the transition, formation, and transformation of things and processes (including into their own opposite) prove to be _**the essence of the matter**_ at every step. Traditional logic is consequently inadequate to the real practice of scientific and therefore has to be brought into correspondence with the latter.

Marx and Engels showed that science and practice, quite independently of consciously acquired logical notions, developed in accordance with the universal laws that had been described by the dialectical tradition in philosophy. It can (and in fact does) happen, even in situations when each separate representative of science involved in its general progress is consciously guided by undialectical ideas about thought. Science as a whole, through the clash of undialectical opinions mutually provoking and correcting one another, develops for all that in accordance with a logic of a higher type and order.

The theoretician who has succeeded finally in finding the concrete solution to some contentious problem or other has been objectively forced to think dialectically. Genuine logical necessity drives a road for itself in this case despite the theoretician’s consciousness, instead of being realised purposively and freely. It therefore transpires that the greatest theoreticians and natural scientists, whose work has determined the main lines of development of science, have been guided as a rule by the dialectical traditions in logic. Thus Albert Einstein owed much to Spinoza, and Heisenberg to Plato, and so on.

Taking this conception as their starting point, Marx, Engels, and Lenin established that it was dialectics, and only dialectics, that was the real logic in accordance with which modern thought made progress. It was it, too, that operated at the ‘growing points’ of modern science, although the representatives of science were not wholly conscious of the fact. That was why logic as a science coincided (merged) not only with dialectics but also with _**the theory of knowledge**_ of materialism. ‘In _Capital_ Marx applied to a single science logic, dialectics, and the theory of knowledge of materialism (three words are not needed; it is one and the same thing),’ is how Lenin categorically formulated it.

The problem of the relation of logic, the theory of knowledge, and dialectics occupied a special place in Lenin’s work. One can say, without danger of exaggeration, that it forms the core of all his special philosophical reflections, to which he returned again and again, each time formulating his conception and solution more succinctly and categorically.

In Lenin’s reflections, especially those arising in the course of critical rethinking of Hegelian structures, two themes are clearly distinguished: (1) the inter-relation between logic and epistemology; and

(2) the conception of dialectics as a science that includes its own scientific, theoretical solution of problems that are traditionally isolated from it in the form of logic and the theory of knowledge. Reconstruction of the considerations that enabled Lenin to formulate the position of modern materialism (i.e. Marxism) so categorically is very important for the simple reason that no unanimous interpretation of his propositions has yet been reached in Soviet philosophy.

Although the direct object of the critical analysis documented in the _Philosophical Notebooks_ was first and foremost Hegel’s conception, it would of course be a mistake to see in that book only a critical commentary on Hegel’s works. Lenin was concerned, it goes without saying, not with Hegel as such but with the real content of problems that still preserve their urgent significance to this day. In other words Lenin undertook, in the form of a critical analysis of the Hegelian conception, a survey of the state of affairs in philosophy in his own day, comparing and evaluating the means of posing and resolving its cardinal problems. Quite naturally, the problem of scientific knowledge came to the fore, around which – and more clearly as time went on – all world philosophical thought revolved at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Here is how Lenin depicted the aim of his investigations: "The theme of logic. To be compared with present-day "epistemology".’

The inverted commas enclosing the word ‘epistemology’ are not there quite by chance. The fact is that the isolation of a number of old philosophical problems in a special philosophical science (it is all the same whether we recognise it then as the sole form of scientific philosophy or as only of the many divisions of philosophy) is a fact of recent origin. The term itself came into currency only in the latter half of the nineteenth century as the designation of a special science, of a special field of investigation that had not been sharply distinguished in any way in the classical philosophical systems, and had not constituted either a special science or even a special division, although it would be an error, of course, to affirm that knowledge in general and scientific knowledge in particular had only become the subject of specially close attention with the development of ‘epistemology’.

The setting up of epistemology as a special science was associated historically and essentially with the broad spread of Neokantianism, which became, during the last third of the nineteenth century, the most influential trend in the bourgeois philosophical thought of Europe, and was converted into the officially recognised school of professorial, university philosophy, first in Germany, and then in all those areas of the world from which people came to the German universities hoping to study serious professional philosophy there. Neokantianism owed its spread not least to the traditional fame of Germany as the home of Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel.

Its special feature was not at all, of course, the discovery of knowledge as the central philosophical problem, but the specific form in which it was posed, which boiled down (despite all the disagreements among the various branches of this school) to the following: ‘It is accepted to call the doctrine of knowledge, inquiring into the conditions by which indisputably existing knowledge becomes possible, and limits are established in accordance with these conditions up to which any knowledge whatsoever can be extended but beyond which there opens up the sphere of equally undemonstrable opinions, the "theory of knowledge" or "epistemology". ... The theory of knowledge, of course, together with the tasks mentioned above, rightly poses itself yet other, and supplementary, tasks. But if it wants to be a science making sense it must, above all, concern itself with explaining the problem of the existence or non-existence of boundaries to knowledge ...’

The Russian Kantian A. I. Vvedensky, author of the definition just quoted, very accurately and clearly indicated the special feature of the science that ‘it is accepted to call’ epistemology in the literature of the Neokantian trend, and in all the schools that have arisen under its predominant influence. Dozens of similar formulations could be cited from the classical authors of Neokantianism (Rickert, Wundt, Cassirer, Windelband) and the work of such representatives of ‘daughter’ branches as Schuppe and Vaihinger.

The job of the theory of knowledge, consequently, was considered to be the establishment of ‘limits of knowledge’, boundaries that knowledge could not cross in any circumstances, or however high the development of the cognitive capacities of a person or of humanity, or of the technique of scientific experiment and research. These ‘limits’ differentiated the sphere of what was knowable, in principle from that of what was in principle unknowable, extralimital, ‘transcendent’. They were not determined at all by the limitation of human experience in space and time (in that case extension of the ‘sphere of experience’ would constantly widen them, and the problem would boil down simply to differentiation between what was already known and what was not yet known but was, in principle, knowable), but by the eternal and immutable nature of man’s psycho-physiological peculiarities through which all external influences were refracted (as through a prism). These ‘specific mechanisms’, by which alone the external world was given to man, were those that generated the ‘limit’ beyond which lay what was in principle unknowable. What was unknowable in principle proved to be nothing more nor less than the real world lying outside man’s consciousness, as it was ‘before its appearance in consciousness’. In other words ‘epistemology’ was distinguished as a special science in this tradition only on the grounds of _a priori_ acceptance of the thesis that, human knowledge was not knowledge of the external world (i.e. existing outside consciousness) but was only a process of the ordering, organisation, and systematisation of facts of ‘inner experience’, i.e. ultimately of the psycho-physiological states of the human organism, absolutely dissimilar to the states and events of the external world.

That meant that any science, be it physics or political economy, mathematics or history, did not tell us anything (and could not) about just how matters stood in the external world, because in fact it described only facts arising within ourselves, the psycho-physiological phenomena illusorily perceived as a sum of external facts.

For the sake of special proof of this thesis a special science ‘epistemology’ was created that concerned itself exclusively with the ‘inner conditions’ of knowledge and purged them carefully of any dependence whatsoever on the effect of ‘external conditions’, above all of a ‘condition’ such as the existence of an external world with its own objective laws.

‘Epistemology’ was thus distinguished as a special science counterposed to ‘ontology’ (or ‘metaphysics’), and not at all as a discipline investigating the real course of human knowledge of the surrounding world; quite the contrary, it was born as a doctrine postulating that every form of knowledge without exception was not a form of knowledge of the surrounding world but only a specific schema of the organisation of the ‘subject of knowledge’.

From the standpoint of this ‘theory of knowledge’ any attempt to interpret existing knowledge as knowledge (understanding) of the surrounding world was impermissible ‘metaphysics’, ‘ontologisation’ of purely subjective forms of activity, an illusory attributing of determinations of the subject to ‘things in themselves’, to the world outside consciousness.

By ‘metaphysics’ and’ ontology’ then was meant not so much a special science of ‘the world as a whole’, a universal scheme of the world, as the whole aggregate of real, so-called ‘positive’ sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, political economy, history, and so on). So that the main fervour of Neokantian ‘epistemologism’ proved to be directed precisely against the idea of a scientific world outlook, of a scientific understanding of the world realised in the real sciences themselves. A ‘scientific world outlook’, according to this view, was an absurdity, nonsense, since ‘science’ (read: the whole aggregate of natural and social sciences) in general knew nothing about the world outside consciousness and did not speak of it. Under the scornful term ‘metaphysics’ Neokantians therefore in fact refuse the laws and patterns discovered and formulated by physics, chemistry, biology, political economy, history, etc., any philosophical significance as a world outlook. From their point of view metaphysics could not be a ‘science’, and science (read again: the aggregate of all sciences) could not and had no right to play the role of ‘metaphysics’, i.e. to lay claim to an objective meaning (in the materialist sense of the term) for its statements. A world outlook therefore also could not be scientific, because it was the connected aggregate of views of the world within which man lived, acted, and thought, and science was not in a position to unite its achievements in a world outlook without thereby falling into difficulties that were unresolvable for it, into contradictions.

This had already, allegedly, been demonstrated once and for all by Kant. It was impossible to build a world outlook from the data of science. But why not, precisely?

Because the very principles of knowledge, which were the conditions for the possibility of any scientific synthesis of notions into concepts, judgments, and inferences, i.e. into categories, at the same time also proved to be the conditions of the impossibility of achieving a full synthesis of all scientific ideas into the body of a connected, united, and non-contradictory picture of the world. And that, in the language of Kantians, meant that a world outlook built on scientific principles (or simply a scientific world outlook) was impossible in principle. In a scientific world outlook (and not by chance, not from lack of information, but of the necessity inherent in the very nature of thought expressed in categorial schemas) there were always flaws of contradictions cracking it to bits that were unconnectable with one another without flagrant breach of the supreme principle of all analytical judgments, the principle of contradiction in scientific determinations.

Man could unite and connect the isolated fragments of the scientific picture of the world into a higher unity in one way only, by breaking his own supreme principles; or, what was the same thing, by turning unscientific schemas of the coupling of ideas in a united whole into the principles of synthesis, since the latter had no relation with the principle of contradiction, but were the principles of faith and opinion, dogmas that were equally undemonstrable and uncontrovertible scientifically, and were acceptable solely according to irrational whims, sympathy, conscience, etc., etc. Only faith was capable of synthesising the fragments of knowledge into a united picture at those points where all attempts to do so by means of science were doomed to failure. Hence the slogan specific to all Kantians of the uniting of science and faith, of the logical principles of the construction of a scientific picture of the world and of irrational precepts (logically undemonstrable and incontrovertible), compensating the powerlessness organically built into the intellect to accomplish the highest synthesis of knowledge.

Only within the limits described above could the meaning of the Kantian posing of the problem of the relation of logic to the theory of knowledge be understood. Logic as such was interpreted by all Kantians as _**part of the theory of knowledge.**_ Occasionally this ‘part’ was given the main significance and it almost swallowed the whole (for example, in the variants of Cohen and Natorp, Cassirer and Rickert, Vvedensky and Chelpanov), and occasionally it was relegated to a more modest place, subordinated to the other ‘parts’ of the theory of knowledge; but logic was always ‘part’. The theory of knowledge was broader, because its job was wider, since reason (understanding) was not the sole, though the most important, means of processing the data of sensations, perceptions, and ideas into the form of knowledge, into concepts and a system of concepts, into science. Logic, therefore, in the Kantian interpretation, never covered the whole field of the problems of the theory of knowledge; beyond it lay an analysis of processes effected by other aptitudes, that is to say, perception, and intuition, and memory, and imagination, and many others. Logic, as the theory of discursive thought, which moved in rigorous determinations and in strict accord with rules clearly realisable and formulatable, only partly did the job of the theory of knowledge, only through analysis of its own object, singled out from the whole complex of cognitive faculties. The main job of the theory of knowledge, however, thus also remained logic’s chief task, i.e. to establish the limits of knowledge and clarify the inner limitedness of the possibilities of thought in the course of constructing a world outlook.

Logic therefore had neither the least connection nor least relation with understanding of the real world of ‘things in themselves’. It was applicable solely to things already realised (with or without its involvement), i.e. to the psychic phenomena of human culture. Its special task was rigorous analysis of the already available images of consciousness (transcendental objects), i.e. their resolution into simple components, expressed in strictly defined terms, and the reverse operation, the synthesis or linking together of the components into complex systems of determinations (concepts, systems of concepts, theories) again by the same rigorously established rules.

Logic must also demonstrate that real discursive thought was incapable of leading knowledge beyond the limits of existing consciousness, or of crossing the boundaries dividing the ‘phenomenal’ world from the world of ‘things in themselves’. Thought, if it were logical, could not concern itself with ‘things in themselves’, and had no right to. So that, even within the boundaries of knowledge, thought was assigned in turn a limited field of legitimate application, within which the rules of logic were binding and obligatory.

The laws and rules of logic were inapplicable to the images of perception as such, to sensations, to ideas, to the phantoms of mythologised consciousness, including in that the idea of God, of the immortality of the soul, and so on. But they did, and had to, serve as filters, as it were, retaining these images at the boundaries of scientific knowledge. And only that. To judge whether these images were true in themselves, whether they played a positive or a negative role in the body of spiritual culture, thought oriented on logic had neither the possibilities nor the right. In fact there was not and could not be a rationally substantiated, scientifically verified position in relation to any image of consciousness if it arose before and independently of the special logical activity of the mind, before and outside science. In science, inside its specific limits defined by logic, the existence of such images was inadmissible. Beyond its limits their existence was sovereign, outside the jurisdiction of reason and comprehension and therefore morally and epistemologically inviolable.

Considering the special features of the Kantian interpretation of the relation of logic and epistemology, one can understand the close attention that Lenin paid to Hegel’s solution of this problem. In Hegel’s understanding of the matter logic as a whole and in full, without irrational vestiges, embraced the whole field of the problems of knowledge and left no images of contemplation or fantasy outside its boundaries. It included their examination as external products (realised in the sensuously perceived material) of the real force of thought, because they were thought itself, only embodied not in words, judgments, and conclusions, deductions and inferences, but in _**things**_ (actions, events, etc.) sensibly opposed to the individual consciousness. Logic merged here with the theory of knowledge because all other cognitive faculties were considered as _**forms of thought,**_ as thinking that had not yet attained an adequate form of expression, had not yet matured to it.

Here we come up against the extreme expression, as it were, of Hegel’s absolute idealism, according to which the whole world, and not only the cognitive faculties, was interpreted as alienated or estranged (embodied) thought that has not yet arrived at itself. With that, of course, Lenin as a consistent materialist could not agree. It is very indicative, however, that Lenin formulated his attitude to the Hegelian solution very cautiously: ‘In this conception (i.e. Hegel’s – _EVI_), logic coincides with the _**theory of knowledge.**_ This is in general a very important question.’

We have succeeded, it seems, in demonstrating just why, in the course of Lenin’s reading of Hegel’s logic, this problem appeared more and more clearly to him to be ‘very important’, and perhaps the most important of all; why Lenin’s thought returned to it again and again, in circles as it were, each time becoming more and more definite and categorical. The fact is that the Kantian conception of logic, generally accepted at the time, as part of the theory of knowledge, by no means remained an abstract, philosophical, theoretical construction. The Kantian theory of knowledge defined the limits of the competence of science in general, leaving the most acute problems as regards world outlook beyond its limits, and declaring them ‘transcendental’ for logical thought, i.e. for theoretical knowledge and solution. But in this case the union of scientific investigation and faith in the corpus of a world outlook would be not only permissible but necessary. And it was in fact under the banner of Kantianism that the revisionist stream (the principles of which had been laid down by Eduard Bernstein and Conrad Schmidt) surged forward in the socialist movement. The Kantian theory of knowledge was directly oriented here on ‘uniting’ ‘rigorous scientific thought’ (the thinking of Marx and Engels, according to Bernstein, was not strictly scientific because it was marred by foggy Hegelian dialectics) with ‘ethical values’ and undemonstrable and irrefutable faith in the transcendental postulates of the ‘good’, of ‘conscience’ of ‘love of one’s neighbour’ and of the whole ‘human race’ without exception, and so on and so forth.

The harm done to the working class movement by the propagation of ‘higher values’ was not, of course, the talk about conscience being good and lack of conscience bad, or about love of the human race being preferable to hatred of it. The harm of the Kantian idea of uniting science with a system of ‘higher’ ethical values consisted in principle in its orienting theoretical thought itself along lines other than those along which the teaching of Marx and Engels had been developed. It plotted its own, Kantian strategy of scientific research for social-democratic theoreticians and confused ideas on the main line of development of theoretical thought and on the lines along which theoretical solution of the real problems of modern times could and should be sought. The Kantian theory of knowledge turned theoretical thinking not to analysis of the material, economic relations between people that form the foundation of the whole pyramid of social relations, but to elaborating of far-fetched ‘ethical’ constructions, morally interpretable policies, and social psychology of the Berdyaev kind, and to other things, which were interesting but absolutely useless (if not harmful) to the working class movement.

The orientation of theoretical thought not on the logic of _Capital_ but on moral-fictional harping on the secondary, derivative defects of the capitalist system in its secondary, superstructural storeys, led to the decisive, dominant trends of the new, imperialist stage of the development of capitalism escaping the notice of the theoreticians of the Second International; not because they lacked talent, but rather because of a petty-bourgeois class orientation and a false epistemological position.

In this respect the fate of Rudolf Hilferding and H. W. C. Cunow was very characteristic. Insofar as they tried to develop Marx’s political economy by means of the ‘latest’ logical devices, rather than of dialectics, it inevitably degenerated into a superficial classificatory description of contemporary economic phenomena, i.e. into a quite uncritical acceptance of them, into an apologia. This path led directly to Karl Renner and his _Theory of the Capitalist Economy,_ the Bible of right-wing socialism, which was already linked, as regards its method of thinking and logic of investigation, with vulgar positivist epistemology. Renner’s philosophical credo was as follows: ‘... Marx’s _Capital_, written in an age far removed from us, with a quite different way of thinking, and a manner of exposition not worked out to the end, with every new decade increases the reader’s difficulties.... The style of writing of the German philosophers has become foreign to us. Marx came from a very philosophical age. Science today no longer proceeds deductively (not only in research but also in presentation), but rather inductively; it starts ‘from experimentally established facts, systematises them and so by degrees arrives at the level of abstract concepts. For an age that is so accustomed to think and to read, the first section of Marx’s principal work presents sheer insuperable difficulty.’

The orientation on ‘modern science’ and the modern way of thinking’, already begun with Bernstein, turned into an orientation on the idealistic and agnostic vogue interpretations of ‘modern science’, on Humean-Berkeleian and Kantian epistemology. Lenin saw that quite clearly. From the middle of the nineteenth century bourgeois philosophy frankly moved ‘back to Kant’, and further back to Hume and Berkeley; and Hegel’s logic, despite all its absolute idealism, was more and more clearly depicted as the pinnacle of the development of all pre-Marxian philosophy in the field of logic understood as the theory of the development of scientific knowledge, _**as the theory of knowledge.**_

Lenin repeatedly stressed that it was only possible to _**move forward**_ from Hegel along one line and one line only, that of a materialist reworking of his achievements, because Hegel’s absolute idealism had really exhausted all the possibilities of idealism as a principle for understanding thought, knowledge, and scientific consciousness. But, because of certain circumstances lying outside science, only Marx and Engels had been able to take that line. It was closed to bourgeois philosophy; and the slogan ‘Back to Kant’ was imperiously dictated by the fear aroused in the bourgeoisie’s ideologists by the social perspectives opened up from the heights of the dialectical view of thought. From the moment the materialist view of history appeared, Hegel was seen by bourgeois consciousness as none other than the ‘spiritual father’ of Marxism. That had a considerable grain of truth, too, for Marx and Engels had disclosed the genuine sense of Hegel’s main achievement, dialectics, and demonstrated not only the constructive, creative power of its principles, understood as the principles of man’s rational attitude to the world, but also their revolutionary, destructive force.

Why then did Lenin, while fighting Hegel’s absolute idealism, begin to join sides with him more and more just at that point where the idealism seemed in fact to become _**absolute?**_ For surely the conception of logic as a science embracing in its principles not only human thought but also the real world outside consciousness was linked with panlogism, with the interpretation of the forms and laws of the real world as alienated forms of thought, and thought itself as the absolute force and power organising the world?

The fact is that Hegel was and remains the sole thinker before Marx who consciously introduced practice into logic with full rights as the criterion both of truth and of the correctness of the operations that man performs in the sphere of the verbal, symbolic explication of his psychic states. In Hegel logic became identified with the theory of knowledge precisely because man’s practice (i.e. realisation of the aims of the ‘spirit’ in sense objects, in natural, physical material was brought into the logical process as a phase, was looked upon as thought in its external revelation, in the course of checking its results through direct contact with ‘things in themselves’.

Lenin traced the development of Hegel’s corresponding ideas with special scrupulousness. ‘... The practice of man and of mankind is the test, the criterion of the objectivity of cognition. Is that Hegel’s idea? It is necessary to return to this,’ he wrote.6 And returning to it, he wrote confidently, and quite categorically: ‘... Undoubtedly, in Hegel practice serves as a link in the analysis of the process of cognition, and indeed as the transition to objective ("absolute", according to Hegel) truth. Marx, consequently, clearly sides with Hegel in introducing the criterion of practice into the theory of knowledge: see the _Theses on Feuerbach_.’

In appearing as a practical act thought included _**things outside consciousness**_ in its movement, and then it turned out that the ‘things in themselves’ were subordinated to the dictates of thinking man and obediently moved and changed according to laws and schemas dictated by his thought. Thus not only did the ‘spirit’ move according to logical schemas, but also the world of ‘things in themselves’. Logic consequently proved to be precisely a theory of knowledge of _**things also,**_ and not solely a theory of the self-knowledge of the spirit.

Formulating the ‘rational kernel’ of Hegel’s conception of the subject matter of logic, Lenin wrote: ‘Logic is the science not of external forms of thought, but of the laws of development "of all material, natural and spiritual things", i.e., of the development of the entire concrete content of the world and of its cognition, i.e., the sum-total, the conclusion of the _**History**_ of knowledge of the world.’

There is no such a formulation, and furthermore no such a _**conception**_ of the subject matter of logic in Hegel himself. In this passage Lenin did not simply translate Hegel’s thought ‘into his own words’, but reworked it materialistically. Hegel’s own text, in which Lenin discovered the ‘rational kernel’ of his conception of logic, does not sound at all like that. Here it is: ‘The indispensable basis, the Concept, the Universal, which is Thought itself – in so far, that is, as in using the word _**Thought**_ one can abstract from the idea – this cannot be regarded as a _**merely**_ indifferent form which is attached to some content. But these thoughts of all natural and spiritual things [Only these words are found in Lenin’s formulation – _EVI_] even the substantial content, are yet such as to possess manifold determinations and to contain the distinction between Soul and Body, between a concept and its respective reality; the deeper basis is the soul in itself, the pure concept, which is the very core of objects, their very life-pulse, as it is the core and pulse of subjective thinking itself. To bring into clear consciousness this _**logical**_ character which gives soul to mind and stirs and works in it, this is our problem.’

The difference between Hegel’s formulation and Lenin’s is one _**of principle,**_ because there is nothing in Hegel about the development of natural things, and could not even be. It would therefore be a gross error to think that the definition of logic as the science of the laws of development of all material and spiritual things is only Hegel’s idea transmitted by Lenin, or even simply cited by him. It is nothing of the sort; it is _**Lenin’s own idea,**_ formulated, by him in the course of a critical reading of Hegel’s words.

_**Hegel’s logic is also his theory of knowledge**_ for the reason that the science of thought was inferred by him from an investigation of the history of the spirit’s self-knowledge, and thus of the world of natural things, since the latter were considered moments of the logical process, schemas of thought, concepts, alienated in natural material.

Logic is also the theory of knowledge of Marxism, but for quite another reason, because the forms themselves of the activity of the ‘spirit’ – the categories and schemas of logic – are inferred from investigation of the history of humanity’s knowledge and practice, i.e. from the process in the course of which thinking man (or rather humanity) cognises and transforms the material world. From that standpoint logic also cannot be anything else than a theory explaining the universal schemas of the development of knowledge and of the material world by social man. _**As such it is also a theory of knowledge**_; any other definition of the tasks of a theory of knowledge inevitably leads to one version or another of the Kantian conception.

In no case, according to Lenin, logic and the theory of knowledge were two different sciences. Even less could logic be defined as part of the theory of knowledge. The logical determinations of thought therefore included exclusively universal categories and laws (schemas) of the development of the objective world in general cognised in the course of the millennia of the development of scientific culture and tested for objectivity in the crucible of social man’s practice, schemas common to both natural and socio-historical development. Being reflected in social consciousness, in mankind’s spiritual culture, they functioned as active logical forms of the work of thought, and logic was a systematic, theoretical depiction of the universal schemas, forms, and laws of development of nature _**and**_ of society, _**and**_ of thought itself.

In this conception, however, logic (i.e. the materialist theory of knowledge) was fully merged without residue in _**dialectics.**_ And once more there were not two sciences, however ‘closely linked’ with one another, but one and the same science, one in subject matter and its stock of concepts. And this, Lenin stressed, was not ‘an aspect of the matter’, but ‘the essence of the matter’. In other words, unless logic was understood simultaneously as the _**theory of knowledge**_, it could not be truly understood.

So logic (the theory of knowledge) and dialectics, according to Lenin, were in a relationship of full identity, full coincidence of subject matter and stock of categories. Dialectics had no subject matter distinct from that of the theory of knowledge (logic), just as logic (the theory of knowledge) had no object of a study that would differ in any way from the subject matter of dialectics. In the one and in the other it was a matter of universal forms and laws of development in general that were reflected in consciousness precisely in the shape of logical forms and laws of thought through the determination of categories. And because categories as schemas of the synthesis of experimental data in concepts had a quite objective significance, the same significance also attached to the ‘experience’ processed with their aid, i.e. to science, the scientific picture of the world, the scientific outlook.

‘Dialectics _**is**_ the theory of knowledge of (Hegel and) Marxism,’ Lenin wrote in is notes ‘_On the Question of Dialectics_’, in which he summed up the vast job he had done in several years of hard work on critically reworking the Hegelian conception of logic in a materialist way. ‘This is the "aspect" of the matter (it is not "an aspect" but the _**essence**_ of the matter) to which Plekhanov, not to speak of other Marxists, paid no attention’. That categorical conclusion, hardly admitting of any other interpretation than a literal one, must not be considered as a phrase dropped by chance, but as a real resume of all Lenin’s understanding of the problem of the relationship of dialectics, logic, and the theory of knowledge of modern materialism.

In the light of the foregoing, attempts to interpret their relation in the body of Marxism in such a way that dialectics is transformed into a special category treating ‘pure forms of being’, and logic and the theory of knowledge into special sciences connected with dialectics but not, however, merged with it, and devoted exclusively to the ‘specific’ forms of the reflexion of this ontology in men’s consciousness – the one (epistemology) being devoted to the ‘specific’ forms of knowledge and the other (logic) to the ‘specific’ forms of discursive thought – proved to be bankrupt (and in no way linked with Lenin’s conception).

The idea whereby logic is distinguished from dialectics as the particular from the general and therefore studies just that ‘specific feature’ of thought from which dialectics digresses, is based on a simple misunderstanding, on neglect of the fact that the ‘specific nature’ of the forms and laws of thought consists precisely in their universality.

Logic as a science is not at all interested in the ‘specific features’ of the thinking of the physicist or chemist, economist or linguist, but only in those universal (invariant) forms and laws within which the thinking of any person flows, and of any theoretician, including the logician by profession, who specially thinks about thought. From the angle of materialism, therefore, logic also investigates forms and laws that equally govern both thinking about the external world and thinking about thought itself, and is thus the science of the universal forms and patterns of thought and reality; so that the statement that logic must study the ‘specific forms’ of the movement of thought as well as the universal ones (common to thought and being), in fact ignores the historically formed division of labour between logic and psychology, depriving psychology of its subject matter, and throwing onto logic a task that is too much for it.

To understand logic as a science distinguished from dialectics (though closely connected with it) means to understand both logic and dialectics incorrectly, and not in a materialist way; because logic, artificially separated from dialectics, is inevitably converted into a description of purely subjective methods and operations, i.e. of forms of activities depending on the will and consciousness of people, and on the peculiarities of the material, and therefore ceases to be an objective science. While dialectics, counterposed to the process of the development of knowledge (thought), in the form of a doctrine about ‘the world as a whole’, in the form of ‘world schematics’ is just as inevitably converted into extremely general statements about everything on earth and not about anything in particular (something of the sort of that ‘everything in nature and society is interconnected’, or that ‘everything develops’ and even ‘through contradictions’, and so on).

Dialectics, understood so, is tacked on to the real process of cognition in a purely formal way, through examples ‘confirming’ one and the same general proposition over and over again. But it is clear that such a formal superimposition of the general onto the particular does not deepen our understanding of either the general or the particular by a single jot, while dialectics is transformed into a dead scheme. Lenin therefore quite justly considered the transformation of dialectics into a sum of examples as the inevitable consequence of not understanding it as the logic and theory of knowledge of materialism.

Being the science of the universal forms and patterns within which any process, either objective or subjective, takes place, logic is a rigorously defined system of special concepts (logical categories) reflecting the stages (‘steps’) consecutively passed through in the formation of any concrete whole (or correspondingly of the process of its mental-theoretical reproduction). The sequence of the development of the categories in the body of a theory has an objective character, i.e. does not depend on the will and consciousness of people. It is dictated primarily by the objective sequence of the development of empirically based theoretical knowledge, in the form of which, the objective sequence of the real historical process, purged of its disruptive fortuities and of the historical form, is reflected in people’s consciousness.

Logical categories are thus directly stages in distinguishing the world, i.e. of cognising it, and nodal points helping to cognise and master it.

In explaining this view Lenin remarked on the general sequence of the development of logical categories: ‘First of all impressions _**flash by,**_ then _**Something**_ emerges—afterwards the concepts of _**quality**_ (the determination of the thing or the phenomenon) and _**quantity**_ are developed. After that study and reflection direct thought to the cognition of identity—difference—Ground—Essence versus phenomenon—causality, etc. All these moments (steps, stages, processes) of cognition move ... from subject to object, being tested in practice and arriving through this test at truth.’ ‘Such is actually the _**general course of**_ all human cognition (of all science) in general. Such is the course also of _**natural science**_ and _**political economy**_ (and history)." The _**movement**_ of scientific cognition, Lenin said, was the nub.

Logical categories are stages (steps) in cognition developing the object in its necessity, in the natural sequence of the phases of its own formation, and not at all man’s technical devices imposed on the subject like a child’s bucket on sandpies. Not only do the determinations of each of the logical categories therefore have an objective character, i.e. determine the object and not simply the form of subjective activity, but the sequence in which the categories appear in the theory of thought also has the same necessary character. It is impossible to determine necessity or purpose strictly scientifically, on an objective basis, before and independently of the scientific determination of identity and difference, quality and measure, etc., just as it is impossible to understand capital and profit scientifically unless their ‘simple components’ – commodity and money have previously been analysed, and just as it is impossible to understand the complex compounds of organic chemistry while their constituent chemical elements are unknown (not identified by analysis).

In outlining a plan for systematic treatment of the categories of logic, Lenin noted: ‘If Marx did not leave behind him a Logic (with a capital ‘L’), he did leave the _**logic of Capital,**_ and this ought to be utilised to the full in this question.’ Moreover, one can only distinguish the logical categories underlying the theory of political economy from the movement of the theory by basing oneself on the best (dialectical) traditions in the development of logic as a science. ‘It is impossible completely to understand Marx’s _Capital_, and especially its first chapter, without having thoroughly studied and understood the _**whole**_ of Hegel’s Logic.’ ‘In his _Capital,’_ Lenin wrote further, ‘Marx first analyses the simplest, most ordinary and fundamental, most common and everyday _relation_ of bourgeois (commodity) society, a relation encountered billions of times, viz. the exchange of commodities. In this very simple phenomenon (in this "cell" of bourgeois society) analysis reveals _all_ the contradictions (or the germs of _all_ the contradictions) of modern society. The subsequent exposition shows us the development (**_both_** growth **_and_** movement) of these contradictions and of this society in the Σ [summation] of its individual parts, from its beginning to its end.

Notes on Dialectics: PART II  
The Hegelian Logic

### The Doctrine of Being

---

  

#### PRELIMINARY EXERCISES

You know, as I propose to myself to begin the actual _Logic_, I feel a slight chill. The Doctrine of Being. Harris, who ultimately wrote a very fine work on the Hegelian Logic, was a professor of philosophy and lecturer on Hegel at second-hand. Brockmeyer, Governor of Missouri, made a translation of the larger _Logic_ and someone gave it to Harris. Harris says that he copied out the thing with his own hand, the whole thing, and when he was finished, he didn't understand a line, not a line. I know exactly how he felt.

What I propose to do is to use the Doctrine of Being as a means of getting practice in the style and habit of Hegel. The larger _Logic_ is the most difficult book I know. Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ is child's play compared to it. But we have to be able to handle it. So while we shall get the main points of the Doctrine of Being, look upon this as a kind of basic training, before we get down to it in the Doctrine of Essence. I am _not_ giving a summary of the _Logic_. I am not expanding it as a doctrine. I am using it and showing how to begin to know it and use it.

Think of the world of human beings, nearly two billions, more than that perhaps. What is the simplest thing you can say about them? They exist. Two billion people exist. So what! To say that is to say – nothing. To say something so broad, so complete, so _abstract_, is to say nothing. Something must happen, must come out of this abstraction. I say: some men work. The previous abstraction has now _become_ something. Some men work. Let us look at the men who work. They at once, by being distinguished, create another category, the people who do not work. You cannot separate one category without creating another one. To create a category is to “determine” something. But every time you determine something, you negate something. Every time. By determining men who work, we negate them as men who merely exist, but we also negate the men who do not work. They are no longer men who merely exist. That is over. They are men who do not work. Whenever you do something, you at the same time do _not_ do something else. A silver coin on a green table negated the green cover on the particular spot where it rests. It creates the spot where the coin is and the spot where the coin is not.

Now we have men who work. That is the quality which distinguishes them. When something “becomes” out of the mass it has a “quality". The quality we take is work. But as you pile up the men who work, you catalogue them, work is not enough. Some are tailors, some shoemakers, some cowboys, some engineers. The list is endless. Some work well, some badly. Some work well but stay at home every morning. We soon find ourselves concerned with more than quality. We find that we must look not at quality but at _quantity_ of work. Preoccupation with quality has led us to _quantity_. But quantity too is limited. The more you contemplate it, deal with it, you find that it is impossible to keep tab of the quantity of work of tailors, cooks, deep-sea divers by measuring work in the abstract. You have to get some common _measure_. The three divisions of the Doctrine of Being are Quality, Quantity, and Measure.

This is a crude, but in my opinion, quite adequate, example of Hegel's method. That is what I am after. Kant and the others would know and use Quality, Quantity, and Measure. What Hegel insisted upon is that these are connected, that one developed out of the other. Quantity came at a certain time because quality upon quality does not go on being quality but at a certain stage becomes something new. Hegel takes Quality and Quantity as abstractions to represent processes present in all aspects of nature, society and thought. Water is a quality, a small stream negates the surrounding land. It is a stream because it is no longer land. If it grows and grows, it becomes a river, and a number of rivers meeting in one place can become an inland sea.

Hegel's own categories are much more profound, of course. He says: think not of men, but of everything that exists, that has some “being". Think of the whole world not as men, land, sky, horses, air, buildings. Just think of it in its capacity of existing. Pure absolute being. Good. But when you think that, you are thinking – nothing. Pure being – pure nothing. Something emerges, it “becomes” and you have “being determinate". It has a quality. But a coin on a table negates some of the table. So that “Determinate Being” is Being-for-self but _always_ being-for-another. Men who work are one being, being-for-self, but they are also automatically being-for-another, men-who-do-not-work. Quality means that a _limit_ is imposed, a _barrier_ between itself and its other.

[If we take a closer look at what a limit implies, we see it involving a contradiction in itself, and thus evincing its dialectical nature. On the one side limit makes the reality of a thing; on the other it is its negation. But, again, the limit, as the negation of something, is not an abstract nothing but a nothing which is – what we call an “other". Given something, and up starts an other to us: we know that there is not something only, but an other as well. Nor, again, is the other of such a nature that we can think something apart from it; a something is implicitly the other of itself, and the somewhat sees its limit become objective to it in the other. If we now ask for the difference between something and another, it turns out that they are the same: which sameness is expressed in Latin by calling the pair _aliad-aliud_. The other, as opposed to the something, is itself a something, and hence we say some other, or something else; and so on the other hand the first something when opposed to the other, also defined as something, is itself an other. When we say “something else” our first impression is that something taken separately is only something, and that the quality of being another attaches to it only from outside considerations. Thus we suppose that the moon, being something else than the sun, might very well exist without the sun. But really the moon, as a something, has its other implicit in it. Plato says: God made the world out of the nature of the “one” and the “other": having brought these together, he formed from them a third, which is of the nature of the “one” and the “other". In these words we have in general terms a statement of the nature of the finite, which, as something, does not meet the nature of the other as if it had no affinity to it, but, being implicitly the other of itself, thus undergoes alteration. Alteration thus exhibits the inherent contradiction which originally attaches to determinate being, and which forces it out of its own bounds.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL92n)

[... But the fact is, mutability lies in the notion of existence, and change is only the manifestation of what it implicitly is. The living die, simply because as living they bear in themselves the germ of death.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL92n1)

That is the core of the Doctrine of Being. Something immediately involves something else. Continue with something like quality, and its other, quantity, will take form. A completely abstract something is the same as nothing, that is its other. Something “Becomes” out of nothing. It always has its limit, its barrier. And this limit, barrier, is burst through, at a certain stage, to establish the other, its other. All this takes place in the sphere of determinate being, simple quality.

Let me take an example of what the method of the _Logic_ signifies. The proletariat politically is an undistinguished body of proletarians. Something “becomes". Some of them form a party. At once the proletariat is no longer party and proletarians. It is party and non-party, or as we say, party and mass. The party creates its other, the mass. But you can have one, two, three, four parties. One obvious way to distinguish is by size. That is not sufficient, however. For political purposes we can judge by “support", a form of quantity. But support changes. Out of support we can arrive at what in the last analysis decided support – policy. That is a form of Measure. Whenever you examine any object, you can begin by looking for its obvious distinguishing quality, the quantity of _this_ quality, and the measure of it.

Bit by bit we go a step further, like an experienced man bringing along a virgin who has willingly consented. Grace is probably tearing her hair at the vulgarity of some of my illustrations. They are better than the perpetual water turning into steam which everybody uses from Engels. But I don't want to leave it there. For us Doctrine of Being is a road to practise to get familiar with the method, the concrete method, the method of dealing with Hegel's matter and manner. Do not be misled by the extract I have given you from the smaller _Logic_. There he is being friendly, considerate and kind. In the larger _Logic_ he is ruthless. He puts down the most difficult, complicated idea in a clause of three words. He creates terms, three, four, five, and uses them as if they were letters of the alphabet. So let us use this interlude as training. Now for this quality into quantity business. Hegel uses the One and the Many as his illustration.

Common sense thinks one is one, and over here, and many is some, and over there. In other words. One has a special _quality_, and they begin there and stay there. Hegel says No. Philosophy tells us that One presupposes Many. The moment I say One, I have thereby created the category Many. In fact it is the existence of the Many which makes the One possible at all. If there were no Many, One would be whatever you wish but it would not be One meaning this one, in contrast with many others. The One therefore is _repellent_. To be, it repels the Many. It is _exclusive_, but it is not quiescent. It is actively repelling the Many, for otherwise its specific quality as One would be lost. This is _Repulsion_. But, all the other Ones who constitute the Many have a connecting relation with it. They thereby have a connective relation with each other; the One, by holding them all off, makes them all join together against it. But each of these is a One, too. Thus the One begins by Repulsion but creates in every other single One an attraction. Thus, the One when you begin with it is a Quality, but by examining first and following what is involved to the end, you turn up with a new category, Quantity, with the original pure and simple Quality suppressed and superseded.

Here is the complete extract:

[The One, as already remarked, just is self-exclusion and explicit putting itself as the Many. Each of the Many however is itself a One, and in virtue of its so behaving, this all rounded repulsion is by one stroke converted into its opposite – Attraction.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL97n)

The thing that Hegel insists upon is not to see the One as fixed, finite, limited, isolated. It is One because there are Many, and because of that the original category of One begins to assume new facets and suddenly they are the very opposite of what you began with. As Hegel knows and says you can (if you want to) make a lot of jokes about these transitions. His fundamental answer is that you have to go along with him and see where you get and what you get. Anyone who has had a class on _Capital_ knows that there are certain types who passionately contest every sentence, every deduction. In the end they always turn up in the bourgeois camp. It is the revolution they are fighting. The Hegelian categories offer infinite opportunity for this. We, however, not only have our past traditions. We have had a very substantial introduction here, and can afford to follow him. As a matter of fact, few people challenge the broad divisions of the Doctrine of Being. I have seen these basic premises challenged, but the writer said that if you admitted those, you could not seriously oppose him after.

Now let Hegel himself speak. I give some lengthy extracts from the smaller _Logic_.

[The transition from Quality to Quantity, indicated in the paragraph before us, is not found in our ordinary way of thinking which deems each of these categories to exist independently beside the other. We are in the habit of saying that things are not merely qualitatively, but also quantitatively defined; but whence these categories originate, and how they are related to each other, are questions not further examined. The fact is, quantity just means quality superseded and absorbed: and it is by the dialectic of quality here examined that this supersession is effected. First of all, we had being: as the truth of Being, came Becoming: which formed the passage to Being Determinate: and the truth of that we found to be Alteration. And in its result Alteration showed itself to be Being-for-self, exempt from implication of another and from passage into another; which Being-for-self finally in the two sides of its process, Repulsion and Attraction, was clearly seen to annul itself, and thereby to annul quality in the totality of its stages. Still this superseded and absorbed quality is neither an abstract nothing, nor an equally abstract and featureless being: it is only being as indifferent to determinateness or character. This aspect of being is also what appears as quantity in our ordinary conceptions. We observe things, first of all, with an eye to their quality – which we take to be the character identical with the being of the thing. If we proceed to consider their quantity, we get the conception of an indifferent and external character or mode, of such a kind that a thing remains what it is though its quantity is altered, and the thing becomes greater or less](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL98n2).

Then he works through Quantity and arrives at Measure. These he sums up so far:

[Thus quantity by means of the dialectical movement so far studied through its several stages, turns out to be a return to quality. The first notion of quantity presented to us was that of quality abrogated and absorbed. That is to say, quantity seemed an external character not identical with Being, to which it is quite immaterial This notion, as we have seen, underlies the mathematical definition of magnitude as what can be increased or diminished. At first sight this definition may create the impression that quantity is merely whatever can be altered – increase and diminution alike implying determination of magnitude otherwise – and may tend to confuse it with determinate Being, the second stage of quality, which in its notion is similarly conceived as alterable. We can, however, complete the definition by adding, that in quantity we have an alterable, which in spite of alterations still remains the same. The notion of quantity, it thus turns out, implies an inherent contradiction. This contradiction is what forms the dialectic of quantity. The result of the dialectic however is not a mere return to quality, as if that were the true and quantity the false notion, but an advance to the unity and truth of both, to qualitative quantity, or Measure](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slquant.htm#SL106n).

This is worth pondering over, it is not too difficult. There Hegel says something which he often repeats, as I have shown before. Men it seems could be as stupid then as now. He is talking about Nature where simple determinate being, quality, abounds. Measure is a very _low_ stage of the dialectical logic. And Hegel says:

[It may be well therefore at this point to observe that whenever in our study of the objective world we are engaged in quantitative determinations, it is in all cases Measure which we have in view, as the goal of our operations This is hinted at even in language, when the ascertainment of quantitative features and relations is called measuring](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slquant.htm#SL106n1).

Now come two splendid examples of the dialectical relation between quality, quantity, and measure:

[We measure, e.g. the length of different chords that have been put into a state of vibration, with an eye to the qualitative difference of the tones caused by their vibration, corresponding to this difference of length. Similarly, in chemistry, we try to ascertain the quantity of the matters brought into combination, in order to find out the measures or proportions conditioning such combination, that is to say, those quantities which give rise to definite qualities](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slquant.htm#SL106n2).

Then comes a really superb passage in which you see what the _Logic_ meant to him and how he used it. It is very long. But this is in its way an anthology and I would like it in:

[The identity between quantity and quality, which is found in Measure, is at first only implicit, and not yet explicitly realised. In other words, these two categories, which unite in Measure, each claim an independent authority. On the one hand, the quantitative features of existence may be altered, without affecting its quality. On the other hand, this increase and diminution, immaterial though it be, has its limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change. Thus the temperature of water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its liquidity: still with the increase of diminution of the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where this state of cohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice. A quantitative change takes place, apparently without any further significance: but there is something lurking behind, and a seemingly innocent change of quantity acts as a kind of snare, to catch hold of the quality. The antinomy of Measure which this implies was exemplified under more than one garb among the Greeks. It was asked, for example, whether a single grain makes a heap of wheat, or whether it makes a bald-tail to tear out a single hair from the horse's tail. At first, no doubt, looking at the nature of quantity as an indifferent and external character of being, we are disposed to answer these questions in the negative. And yet, as we must admit, this indifferent increase and diminution has its limit: a point is finally reached, where a single additional grain makes a heap of wheat; and the bald-tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs. These examples find a parallel in the story of the peasant who, as his ass trudged cheerfully along, went on adding ounce after ounce to its load, till at length it sunk under the unendurable burden. It would be a mistake to treat these examples as pedantic futility; they really turn on thoughts, an acquaintance with which is of great importance in practical life, especially in ethics. Thus in the matter of expenditure, there is a certain latitude within which a more or less does not matter; but when the Measure, imposed by the individual circumstances of the special case, is exceeded on the one side or the other, the qualitative nature of Measure (as in the above examples of the different temperature of water) makes itself felt, and a course, which a moment before was held good economy, turns into avarice or prodigality. The same principles may be applied in politics, when the constitution of a state has to be looked at as independent of, no less than as dependent on, the extent of its territory, the number of its inhabitants, and other quantitative points of the same kind. If we look, e.g. at a state with a territory of ten thousand square miles and a population of four millions we should, without hesitation, admit that a few square miles of land or a few thousand inhabitants more or less could exercise no essential influence on the character of its constitution. But on the other hand, we must not forget that by the continual increase or diminishing of a state, we finally get to a point where, apart from all other circumstances, this quantitative alteration alone necessarily draws with it an alteration in the quality of the constitution. The constitution of a little Swiss canton does not suit a great kingdom; and, similarly, the constitution of the Roman republic was unsuitable when transferred to the small imperial towns of Germany](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL108n).

That is about all we need.

Now for a little recapitulation and a jumping-off place into Essence. Being means quality, determinate being. It comes out of Nothing. It deals with the categories of other determinate beings that one determinate being automatically creates. But Measure as the last stage of such Being which creates other over there. The dialectic of Measure leads it into Essence, where being is no longer simply determinate. It is _reflected_. We now begin to see an object whose parts are separated by thought. One part creates an other, true, but the other is inherent in the object itself, not one object here and another over there, but the object splits into related categories that are both contained within the object itself.

This has been very quiet, very easy. The smaller _Logic_ is worth reading on the Doctrine of Being in particular. I have purposely kept the pitch low. Just read and get acquainted. For after this we are going to begin to go places and it is going to be hectic.

### The Doctrine of Essence

---

#### ESSENCE IS A MOVEMENT OF NEGATION

Here goes then, right into the heart of it, and take the worst first. Brace yourself:

[Becoming in Essence – its reflective movement – is hence the movement from Nothing to Nothing and through Nothing back to itself. The transition or Becoming transcends itself in its transition: that Other which arises in the course of this transition is not the Not-being of a Being, but the Nothing of a Nothing – which constitutes Being – Being exists only as the movement of Nothing to Nothing, and thus is Essence; and Essence does not contain this movement in itself but is this movement, an absolute Show and pure negativity, which has nothing without it that could negate it, but negates only its own negativity, which is only in this negation.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl399.htm#HL2_400)

It is as tough a passage as you can have. Yet we can break its back. Just try to remember. Hegel _must_ write this way. If he said, as we do, the labour movement this and that, or atomic energy, or the theory of the state, he would at once _limit_ himself. The reader would think of this as _politics_ or whatever it was Hegel had chosen. The movement would be from politics to something else, then to something else, and so on _ad infinitum_. Besides it would, I _feel_ sure, limit his freedom of analysis. He examines instead an infinite number of processes, studies the relation between stages, and extracts, abstracts the essential movement. Besides, as I read him, I get the impression that from the study of phenomena and the methods of other philosophers he had learnt to handle these abstractions by themselves, and as a man does in mathematics, push them further by their own movement. So they have to be accepted as valid.

We are to take this passage _all_ ways, worry it like a dog. What is the central idea? The thing that I want you to notice is where he says Essence does not contain a movement, but is that movement.

Imagine a spirit, a genie Ariel, a disembodied being flitting around in the spiritual void. He does not know who he is or what he is. But he wants to find out and he has been told that inside his spiritual constellation are a number of elements which periodically explode into an object, stone, flower, horse, ape, man, etc. He gets a chance in these to see what he really is. But he will know whether this is the real thing or not. If after a while he feels that this is not the real thing he dissolves it and he steps back again into a pure spirit. His only way of knowing anything about himself is to become one of the things that is in him. The day he becomes something and knows, feels, that this is it, then he is something new at last. He has we may say a notion of his true self at last. But, except as something that has become something for a while, he himself is a pure spirit, abstract, waiting in those cold regions.

The essence is the fact that something continually becomes something else and negates it because it isn't what the thing that is becoming wants to be. This “being” that it becomes, we know from the Doctrine of Being has “become” out of Nothing. All immediate being comes out of Nothing and can go back to nothing. The difference with Essence is that it creates a lot of different beings; they go back to nothing, but essence keeps on trying, for poor Essence is the fact that he has to keep on trying. He is a kind of being that does not rest at becoming nothing but from his very nature must keep on trying and trying again. We can now go back to the passage and concentrate on certain things.

Now we can do a _loose_ paraphrase. (As far as Essence is concerned, the process of becoming is being, that is to say it comes from nothing, stays as being for a while and goes back to nothing, but thereby gets back to itself, which is the imperative necessity to “become” once more.) _Ordinary_ being is the movement of nothing to being-for-other and going on, or maybe, just becoming and disappearing, and that's that. But Essence tries again. So that the being in which Essence tries to find itself is pure Show; it does not become a quality, which becomes a quantity, which becomes a Measure, etc. No, sir. Pure Show. Absolute Negativity. Show No. 1. No good. Negated. Show No. 2. Not what I am looking for – out with it into limbo. Show No. 3. No good. Negate it. Negate them all. One day we'll get to it (and we'll see a lot of things which we could not see before). But for the time being Essence can truly say, “Me! I know what I am by now. I am just Negativity, becoming something and negating it. I am a movement, me. Yes, that's it. I am movement of negation. But that isn't all of me. One day I'll find out.” Essence of course does not know that there is a logic to his negativity. A philosopher, a Hegelian philosopher, who was watching him through an atomic microscope would say: first he was a stone, then he was a flower, then he was a horse, then he was an ape, then he was a man. The poor abstraction doesn't know it, but I think one day he will be an angel. That's what all this restlessness and negativity must mean. But that of course does not concern us here.

Now from there into the labour movement.

We know what the labour movement is. It was at one time the 1848 revolutions, including Chartism, 1839-48. It took the form of the First International. It took the form of the Second International at its highest peak. The unions were also organised. There are asses who would say: the Commune, for example, took place in one city, how can you say that was a form of the whole labour movement? Think of all the millions and millions who had no connection with the Commune. Fools. Since 1917 the labour movement in country after country has repeatedly tried to imitate the Commune. Europe and Asia seethe with would-be Communards. So it is obvious that the Commune (in a single city) showed the pattern of the future – to the millions and millions in the hundreds and thousands of cities who perhaps paid little attention to the Commune – which was a form of nothing in particular. The Commune represented them.

So these forms show the labour movement going somewhere. But the 1848 revolutions, they came and went, the Commune came and went. The First International came and went. The Second International remains, but is a relic. Look at it in France – the Third Force. It is a joke. In France the two forces are De Gaulle and the Third International. Who chooses to bother himself about the Second International and Catholic workers is in the same position as those who did not understand that it was the Commune and not the apparently inert millions that was decisive for the future of Europe. Marx pounced on it.

But, as I say, these forms disappear. But the proletarian _movement_ continues. They have an external being, and these vanish, the new external forms appear. We can always, if we are Marxists, see the form and what for the moment we will call the Essence. But the Essence is not _one_ thing that changes. No, the form was the First International; the essence was the labour, the proletarian, the revolutionary movement of 1871, which was different from that of 1848. And we have established that the revolutionary movement today, the workers that follow Stalinism, are not the _same_ workers who followed Menshevism. They are further advanced qualitatively, further advanced along the road of their ultimate goal.

The Commune, therefore, the First International, the 1905 struggles were just Being, they were Nothing. They did not exist, they existed, they did not exist any more. They were from nothing and went back to nothing. But their experience, what they represented _was stored up_. It was not lost. Essence is a movement but a movement of stored up Being. The workers under Stalinism have the experience of Leninism. “Essence we may certainly regard as past Being, remembering however meanwhile that the past is not utterly denied, but only laid aside and thus at the same time preserved.”

The reactionary Third International has, stored up in it, the past being of Leninism which is gone – it exists no longer. Philosophers, Marxists, have to trace this.

The thing that continues to move, however, is the labour movement, the revolutionary movement itself. It stored up the experience of the follies and weaknesses of Proudhonism and Bakuninism. It learnt the value of organisation. It stored up the experience of parliamentarianism, national defence, etc. It became richer and richer. (It organised the ideas too, but always as a result of the objective movement, _changing_, _developing_ capitalism.)

At a given moment, this proletarian movement looks like the First International or the Commune or 1917-20. And if you stop, look at it, and be precise about it, _as you have to do_ (remember you cannot think unless you have fixed and precise determinations), then you see that the essential movement is _reflected_ in the form. The First International reflected it, 1915 reflected it, etc. The reflections disappear. What they reflected is stored up and becomes part of the new proletariat. This process, the disappearance of the reflection, and the new proletariat with its experience of the reflection stored up in it, starting off again, this _process_ is Essence. The essence of a thing is the fact that it must move, reflect itself, negate the reflection, which was nothing, become being, and then become nothing again, while the thing itself must move on because it is its nature to do so. That it must move, the consistent direction in which it moves, its necessity to negate its reflections, store them up, and go on to some ultimate goal, this is its Essence. The essence of the proletariat is its movement to incorporate in itself experience of the evils of capitalism until it overcomes capitalism itself. The essence of the proletariat is not that it is revolutionary and tries a lot of different parties and rejects them because they fail. It is not “an existent substratum”. It negates not only its reflection, it does more than that, it further negates its own experiences and stores them up, so it is always further than it was before in its own special purpose. Nor does it negate in general. (The quote will show.) Its negation is a specific negation of its own contradictions, inherent in capitalism and therefore inherent in it as inseparable from and in fact unthinkable except as an opposite to capitalism. And now, sentence by sentence.

[Becoming in Essence – its reflective moment – is hence the movement from Nothing to Nothing and through Nothing back to itself.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl399.htm#HL2_400)

Obvious. Commune, First International, Leninism, all, as existing entities, all pure being. The proletariat had a being, a certain feeling, ideas, impulses, desires, will. It gained these in its experience, objective experience with capitalism, with its past stored-up being. This was abstract being, abstract proletarian being. But abstract being is Nothing. The Nature of being is to become determinate. Just as thought organises impulses, desire, will, etc., the proletarian party organises itself, becomes determinate in Lenin, Bukharin, Trotsky, Rakovsky, the Bolshevik Party, the Third International, determinate being.

Leninism, therefore, the Third International, is a crystallisation of abstract being, which is Nothing. Leninism negates this nothing by becoming something. Then it is superseded by Stalinism. But the fact that this takes place is the essence of the proletariat. Its desires, will, impulses, needs (basically implanted in it by its position _vis-a-vis_ capitalism) are always first abstract being, i.e., nothing, then take determinate form, then these vanish back into nothing, but their essence is stored up. The proletariat, in essence, has an Other, its reflection, but this just comes and goes.

[The transition or Becoming transcends itself in its transition: that Other which arises in the course of this transition is not the Not being of a Being, but the Nothing of a Nothing; and it is this – the fact that it is the negation of a Nothing – which constitutes being.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl399.htm#HL2_400a)

This is an exercise in the development of the ideas of the Doctrine of Being. This passage contains the key. Read it slowly and get it:

[Being exists only as the movement of Nothing to Nothing, and thus is Essence- and Essence does not contain this movement in itself but is this movement, an absolute Show and pure negativity, which has nothing without it that could negate it, but negates only its own negativity, which is only in this negation.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl399.htm#HL2_400b)

So that looking back we can see that we had one kind of being in quality, immediate being, which went its own way. Now we have another kind of being, Essence, which has its way, constant negativity of the Show, in which it must find itself. The rest of Essence is to trace the dialectical development of this Show, and the movement that constantly negates it. (I do not guarantee these interpretations. The point is once they are down we begin to Bet somewhere. I am not afraid of mistakes.)

So now we have Essence. It is a form of _Reflection_. As Hegel describes it in the smaller _Logic_:

[This word “reflection” is originally applied when a ray of light in a straight line impinging upon the surface of a mirror is thrown back from it. In this phenomenon we have two things, first an immediate fact which is, and secondly the deputed, derivated, or transmitted phase of the same. Something of this sort takes place when we reflect, or think upon an object; for here we want to know the object, not in its immediacy, but as derivative or mediated.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#reflection)

Mediated. A lovely word. Hug it to your bosom. I say, we say that people's consciousness is one thing, immediacy, an entity that we can say has “quality”. But as Marxists we know that consciousness is _in essence_ the reflection of economic and political, i.e. social environment. The social background, therefore, is _mediated_ through consciousness. In the doctrine of Being, quality was, if you like, mediated into quantity. In the Doctrine of Essence quality is, or rather would be a Show of something which is reflecting itself through quality. Hegel goes on:

[The problem or aim of philosophy is often represented as the ascertainment of the essence of things: a phrase which only means that things instead of being left in their immediacy, must be shown to be mediated by, or based upon, something else. The immediate Being of things is thus conceived under the image of a rind or curtain behind which the Essence lies hidden.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#SL112na)

The maestro is taking it easy. “[Everything, it is said, has an Essence; that is, things really are not what they immediately show themselves. There is something more to be done than merely rove from one quality to another, and merely to advance from qualitative to quantitative and vice versa: there is a permanent in things and that permanent is in the first instance their Essence.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#SL112n_1)”

That is simple enough. Why didn't I begin with it? No. Because that simple phrase “in the first instance” covers a lot and it would have given us a lot of trouble. You would have believed you understood something which you did not. The essence of consciousness is social environment. But you get there an impression that is static. It is only because consciousness is a kind of show, which must reflect environment, and environment _must_ go on expressing itself, forever seeking, can we call it Essence. The importance of this cannot be overestimated. If you do not see that clearly, you get the conception of trying this, trying that, trying the other. You soon say: it never seems to learn, because “it” is static. Then your essence becomes a thing. But when you see Essence as the movement, and the movement which stores up the superseded being, but yet is impelled to go on, then you have Essence in truth and in fact.

Now to know that Essence is a movement which reflects into a Show (which is dismissed) and then goes off again, to know this is only to know Essence in general. This is the beginning of Essence. Essence, a movement, moves on dialectically. The reflection and the thing reflected have their own life; they develop into different things and we trace them, and see how at each stage they change into something else. Hegel calls their most important form the Reflections of Determinations. Remember that for a long time they are creations of thought. For example, when you look at consciousness, you do not see it divided into consciousness and existence, to use Marx's word. Consciousness is consciousness. Thought, however, makes this separation, these determinations of the object, into its component parts.

We see Leninism as a determination which reflects a certain stage of development of the perpetual movement. But Leninism is a thought-determination. There is the proletariat, in capitalist society, at a certain stage of development. To isolate what we call Leninism is a determination of thought. To isolate it as a fact and give it an independent life of its own, ah! Jesus, that is something that brings a terrible retribution. Listen to Hegel even before he begins to develop the Determinations of Reflection, telling us how certain people get stuck:

[. . . the reflected determinations are of a kind different from the merely immediate determinations of Being. Of the latter it is easily admitted that they are transitory and merely relative, related to something other, while the reflected determinations have the form of Being-in-and-for-Self. They accordingly assert themselves as essential, and instead of passing over into their opposites, they appear rather as absolute, free, and indifferent to one another. They therefore stubbornly resist their movement: their Being is their selfidentity in their determinateness, according to which, while presupposing one another, they yet preserve themselves as absolutely separate in this relation.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl399.htm#HL2_405)

Leninism is Leninism and Stalinism is Stalinism; the Fourth International is the Fourth International. This is giving them the form of Being-in-and-for-Self. The above extract poses _the_ problem. There is no need to take everything sentence by sentence. A looser interpretation is here indicated. (And Hegel will sing this song for nearly five hundred pages .) If you look at the “immediate” determinations of being, you see Leninism, and you say: it will pass; things come and go. l remember the French consul in an island where I stayed who told me that the French politician Briand was a socialist in his youth, but there _always_ arise people more to the left than you, which pushes you to the right. That idea appears to have movement, but it takes Briand and those “more left” than he as “immediates”- The reflection is external.

And Hegel (in the complete extract – I have left out some of the paragraph) says it is easy for serious thinkers to throw these external determinations aside. But when you think _seriously_, see the apparent being as merely reflections of essence, then these determinations become themselves _essential_. The Commune, the Second International, Leninism, Stalinism, etc., become “free”. They become independent of life. They live on after they are dead, and what does live on is dead – for Understanding. You see, you _know_ you are a superior thinker. These determinations you have traced to their roots. They “presuppose” one another “of course”. Leninism is “in a way” connected with Menshevism, and Stalinism comes from Leninism. They are in inseparable connection with developing capitalism and the developing proletariat. “Of course, of course”, but yet they _are_ kept “separate”. The individual thinker, having worked hard, overcome vulgar common sense, and established these, holds tight on to them. His creative energy is exhausted. Or his energy for organisation of concrete things is such that he throws himself into organisation within these categories. He would ordinarily do little harm. But when these marvellous, new categories were established, they came from the impulses, will, desire, etc., of people. And there are always some people who, for _objective reasons_, wish to stay right there. They catch hold of this individual and make him a hero. The Logic of Understanding has a base.

But there are some even _more_ pathetic cases, and as I think of this, I am moved to tears. There is the powerful intellect and spirit which moves in categories that, once powerful in their day, now have no objective base. What wasted effort! What vain sacrifices! Hegel knew. All the time he keeps saying: “That is the enemy, thinking in the categories which were precise, but acquire independent life and do not move.” He is going to tell us about opposites and transition. That is the main content of Essence. But before he begins he says that this Understanding type of thought can strangle us before we can get started.

## Identity, Difference and Contradiction, especially Contradiction

We now approach the core of Hegel's system, in the three noted above. It must not, however, be forgotten that the larger _Logic_ is nine hundred pages in all. Take for example the question of Ground which follows these three. Ground, says Hegel, is the real self-mediation of Essence. OK. And then he is off. Absolute Ground which is further determined into Determined Ground, which he further analyses into Formal Ground and Real Ground, which finally ends up as Complete Ground. But the sub-divisions of Absolute Ground alone are (a) Form and Essence, (b) Form and Matter, (c) Form and Content. It is thirty-four pages in all. What the hell can we do with that? And yet it contains such crucial things as Form and Content, Existence, Appearance, Substance, and so on and on. You will read it for yourselves. My selections are arbitrary. We take bits. But in reality there are no arbitrary selections. _My_ purpose, _my_ knowledge of the _Logic_, _my_ knowledge of the labour movement, my knowledge of my probable readers, are all at work deciding which bits I shall take. If my knowledge is not too superficial and my purpose not too narrow, a real insight into the _Logic_ will be given and a real insight into the labour movement too. But we must know the limits of what we are doing. We are getting an idea of the thing, that's all. However, when it comes to Identity and Difference and Contradiction, I think we should make some attempt to follow his abstract method, as we did to some degree in the Doctrine of Being. They are, as I say, the core.

The treatment of Identity in the smaller _Logic_ is one of the most baffling and most irritating things in Hegel. I suspect that a thorough knowledge of the old-fashioned logic would help. In any case Hegel seems to be saying something like this: “You see that tablecloth? It is more than a tablecloth; a thorough knowledge now of a tablecloth is absolutely necessary to understand logic; let us now go on to the next section.”

My explanation, as many of my explanations, undoubtedly will commit violations. But you will probably learn something from it. I have read numbers of brief explanations of Hegel and the _Logic_ in particular, which explained nothing. That is why I am using my own method. As the translators of the larger _Logic_ say quite frankly: “We have no doubt that we have failed to understand the thought in many places. “ I too know how easy it is to misinterpret. But that need not deter us. Now –

I look at something and in my view I get a picture of it (how I could tear _that_ formulation to pieces!) – book, stone, horse, house, labour movement, scientific theory, dish of ice-cream. I define it to myself: I establish its identity. I can be quite precise. I say: that house, I designed it. I built it. I live in it. I know all about it. I can describe it, maybe make an inventory. That house is that house. What I write on the paper, the plans, the photographs, the memories, etc., all correspond to that house. But the conception – that house, which I think I have established so clearly, eludes me even as I establish it. The house is changing. (I am changing too, but forget that, or rather put it aside for the moment.) In two years that house will be another house: paint gone, holes in the roof, furniture waterlogged, grass growing in the patio. Instead of that house being in Class A that house has degenerated into Class C. It happened in two years, but it was in reality happening all the time. The whole existence of the house is a struggle against precisely such a degeneration. Now Hegel says, and this is the first (broad) statement of _his_ particular Hegelian method, he says: I who know this, when I look at the house, l must say – this house is, but at the same time it is _not_, or to be more precise, it is and it is not what it is, it is also something else. You find it in the books as A is not equal to A. That formula is the most misleading formula that could be. Any fool can agree with it, and any fool can disagree. Simply because by itself it proves nothing. You have to take _the whole_ of the Hegelian argument or you had better leave it alone.

For Hegel, having established the uncertain character of Identity, moves on at once to Difference. And here he is equally bold but a little easier to follow. He says that if identity implies difference, then equally difference implies identity. I do not compare a camel to a French dictionary. Those are merely things which are unlike; there is no “difference” between them. Sure they are “different”, but that is a vulgar difference, as vulgar in its way as the identity that house is house. I can seriously compare the differences of two books, two novels, two novels of the same period, two novels of the same author. Difference, difference worth talking about, can only exist on the basis of some identity. And identity conversely can only exist on the basis of difference, this house is and is not that house. And this house today is not this house tomorrow or in two years' time.

In fact Hegel says at the moment you think, whether you know it or not, you negate the existent. “This house is worth $5,000” means it was worth more and that tomorrow it will be worth only $4000, or if the inflation goes on, $10,000, Negroes and all. If I am saying that this house is worth $5,000, was always worth $5,000 and will always be worth $5,000, for ever and ever, 1 am saying nothing, at least I am not seriously thinking. Thought has significance only when the house has relation to other houses which do not possess this priceless attribute of constantly maintaining the price.

Identity means difference. Difference means identity. And now with a leap we can get into it. Hegel says that this principle becomes important, in fact decisive, when you watch, make a philosophical cognition, about a single object. Within the identity of an object, you have to _establish the specific difference_, and within its specific difference, you have to establish the identity. If you have established the specific difference, the difference which belongs to _the_ object, which distinguishes it from all other objects and _their_ differences, then you have _the Other of the object_. The other is the difference that matters, the essential difference. But as it is special (essential) difference to no other object, then Other is therefore identical with _its_ object. To find _that_ out is to find out what makes the object move. l look at bourgeois society and I see capital, but labour is its other. In capital is essential difference, but both capital and labour are one identity.

I think myself that all this is thrilling. Let us now take this principle a little further, letting Hegel himself do most of the talking, if even I do not always use quotes. He says that this question of essential difference within every identity is the indispensable necessity for philosophic cognition. Later he will tell us when you say father, you have in mind son. Son is interpenetrated with father. Father has no meaning except in relation to son. Above has no meaning except in relation to below. If I did _not_ mean father in relation to son I would not say father, I would say: man or baseball-player or something, but then I am looking at another object or objects. So that simple, abstract identity is a fiction, a deadly trap for _thinkers_.

[It is of the greatest importance to recognise this quality of the Determinations of Reflection which have been considered here, that their truth consists only in their relation to each other, and therefore in the fact that each contains the other in its own concept. This must be understood and remembered, for without this understanding not a step can really be taken in philosophy.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_438)

_That_ is how house is not merely house. House is essentially a protection against Nature. So that identical with house is its Other, destruction by Nature. House can be a fort containing soldiers. So identical with house in that connection is its destruction by artillery, etc. House can be also a source of income. So that identical with it is decline in rent. Everything has its own specific complex of relations, and the something has different complexes of relations which continue to give it a specific Other, in other words, control its movement. That is a very important aspect of dialectic. And as Hegel loves to say, dialectic is not practised only by philosophers. The real-estate merchant, the architect, all these people know the particular Other of _their_ house very well. It is always in their concept. True the dialectic of the house is as a rule on a very low level, except in case of Florida hurricanes, fire, or runaway inflation. But that Hegel knows too. And he knows too that where you examine great social and intellectual forms in society, then you have got to remember that every object contains its Other in its own concept and every determination of thought has its other in its concept too. Labour always has capital in its concept. That is why labour in 1864 had the capital of 1864 in its concept, labour in 1948 has the capital of 1948 in its concept. Menshevism had Leninism in its concept, and Leninism had Stalinism in its concept. How Stalinism? Because as long as the new organism, socialism, had not been achieved, the revolutionary determination, Leninism, would be attacked by the reflection within it of the fundamental enemy of the proletariat, capital, and state capital within the labour movement is precisely Stalinism, as Menshevism was monopoly capital (in its stage of super-profits from imperialism) within the labour movement. You don't _know_ this? You cannot move a foot. It is worse. You can move but in the wrong direction.

Their truth consists only in their relation to each other. Each contains the other in its own concept. _Know_ this. Read it in the two _Logics_. Reflect on it. For if you don't, you cannot _think_. Their truth consists only in their relation to each other. The truth of the labour movement consists only in its relation to capital. How we have sweated to show that the truth of the First International can only be grasped in relation to the specific capital of the day, that the Second International had a similar relation, that the truth of the Third International, in relation to the Fourth International, must be the same. Understand it and _remember_ it. Remember it. Remember that Menshevism as a political tendency in the labour movement had its precise opposite, Leninism. That is the history of the Second International, of the Second International and no other. When Menshevism reached its peak it perished and Leninism took its place. That is the way it went, and it could _move_ no other way. The Labour movement could move from the revolutionary ideas of 1889 to 1917 only by way of an opposition, a transition through the growth of Menshevism, and by overcoming it. (We know but we have to repeat that these represented objective forces. But for the time being, let us concentrate on the process of thought.) I don't know if you have it. A determination of reflection is identity and difference. And the difference, the Other, emerges, becomes strong, and the Identity has to overcome it, for identity is the beginning of Essence, the movement forward.

The history of the Third International is the history of the supersession of Leninism by Stalinism. Hold the movement tight. You see what was show is now more than show. It is Other which forms the heartbreaking mountain that Identity has to create and climb before it can reach the height to re-establish itself as Identity once more on a higher plane. Thus the reflections of determination must be viewed. Do not give them a free, independent life of their own. They will murder you. Look into them. See their Other, and see if when something serious appears it is not Other which is coming out. Then you know it, you can trace it, you know why it is there, and you can mobilise forces to overcome it. But if you do not see it as Difference in identity, cruel, murderous, but (given the objective forces) necessary _transition_, then you rush off into fantastic explanations such as “tools of the Kremlin” or the incapacity of the workers to understand politics and such like. Once more. That which ultimately becomes the obstacle over which you must climb is an Other which was inside it, identical with it and yet essential difference.

If the Fourth International is to supersede Stalinism then it must “contain” Stalinism in its concept of itself. It begins from all the things that Stalinism took over from Leninism and kept (objective forces bring out Other – different objective forces would bring out a different Other). The moment you think, or allow it to lurk in your mind that the workers are backward or deceived, you repudiate two or three decades of history and your concept contains as its opposite, Menshevism. You then fight a ghost. The British workers, the American workers are not Menshevik, neither are the workers in Norway and Sweden. A poll taken a few months ago in all the European countries showed that over sixty per cent of the populations were ready to abolish customs duties, integrate economies, etc. What was vanguardism in Lenin's day is now an essential part of the whole populations. The Other of Menshevism was Leninism. The Other of Stalinism is an international socialist economic order, embracing from the start whole continents. Their truth consists only in relation to each other. Each contains the other in its own concept. It goes forward by overcoming this specific opposite. We have not laboured in vain. We have now (I hope) grasped without knowing what Hegel means by his great principle of contradiction.

## Contradiction

The most important pages in the Doctrine of Essence I have found to be Observation 3 of the larger _Logic_. I think when we have finished with this the hump will be behind us, though much will remain to be done.

Hegel in his tantalising way begins by talking calmly about Identity, Variety and Opposition, which he calls the primary determinations of Reflection. I preferred to talk about Identity Difference and Contradiction. Go look them up yourself if you want to. Then he says that contradiction is the root of all movement and life and only through it anything moves and has impulse and activity. Everybody, every Marxist, knows those statements.

Then Hegel does something very characteristic. He says that in regard to the assertion of some people that contradiction does not exist, “we may disregard this statement”. Just leave it. First of all he is, blessed man, not a politician. In politics you cannot disregard opponents. Secondly he cannot _begin_ by proving such a statement. To ask him to do this is, he considers, unscientific. The proof is all that he will say and the conclusions that he will reach. If you don't like it go your way. Then after a lot of the same panegyric to contradiction, he ends:

[Speculative thought consists only in this, that thought holds fast Contradiction, and, in Contradiction, itself, and not in that it allows itself to be dominated by it – as happens to imagination – or suffers its determinations to be resolved into other, or into Nothing .](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_441)

You have not got “quite _simple_ insight” into what this means, I am quite sure when you do you understand dialectic. Until you have that simple insight you do not understand it. To get that simple insight is going to be a job. Let us get down to it.

You remember that each contains the other in its own concept. I talked about organisation and spontaneity, party and mass, politics and economics. To say that each of these concepts must contain the other is to make a profound but general statement. Much work has been done in Bolshevism to show that politics contains economics in its concept. _No work_, absolutely none, has been done on the others, except for some marvellous beginnings by Lenin. (The subjects of organisation and spontaneity, party and mass, were not _urgent_ in Marx's day.)

As I said: to say that the truth of party consists in its relation with mass, the truth of organisation consists in its relation to spontaneity, is to say an abstract truth, but still important truth, a beginning. The one concept has life and movement _because of the opposition of the other_. It _moves_ because of the other, because the _other_ moves. It cannot move otherwise. And thought must know this and _hold it_. Look at Hegel's actual procedure in the _Logic_.

We begin with Identity. That became difference. He has now carried it to contradiction. _Each is carried to its limit and so becomes a point of transition for its opposite_. That is how quality becomes quantity. That is how quantity became measure.

That, then, is what Hegel is getting at by his treatment of identity, Difference, Contradiction, Variety, Opposition and his statement that contradiction is the source of all movement. When you observe what is an apparent identity, know that within it the contradictions exist, the essential differences. How will you know? In that annoying section in the smaller _Logic_ dealing with Identity he uses a superb phrase, “Identity is the ideality of Being”. The difference is first in your head, the Idea. (I asked you, remember, not to forget this, but to put it aside.) What happens in your head when you look at something can never be a simple reflection, an ordinary identity with it. You know where it is going, what it is aiming at. It has its being, the being is concrete, but its essence is that, because of its Other, it will move in a certain direction and your Idea tells you how to search for the Contradiction. Without that you cannot think. Look at what passes in the Marxist movement today as analysis of organisation.

Trotsky, we repeat, having failed for years to understand Lenin on “organisation”, in 1917 was converted; and this is what is true, forthwith converted it into a fetish, i.e. a persistent Understanding. For that is what fetishism is. (The Stalinists did the same.) Lenin's “principles of organisation” are today on all lips. They have become a complete abstraction, Understanding. That you can think of organisation only in relation to its opposite, spontaneity, this nobody, _not a single soul_, ever says a word about. I shall take this up concretely before long, but for the time being let us listen to Hegel and understand _him_.

He tells us first the way Imagination thinks and by Imagination (we had it a few minutes ago) Hegel means the kind of thought that deals only with what is familiar. Note what he calls it – Imagination. At first sight it seems incongruous. But I think he wants to contrast it with scientific method, analysis. In any case:

[Thus although imagination everywhere has Contradiction for content, it never becomes aware of it, it remains an external reflection, which passes from Likeness to Unlikeness . . . It keeps these two determinations external to each other, and has in mind only these, not their transition, which is the essential matter and contains the Contradiction.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_441b)

_Note their transition_. _That_ is the essential matter. The transition _shows_ the contradiction. Remember the growth of Bernsteinism within the revolutionary Second International in contradiction to the whole essential aim and purpose of the organisation; and after this growth the break of 1914-21, the point of the transition, when the revolutionary proletariat overcomes this and reasserts its essential purpose on a higher plane.

You nod your head and say: yes, yes, OK. I have it, I have it. Baloney. You will be a little more chastened, you will be much more chastened later, but you will be a little chastened now when you reflect that Lenin never saw this, _until after_, and Trotsky it can truly be said never saw it – up to 1923 at least he was singing the same old tune. So a little modesty please while we go on.

Imagination, in so far as it is revolutionary, sees Stalinism here, and “democratic socialism” over there; and never sees them, their identity or their unity as opposites. It does not see that the labour movement, being what it is in essence, the bureaucratic, criminal, organisational domination of Stalinism, will form inevitably _the_ point of transition for another stage higher. It sees the degrading organisation and in despair (or hope) scans the horizon looking for salvation. The Hegelian dialectic keeps its eyes glued on the Stalinist organisation for it knows that the Other of it is there. Now see Hegel's chief enemy Understanding make its bow:

[On the other hand intelligent reflection, if we may mention this here, consists in the understanding and enunciating of Contradiction. It does not express the concept of things and their relations and has only determinations of imagination for material and content; but still it relates them, and the relation contains their contradiction, allowing their concept to show through the contradiction.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_441c)

Understanding is the same as intelligent reflection. Understanding cannot, does not express the concept of things and their relations. Its determinations are what is familiar to it, not what is familiar in general but what is familiar to it, what once it worked out. It operates with bureaucracies which are unalterably tied to private property, and reformist internationals which always in crisis defend private property and the national state, _things familiar to it_. But Understanding relates these determinations – it thinks, it has perspectives. It says, “this is what it is, and this is what it ought to be.” You are able to glimpse the genuine concept. It shows through the contradiction. It is possible to have a more just, a more precise appraisal of the nature of Trotsky's writings? And now to see what they _are_, by seeing still more clearly what they are _not_. Let us see how the true Dialectic, Thinking Reason, handles these things. This is a clause by clause section. I hope you get it the first time. We worked hard enough.

[Thinking Reason, on the other hand, sharpens (so to speak) the blunt difference of Variety, the mere manifold of imagination, into essential difference, that is, Opposition.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_442)

Magnificent. MAG-nificent. Imagination sees a lot of various things, and sees them as Like and Unlike, a manifold variety. Reflection, Understanding, relates them and shows how they contradict each other. See how Stalinism contradicts a true revolutionary organisation. But Reason, Reason, catches hold of the variety and seeks out the Opposition, the Contradiction, _and drives them together_, ties them together, makes one _the_ Other of the other. Then things happen.

[The manifold entities acquire activity and liveliness in relation to one another only when driven on the sharp point of Contradiction.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_442a)

That is it. When they are both jammed together, locked together, each in the other, _that_ is the guarantee of their movement. When you concentrate all attention on the contradiction between Stalinist bureaucratism and the necessity of the proletariat for free creative activity, then all the phenomena begin to _move_. They do this only when the contradiction is at its sharpest. Hegel means that we can see the movement, only when we have clarified the contradiction – “thence they draw negativity” .

Quite so. The negativity of the free creative activity of the proletariat can only come completely into play when it is in contradiction with a concrete obstacle, something which, to release its own nature, it must overcome. It is the unbearable nature of the contradiction that creates negativity, “which is the inherent pulsation of self-movement and liveliness”.

Thus it is not a blemish, a fault, a deficiency in a thing if a Contradiction is to be found in it. That is its life.

[On the contrary, every determination, every concrete, every concept is essentially a union of distinguished and distinguishable moments, which pass over through determinate and essential difference into contradictory moments.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_442b)

I wonder if you have got the extreme, the unparalleled boldness of that statement. I can well imagine so many of the people we know saying, “Hegel, there is something in what you say. But as _usual_ you _exaggerate_.” _Every_ determination. _Every_ concrete. _Every_ concept. That is his way of saying everything has these moments, these oppositions; one of them is the opposite of what is the real, the essential nature of the organism. By its struggle against this the organism finds more of its real, its genuine nature. Writers on American political economy, writers on American history, students of Greek drama, writers on the development of unions, all of you, get this into your bones. It is not simple. Strive to see it, to see it “simply”, as Hegel said in the Introduction. If there is no sharp contradiction, then there is no movement to speak of and there is stagnation, a compromise. That is the only reason why there is compromise and stagnation – because the contradiction is not sharp enough.

The paragraph isn't concluded yet, but I propose to stay here for a while. First of all, listen to Hegel again, in the smaller _Logic_. Just as he approaches the climax of his work, his exposition of the Absolute Idea.

[In the course of its process the Idea creates that illusion, by setting an antithesis to confront it; and its action consists in getting rid of the illusion which it has created. Only out of this error does the truth arise. In this fact lies the reconciliation with error and with finitude. Error or other-being, when superseded, is still a necessary dynamic element of truth: for truth can only be where it makes itself its own result.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slobject.htm#SL212n1)

If you had to write this, you would know the bowed admiration with which I read phrases like “necessary dynamic element of truth” to describe error; and the majesty, the completeness of the phrase “truth can only be where it makes itself its own result”. The proletariat itself will smash Stalinism to pieces. This experience will teach it its final lesson, that the future lies in itself, and not in anything which claims to represent it or direct it.

This is the thing that people glibly write as thesis, antithesis and synthesis. Who ever understood that? Maybe a lot of other people understood it well and I was just dumb. But it took me a long, long time to see it, to get it in my bones, to get “simple insight” into it everywhere, in everything. What am I saying? The thing constantly evades me, but I chase it. A few things of great importance can be said at once, one general, and one particular.

By this doctrine, Hegel gets rid of that tendency to ignore reality or to be overwhelmed by it, which is always lurking around to hold our movement by the throat. He had the utmost contempt for people who tried to brush away the harsh, the cruel, the bitter concrete, the _apparently_ unadulterated evil. This is the way, and the only way that truth and the good come. Thus he could say that the real was rational. However evil reality might be, it had its place, its function in the scheme of development.

The great idealist, the man of World-Spirit, etc., did _not_ depend on World-Spirit concretely to teach people anything. Therefore he was the last man to expect people to be inspired, to see the light, to “recognise” that “we” were right all the time, or worst of all to be “educated” by a few gifted people. In fact he believed that Spirit, conscious knowledge, was only the province of a few philosophers. As far as great masses or classes of people learnt anything, they learnt it concretely in struggle against some concrete thing. Hegel's doctrine was reactionary but _that_ isn't what concerns us here. What does concern us is this. He would have laughed to scorn the idea that any party would _teach_ the masses free creative activity. He would have said instead: they will find themselves inevitably up against such a system of oppression, bureaucracy, manipulation and corruption within their own arena, their own existence, that they will have to overcome it to live, and free creative activity can only come into existence when it is faced with something that only free activity and free activity alone can overcome. That is the point of transition to a higher stage of existence. There is no other. The Stalinist bureaucracies thus become a stage of development. Free creative activity becomes immeasurably more concrete in our heads. Our notion of socialism changes and we see the harsh reality differently.

And finally, note that the _Logic_ itself moves by just this method of opposition, transition, timeliness. His analysis of identity, variety, opposition, ground, actuality, etc., particularly in the Doctrine of Essence, always represents, as he tells us, pairs of correlatives. One of them becomes overwhelming, it threatens to disrupt the whole process, the other overcomes it, and we find ourselves further on. That is how identity splits into difference; difference appears just as variety, but variety, variety, variety all over the place makes no sense; the manifold variety either disintegrates into craziness (and this happens; it means only that the object as such comes to an end) or this manifold variety crystallises into opposition. And so on. I think we got some place. Back now to the rest of the page. I attach great methodological importance to this page. Among other reasons I have it on my conscience for the way I am jumping from place to place and the still bigger jumps I am going to make. (Hegel would not be too angry. He would say: This impertinence of James, this undoubted evil is a necessary point of transition to some people so that they will read the whole book.) The thirty pages of Ground which I shall probably skip are on my conscience. But this page happens to say a great deal which will cover Ground (I hope). So here goes. I think I shall write freely and then quote lengthily.

Every concept there has these opposing movements. One becomes objectionable, evil, and this forms the bridge, the transition, for the real nature of the concept, to show itself. But when this overcoming does take place, what happens? The new thing is a resolved contradiction. It is, isn't it? Bernsteinism has been overcome. That contradiction is resolved. But inasmuch as the complete nature of the organism has not been revealed, i.e. socialism has not been achieved as yet, Leninism contains a new contradiction. Now this thing (forgive me, philosophical friends – for Christ's sake, I need no forgiveness, I have just seen that Hegel himself calls it “thing”) . . . now this _thing_ that is always producing contradictions, resolving them, and then finding new contradictions, this is _the subject or the concept_. It is not yet the complete, the concrete Absolute, i.e. the proletariat, self-conscious, self-acting, beginning the real history of humanity. The Russian workers were not that in 1917. It is therefore finite, as yet limited. Therefore contradictory. It still has negation before it. The finite, limited multiplicity, the manifold of which it consists, has a certain identity, a unity. But it constitutes a variety, and this variety can be seen to form itself into an opposition; we have a contradiction. But at any rate it is unified once more ready for the business of further splitting up and further negation. (You remember the last extract from the _Phenomenology_?) These stages of unification of resolved contradiction when Essence prepares for negation show us what is the real nature of the thing – its Ground. The fact that it keeps on finding higher and richer Grounds, that is its Essence. Whenever it sets up a good strong _concrete_ stage of resolved contradiction we can see what is its Ground.

[On the contrary, every determination, every concrete, every concept is essentially a union of distinguished and distinguishable moments, which pass over through determinate and essential difference into contradictory moments.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_442b)

[It is true that this contradictory concretion resolves itself into nothing – it passes back into its negative unity. Now the thing, the subject, or the concept is itself just this negative unity: it is contradictory in itself, but also it is resolved Contradiction; it is the Ground which contains and supports its determinations. The thing, subject, or concept, as intro-refracted in its sphere, is its resolved Contradiction; but its whole sphere again is determinate and various; it is therefore finite, and this means contradictory. Itself it is not the resolution of this higher Contradiction; but it has a higher sphere for its negative unity or Ground. Accordingly, finite things in the indifferent multiplicity are simply this fact, that, contradictory in themselves, they are intro-refracted and pass back into their Ground.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_443)

Here comes now a superb piece of analysis, the maestro at his best. I shall again refrain from clause-by-clause analysis, difficult as it is. I shall interpret freely and you will have the passage. Matthew Arnold in a famous piece of criticism says that you should know certain passages in poetry by heart and let them act as a test and touchstone of other poetry. The method has its dangers, but on the whole it is good. With the _Logic_ it is even more so. You must have some passages that you will read and re-read. They are more than a test. They are a handrail. With the more intricate passages, being busy with other things, I forget what I know. I patiently have to re-educate myself. These long quotations, in a context, with examples of familiar material serve this purpose too. You begin to understand and to use the _Logic_ when you read these and begin to dig with them into material of your own.

## Ground: the Proof of the Absolute

We have been (continues Hegel) inferring the necessity of an essential, continuous, infinite movement from watching and analysing a fixed, limited series of determinations. We shall have to examine this procedure later. But we must remember that we do not make this inference because the being, the determination, persists, becomes a Ground, breaks up, becomes another Ground, being much the same all the time. Not at all. It is because the limited, finite, determination constantly collapses and transcends itself that we can infer continuous motion.

Let us stop here a minute. It is not one International that tries a certain form, and when this fails, tries another form, and when this fails, tries another form (not the same people of course, but the same organisation). No. We could not draw any conclusions from that. The First International is one entity. It collapses. A new one is formed, and this shows us the Ground of these formations. It has the same aim and purpose as the first, though now enriched, developed, concretised. That collapses. A new one is formed. Thus whatever form it may accidentally take (contingency) we can see that it posits something fundamental to it, i.e. shows that this something will appear in the course of negation of the finite.

In ordinary thinking the Form, the constantly appearing Internationals, seem to be the Ground of our idea of a fully developed, concrete, international socialism some day. The Absolute Idea exists because the finite concretions keep appearing. No, says Hegel (and he is right as I shall demonstrate in a moment). The Absolute conception exists precisely because the finite Internationals are always collapsing. The first commonsense thinking says: the continued appearance of Internationals shows that there is an Absolute. The Hegelian dialectic says: the fact that all these Internationals lack so much, struggle and collapse, this is the proof of the existence of an absolute. We do not _add_ the different ones and come to a conclusion. No. As we watch them striving, failing but always incorporating, we recognise that they are expressing a movement to something prior to their contingent appearance.

I have a suspicion that I have vulgarised this somewhat: you will read for yourself. Hegel is dealing here with a strictly philosophical problem and what I have written is horatory. I don't mind really because he is going to come back to this and by the time he is finished with it, all our opponents will shrink from argument. I feel confident that the truth of the philosophical problem posed is contained in my vulgarisation, and that Hegel has this at the back of his head. You cannot prove inevitability or certainty _merely_ from repetition of the concrete.

You cannot _prove_ inevitability or certainty from a constant series of empirical facts, however often repeated. That the sun has risen every day for a million years is no _proof_ that it will rise tomorrow. For absolute certainty you must have a philosophical conception, which has _its own_ unshakeable basis. Hegel sought logical tightness in the World-Spirit. Marx found it in his philosophical concept of the nature of man-activity. I take Hegel to be saying here that Essence is a movement and we can be sure it is seeking an Absolute because every form is finite, seeking something further. But if your proof of the Absolute is the merely finite appearance, then every limitation, every collapse that is not an immediate and obvious resolution of contradiction into Ground is a terrible blow. But to jump a little, if you have Absolute in your head, for this is what it amounts to, then the

finitude, limitations, etc., become stages of advance, and above all advance in thought. It is obvious that involved here is the inevitability of socialism. We have seen this weakness which Hegel is warning against in the last few years so near home and in such high places that we can spend a little more time on this.

Hegel knew that you had to have a certainty that did not depend upon limited fixed determinations and categories. It had to depend on something else, and this, in the last analysis, is what drove him to World-Spirit. Elsewhere '¡ we have treated the inevitability of socialism as a necessity of logical thinking in dialectical terms. But it is wise to recall here that this necessity of having some ultimate goal between your present stage as the twin poles between which your thoughts must move, this also is the product of experience. Philosophers and great men of action have always thought in that manner. Few things are more amusing that the passage from Corinthians, I.15, which is read at Episcopalian burial services. St Paul's “inevitability of socialism” was that the dead rise again. It seems that some tired radicals in Corinth had sneered at the comrades there, asking them: You believe in the resurrection of the dead? How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come? Paul unloosed all his forces and it is a tour de force of gorgeous rhetoric, sophistry and passionate conviction. He said point-blank: Let _this_ go and everything else goes.

The Puritans were the same. _It was ordained_, they said. Same with the philosophers of the eighteenth century. Just get rid of the reaction and the reason inherent in all things will take over. It is the merit, not the weakness of Hegel, that he saw the necessity of giving this a solid logical foundation. The empiricists call it teleology, religion and all sorts of abusive names. I have dealt with them in _Dialectical Materialism and the Fate of Humanity_, and shown the contradictions in which they find themselves.

Here is the final extract.

[The nature of the true inference of an absolutely necessary Essence from a finite and contingent entity will be considered below. Such an essence is not inferred from the finite and contingent entity as from a Being which both is and remains Ground, but, as is also implied immediately in contingency, this absolute necessity is inferred from a merely collapsing and self-contradicting Being- or rather it is demonstrated that contingent Being passes automatically back into its Ground, where it transcends itself – and, further, in this retrogression it posits Ground in such a manner only that it makes itself into the posited element. In an ordinary inference the Being of the finite appears as the Ground of the absolute: the absolute is because the finite _is_. The truth, however, is that the absolute is just because the finite is self-contradictory opposition – just because it is _not_. In the former meaning an inference runs thus: The Being of the finite is the Being of the absolute; – but in the latter: The Not-being of the finite is the Being of the absolute.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_443a)

I hope you get it. I think it is a beautiful example of Hegel's method. This is all we can do: give some idea of what Ground is and why it is necessary. Essence is a movement. It is the analysis of Ground which tells us exactly what that movement is: Our abstract little spirit who didn't know what he was by his futile becomings was by degrees establishing some Ground. If you want more Ground, there it is.

### Review and Leninist Interlude

#### ESSENCE IS A MOVEMENT OF NEGATION

I feel guilty as hell. We are now only at p. 80 of Essence. I pass by Ground looking firmly at the other side. Substance, Necessity, Reciprocity, all of them I am going to pass by. I shall make some strictly ad hoc notes on Appearance and Actuality, and then over to Notion. But let us review a little and then look for some help. We are dealing with thought. We learnt to look at the quality of a thing and its dialectical movement into something else. We then saw that when we looked at it, what we saw was not a photograph, an identity. No, we saw difference within identity and identity within difference. We saw too that in our heads was an Idea which enabled us to distinguish the specific differences. We saw the importance of Contradiction, the fundamental relation of good and evil, truth and error, the process of transition. The object does not move into something else; it shows the Other contained in it. We are learning how to examine an object and how to examine thoughts about an object. Is Ground the _next_ transition after Contradiction? Does Appearance arise inevitably out of Existence? I doubt if Hegel would maintain all that in detail. These determinations in Essence are, it must be remembered, Determinations of Reflection. They are creations of thought, but creations which reflect the object, enable us to take it apart and put it together again, and first of all in our heads. We are going to the concept of Notion – the notion of the thing. We worry it as a dog worries a bone. That is what Essence teaches.

But before we take up the concepts of Appearance and Actuality we would do well to see what a remarkable intelligence, trained in the same sphere as we have been trained, made of the _Logic_, and examine his thinking with this in view. We need a little rest. Essence is the hardest part of the _Logic_, says Hegel, and we still have a long way to go.

Lenin in 1914 found himself in Zurich, with the world that he had known and his categories breaking to pieces. He did not get excited and start to make the revolution by himself. He had a _policy_ and he fought for it, but he recognised that everything was in a melting pot. He wrote above all _Imperialism_ and _State and Revolution_. He studied the _Phenomenology of Mind_, and he worked at Hegelian _Logic_. He made notes on the _Logic_. We have extracts and comments. Sidney Hook once told me that there wasn't much to them. Quite right. For _him_, there wasn't much. The Marxist movement swears by. . . Plekhanov. I remember on my journeys between Missouri and New York stopping at Washington and Rae, calling out an at-sight translation from Lenin's Russian notes and my scribbling them down. I still have the notebook. That they are not published means one thing – contempt for the masses. Yes, precisely. _They_ don't need it, _they_ are not up to it. And _therefore_ the party does not need it. Only when you have respect for the masses do you have respect for the party. There is nothing in these notes for Hook the academician. There is plenty for us in seeing what struck the mind of the great revolutionary as he read, with the years of Russian Bolshevism stored up in his mind and the perspective of world revolution before him. There is space for only a few things. But they stand out.

In reading on Quality in the Doctrine of Being, Lenin writes in very large writing:

LEAP

LEAP

LEAP

LEAP

This obviously hit him hard. He wanted it stuck down in his head, to remember it, always. He makes a note on it as follows:

[At the basis of the concept of gradualness of emergence lies the idea that the emerging is already sensuously or really in existence, only on account of its smallness not yet perceptible and likewise with the concept of the gradualness of disappearance.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlbeing.htm#HL1_370a)

Let us look up the extract itself:

[The gradualness of arising is based upon the ideas that that which arises is already, sensibly or otherwise, actually there, and is imperceptible only on account of its smallness; and the gradualness of vanishing on the idea that Not-being or the Other which is assuming its place equally is there, only is not yet noticeable; there, not in the sense that the Other is contained in the Other which is there in itself, but that it is there as Determinate Being, only unnoticeable. This altogether cancels arising and passing away: or the In-itself, that inner somewhat in which something is before it attains Determinate Being, is transmuted into a smallness of external Determinate Being and the essential or conceptual distinction into a difference external and merely magnitudinal. The procedure which makes arising and passing away conceivable from the gradualness of change is boring in the manner peculiar to tautology; that which arises or passes away is prepared beforehand, and the change is turned into the mere changing of an external distinction; and now it is indeed a mere tautology. The difficulty for such Understanding which attempts to conceive consists in the qualitative transition of something into its Other in general and into its opposite; Understanding prefers to fancy identity and change to be of that indifferent and external kind which applies to the quantitative.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlbeing.htm#HL1_370a)

Understanding once more gets the blows. This is a passage of great importance and Lenin has summarised it perfectly with his LEAP LEAP LEAP LEAP. The new thing LEAPS out. You do not look and see it small and growing larger. It is there, but it exists first in thought. Thought knows it is the object. You haven't to see it (though if you know it is there you can see signs and point them out). Hegel is bored to tears at people who keep looking for external signs and “the mere magnitudinal” as proof. Lenin did not fasten on this for nothing. He said: “Turn the Imperialist War into Civil War.” How many sincere opponents of imperialism recoiled in horror. “Too rash, too crude, not now.” (Trotsky was among them). Lenin would not budge. The socialist movement against imperialism would establish itself on the concrete transition – the opposition to the monstrous evil of the war. He didn't have to wait to see anything. That was there. It would LEAP up.

I was particularly struck by this in Lenin. Hegel is very irritating. He sticks to _method_. He does not shout. But every single one of his transitions involves a leap. He talks very quietly about impulse, etc. But you can go on reading for a long time and not get the true significance of the leap. I did not emphasise it. He held on to it.

On the Doctrine of Essence, Lenin fastens on to _precisely the same thing_. Look at this remarkable note on Observation 3.

[Movement and “self-movement” (NB this. An independent spontaneous, _internally necessary_ movement), “alteration”, “movement and life”, “principle of every self-movement”, “impulse”, (drive) to “movement” and to “activity” – opposite of “dead being” – who would believe that this is the core of “Hegelianism”, of abstract and abstruse (difficult, absurd?) Hegelianism. We must uncover this core, grasp it, “save” unveil, purify it – which Marx and Engels have also accomplished.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm#LCW38_141)

That is something _vital_. Self-movement. Spontaneous activity. We shall meet them again. You wait. This is what we must hold on to, grasp, “unveil, purify”. We can say that we have done some. This movement, activity, spontaneous, internally necessary. The man of organisation knew what moved the world, especially the social world. Hegel could write about thoughts for decades, but this was the drive, and it made LEAPS (four of them at once).

On Observation 3 see notes among other things:

[NB 1. The usual perception comprehends the difference and the contradiction but not the transition from one to the other, which however, is the most important.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm#LCW38_143)

We shall come back to Lenin again. But let us sit and write in large print on our notes: LEAP, SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY, SELF-MOVEMENT, etc. etc. Where he wrote it four times, we should write it forty-four. The past point from Lenin is important not only in itself but for us, _in this study_. And it comes right in here.

These last notes of Lenin that we must take up will be rather lengthy. That is because they have tremendous value for us, (a) in themselves as a review of the past, (b) as teaching the interconnectedness of the various parts of the _Logic_ and the underlying unity of the method at all stages, (c) illuminate the closing parts of the Doctrine of Essence yet to come, (d) show us the Hegelian method of thought and action of Lenin: i.e. of a revolutionary} and (e) prepare us for the last historical stage of this essay: Lenin's own work, for which and from which alone we can jump off and fly for ourselves.

That is a mouthful but every bit of it is juicy. And I hope no one is impatient. Let us see where we are. We did the Doctrine of Essence up to Ground. We discussed the question of how you arrive at Inevitability, the Absolute. We _promised_ to take up only Appearance and Actuality as two further stages of the Notion. We then went into a Leninist interlude and review. We saw Lenin's emphasis on the LEAP (four times); and on constant movement, spontaneous internally necessary self-activity . We noted that the whole _Logic_ itself, the continuous transitions from this Ground to that Ground, to the other Ground to Complete Ground, was just this continuous self-generating, spontaneous activity, though the activity had a certain order which it was the business of thought to organise in accordance with the laws immanent in it, i.e. the laws of its own development. Good. We are now about to take up a note of Lenin's which opened up a formidable perspective of benefits, both for the past review and future developments. Who now is tired can take a rest, and after a nap, can start off afresh. Let's go.

The note itself is very slight. It arises from Section I of the larger _Logic_ on Quality. It says:

[The idea of the transformation of the ideal into the real is _profound_; very important for history. But also in the personal life of a man, it is evident that in this there is much truth. Against vulgar materialism. NB: The difference between idea and material is in any case, not unconditional, not extravagant.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch01.htm#LCW38_114)

That's all. I looked up the section and glanced through it again. It is some hundred pages long. It is in the Doctrine of Being, mind you, the _first_ section, in fact, the real _beginning_ of the _Logic_.

Hegel is grappling with words that he always has in mind, finite and infinite. What is the true infinity? “Finite” is a fixed, limited determination or category. The infinite is not simply something that is _beyond_ the finite. That he says is nothing, a bad infinite. (Get your thinking muscles in order. Sit up and take notice). The infinite is _not_ something in general that is beyond what we know as actual. It is the fact that what is beyond the finite comes back, and accomplishes a return to the finite and keeps on doing this, that makes it a true infinity. The beyond, the infinite, is not _abstract_ or _indeterminat_e Being, something we know nothing about, our old monster, Nothing. It, the infinite, the beyond, is self-related Being, because to come into existence at all the infinite is going to have to negate the finite. It is thus a negating force. And whatever negates is something present. If we may here use a _metaphor_: Infinite is the Other of the finite. But Infinite is _not_ negation in general. It is the bad infinite which negates the existing and puts nothing in its place. That is vague fancy, caprice, and nonsense (or mere reflection). Socialism is not a vague, rosy-coloured picture of infinite beauty and truth and love, something beyond our miserable life. Socialism, the beyond, is the concrete negation of what we have – Stalinism. The overcoming of Stalinism is the next stage of infinity – and for my part the working class today when it overcomes Stalinism, i.e. _the “capitalising” of the concept of the proletarian party_, that working class, having overcome this, is truly socialistic. For that matter when it overcomes its main enemy, capital, and the brutalities of fascism, inflation, imperialist war, the destructive, the class elements in modern industry, _that_ is socialism – the only infinite that there is. But why does the infinite for some people remain a Beyond, a far distant? And then comes a knock-out blow. That is in the last analysis, “based on the fact that the finite as such is held fast as existent.” That is the mentality which sees socialism in the far distance and is really chained to the idea that what the workers want is a higher standard of living, “a full dinner-pail”, “peace”, “security”, “full employment”. All he has done is to hold fast to the existent, making it tolerable by patching up the holes. That is the next stage of socialism. Shachtman is that _typ_e complete. The opposition, the socialism that lies in the struggle and overcoming of Stalinism is beyond him. But that does not exhaust the type. At the other end of _its_ scale is Trotsky. He holds fast to another type of existent, the world of 1917. After twenty-one years of the Russian revolution all he could say was: revive the soviets; revise the plan in the interests of the toilers; free the unions. If Shachtman is Imagination, which thinks only with what is familiar, Trotsky is Understanding, which thinks only with what is familiar to _it_. To both, the next stage is _excluded_. Yes, to _both_ of them. And precisely because of that, the present eludes them. Thus early, at the beginning, in Quality, in the Doctrine of Being, Hegel was saying, in general, on a very abstract level, what he will be saying on a more developed level in Essence, and on a still higher level in the Doctrine of the Notion.

Here then is the complete extract. The phrase “progress to infinity” is characteristic of those who do not see the real nature of infinity. They see infinity as a straight line. Hegel says it is a series of circles, each circle, however, including and yet excluding the previous circle, thus:

This infinite is the accomplished return upon itself. As such it is self-relation or Being; but not abstract or indeterminate Being, for it is posited as negating negation; and thus it is also Determinate Being, for it contains negation as such, and, therefore, determinateness. It exists, and exists as a Determinate Being, present and before us. It is only the bad infinite which is the beyond, because it is the negation, and nothing more, of the finite posited as real; it is thus abstract and first negation; it is determined as merely negative, and is without the affirmation implicit in Determinate Being; and if held fast as mere negative it is even supposed to be non-existent and beyond reach. But to be thus beyond reach is not its glory but its shame; which, ultimately, is based on the fact that the finite as such is held fast as existent. That which is untrue is beyond reach; and it is evident that such an infinite is the untrue. The image of the “progress to infinity” is the straight line, the infinite still remaining at its two limits and there only where the line is not; now the line is Determinate Being, which passes on to this its contradictory, that is, into the indeterminate. But as true infinity, turned back upon itself, it has for image the circle, the line which has reached itself, closed and wholly present and having neither beginning nor end.

Now having said this he proceeds to say the most astonishing things, for those who think in terms of common sense. He says, for example, that it is not the finite, the fixed limited, concrete, which is real. It is the Infinite which is real. And I trust no one reading this is so dumb as not to be aware that this is the very point we dug into on Ground where we discussed the Absolute in terms of the Being and Not-Being of the finite. Yet that is Volume II, page 70 about, and this is Volume I, page 162. There are some four hundred pages in between. Isn't this fellow marvellous? And far away in the centre of Volume II he will come back to it again, and end up once more with it in the final section, on methods of inquiry, or the Idea of Cognition. He himself practises the continually enlarging circles.

True infinity thus taken, in general, as Determinate Being opposed affirmatively to abstract negation, is Reality in a higher meaning than is that infinity which before was determined as simple; it has here received concrete content. It is not the finite which is the real, but the infinite; and thus Reality is further determined as Essence, Notion, Idea, and so forth. It is however, superfluous to repeat these earlier and more abstract categories, such as “Reality”, when the more concrete has been reached, and to employ them for determinations more concrete than these are in themselves. A repetition, such as is made when we say that Essence or the Idea is the Real, has its reason in the fact that, to uncultivated thought, the most abstract categories, such as Being, Determinate Being, Reality, and Finitude, are the most familiar.

I leave that to you, and hurry on to the last passage:

Here there is a more definite reason for recalling the category of reality, for the negation to which it stands in the relation of affirmative is here the negation of negation: it is thus itself opposed to this reality, which is finite Determinate Being. Negation is thus determined as ideality; that which partakes of the ideal nature is the finite as it is found in true infinity, as a determination or content, which though distinct does not exist independently, but only as moment. Ideality has this more concrete meaning, which is not fully expressed by negation of finite Determinate Being.

Yes. The real is only a moment, though fixed, limited, finite, in the Ideal. Don't ignore it. It is “distinct”. But it has no independent existence. Identity now has a more concrete meaning, and it is not sufficient to say that the Infinite, the beyond will negate the finite: socialism will do away with all this in general. No, sir. That only means that you have not done away with all this and cannot see the forces that are doing away with it. But there are some people who do not understand this. Hegel continues:

But with relation to reality and ideality the opposition to finite and infinite is taken in this manner, that the finite is taken as real and the infinite as of ideal nature; and such, indeed, and only such, the Notion is later on taken to be; whereas Determinate Being in general is taken as real.

You may try to change the phrasing to help them. You can't. They “remain fixed in the affirmative Determinate Being of the finite. “

That is the aim of the _Logic_, for the thousandth time: how to keep out of the fixed, limited, finite categories. Hegel is doing just this, in a constantly more concrete manner, page after page. That is all. But what an all! To get out of the clutching hands of fixed categories. It isn't easy. Precisely because we have to get them fixed and precise before we can do anything. We can remain fixed in them when they are grabbed on to by people who are objectively satisfied to remain there.

Worse still, we can remain fixed in them _when they no longer exist_. The result is complete frustration, and blindness to reality. Within those categories Trotskyism works. Stalinism, however, has found _the objective basis_ for those categories as fixed and static, finite and limited forms. (I have been searching for this for weeks and I have it). Stalinism has found the objective basis for the fixed categories of Leninism. Hence it operates on a material basis. The games it played with Trotsky over socialism in a single country were the concretisation, the stabilising of its ideology- For Stalinism, this was a real ideology. For Trotsky it was in essence a fiction without any reality.

Now we can go ahead and select a few sentences which contain the core of Hegel's Ideality.

The proposition that the finite is of ideal nature constitutes Idealism.

You see here the close connection between the ideal and the real. The real is constantly creating an ideal which tomorrow becomes the real and so on.

Hegel curses those people for whom the ideal is in their own heads and their own caprice. How he hates them.

By that which is “of ideal nature” the form of imagination is meant primarily; and this name is given to whatever is in my imagination in general, or in the concept, in the idea, in the fancy, and so forth; so that it comes to be counted equivalent only to fancies – imaginations which are not only distinct from the real, but are supposed in their essence to be not real.

Hegel has no use for that. The idea for him is in such close connection with the real that you cannot separate them. A genuine ideal today is the real of tomorrow. And that is the way life, and the logic, move.

So we go back to Lenin's modest but pregnant note about Hegel. The transformation of the ideal into the real is profound, very important for history. You remember in _Dialectical Materialism and the Fate of Humanity_ I quoted a section from an old article in the _New International_ showing how ideal became real, etc., owing to the aims and objective consolidations and compromises of classes and sections of classes. But this very thing will become in time for us the basis of long overdue theoretical investigation and then concrete practical politics. We have now (a) reviewed the past, (b) seen the interconnection and underlying unity of the parts of the _Logic_. We promised also to (c) illuminate the closing parts of Essence yet to come – the rest will have to wait. On now to the last parts of the Doctrine of Essence. (After terrible hours of labour, I am feeling pretty good. I think we have got some place, and are on the road to some better places).

### Appearance and Actuality

---

  

Now, having leapt over Ground, and taken a vacation with Lenin, we find ourselves in Appearance. I want to take up Appearance for a particular reason.

One of our most important pieces of work is the exposure of the analysis of the Stalinist parties as “tools of the Kremlin”. We say that it is true that they are “tools of the Kremlin”. But that, we say, is only the appearance of things. We say that in essence they are a product of labour and capital at this stage, as Menshevism was a product of labour and capital at that stage. We clinch it by saying: if there had been no Russian revolution, no Kremlin, but capitalism had continued to degenerate without being overthrown by socialism, then there would have appeared such a party as Stalinism, preaching revolution, ready to join up across national boundaries with other workers, repudiating private property and national defence, but mortally afraid of the workers and rushing for protection and refuge to a larger imperialism, bureaucratic, corrupt, monolithic, reflecting capitalism in its stage of state capitalism. Our opponents continue with these “tools of the Kremlin”. It is disgusting. Yet, curiously enough, they do not call the present Mensheviks “tools of Washington”. They have Lenin to go by and they at least try to relate these to labour and capital – falsely, but at least they try.

The importance of our analysis is obvious. It enables us to characterise Stalinism as a stage of transition – we are not in the ridiculous position of explaining why these “tools of the Kremlin” for no God-damn reason fasten themselves on the Kremlin. We place the responsibility on capitalism. We paint them objectively and not subjectively.

So much in general. In particular, we rid ourselves of the Russian hangover. “Socialism in a single country” originated from Russia and has never held the slightest interest for the world proletariat – never. I remember the days when we nourished ourselves on the illusion – I said it often – that when the workers _understood_ at last that the communist parties were merely agents of Stalin's foreign policy, they would turn to us. Everybody knows this truth now. They turn to the Stalinists more than ever. The whole method of thinking was wrong. Socialism in a single country did not “produce” communist parties that turned to their own bourgeoisie. That socialism could not be built was as great an abstraction as Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution. It was a continuation of his old struggle with Bolshevism, by this time corrupted under Stalin. All this, the theory of the permanent revolution, the whole debate about socialism in a single country, the masses would turn to us when they understood, etc., all this is the purest subjective thinking with no objective contact with reality. “Tools of the Kremlin” is Appearance, the specific labour organisation of the epoch of state capitalism is Essence. That is only in general. Let us arm ourselves with some dialectical logic.

Essence is a movement. This movement has to appear. Its immediate appearance Hegel calls Existence. Something exists, but it is transitory, unimportant, mere Show, until it persists and becomes Appearance. Appearance is existence which has become “essential”

[Essence accordingly is not something beyond or behind appearance, but just because it is the essence which exists – the existence is Appearance (Forth-shining).](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slappear.htm#SL131a)

But you have to be careful with appearance. You cannot dismiss it – this is _only_ a mere appearance. Hegel says:

[Appearance is in every way a very important grade of the logical idea. It may be said to be the distinction of philosophy from ordinary consciousness that it sees the merely phenomenal character of what the latter supposes to have a self-subsistent being. The significance of appearance, however, must be properly grasped, or mistakes will arise. To say that anything is a mere appearance may be misinterpreted to mean that, as compared with what is merely phenomenal, there is greater truth in the immediate, in that which is. Now in strict fact, the case is precisely the reverse. Appearance is higher than mere Being, a richer category because it holds in combination the two elements of reflection-into-self and reflection-into another: whereas Being (or immediacy) is still mere relationlessness, and apparently rests upon itself alone. Still, to say that anything is only an appearance suggests a real flaw, which consists in this, that Appearance is still divided against itself and without intrinsic stability. Beyond and above mere appearance comes in the first place Actuality, the third grade of Essence, of which we shall afterwards speak](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slappear.htm#SL131n_1).

[In the history of Modern Philosophy, Kant has the merit of first rehabilitating this distinction between the common and the philosophic modes of thought. He stopped halfway however, when he attached to Appearance a subjective meaning only, and put the abstract essence immovable outside it as the thing-in-itself beyond the reach of our cognition. For it is the very nature of the world of immediate objects to be appearance only. Knowing it to be so, we know at the same time the essence, which, far from staying behind or beyond the appearance, rather manifests its own essentiality by deposing the world to a mere appearance. One can hardly quarrel with the plain man who, in his desire for totality, cannot acquiesce in the doctrine of subjective idealism, that we are solely concerned with phenomena](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slappear.htm#SL131n_1).

A good passage. Worth working over. But its importance _for us_ is _both_ theoretical and practical. Theoretical because we have just been saying at some length that the real is only a moment of the ideal. Good. But that was in general. Now Hegel is saying that the whole world is Appearance but that Appearance is a manifestation of Essence. And when he warned us that the real was real “distinct”, he now warns us that appearance is no “mere” appearance. It if were, it would be a show (one of the cheap kinds of show, for Hegel, blast him, has many “shows”). The warning means: you must _relate_ appearance to Essence.

A salutary warning! “Tools of the Kremlin” is the only way in which Essence could appear in the contemporary world. It was not this appearance by chance. This is the truest value of Hegel. He makes you wrestle with the problems, probe into them, see deeper and more complicated relations (which, however, tend to a greater simplicity), and help you to re-examine the object. A true appearance is one that _must_ be that way. Doubtful? Let's see.

If a bureaucracy is convinced that capitalism as it has known it is hopeless and helpless, if it feels the pressure of the revolutionary masses, if it lives in mortal terror of the mass upheaval which seems to it to mean chaos and the destruction of civilisation, then with its own bourgeoisie offering no perspective, it must turn to another. It must turn to the revolutionary proletariat or to the bourgeoisie. In fundamental crisis there is no other place for it to go. It therefore turns to the opposite major imperialism. It creates an idealised version of its patron, it fastens upon what it thinks will make clear to its followers the necessity of supporting it. It becomes its advocate, it adopts its ideology; in its own defence it becomes defender of its patron.

The proof of this can be seen by observing those who _oppose_ the Russian regime. Stalinism has one phrase for _them_: “tools of American imperialism”. In all the satellite countries and in Russia no doubt the opposition which is not able to turn to the revolutionary masses but finds the Russian regime intolerable has fundamentally the same attitude to American “democracy” and “industrial power” that the opposition, the Stalinists in the Western world, have to Russian “planned economy”. Were it not for the merciless totalitarian regime, we should find in all probability the opposition leadership in Russia and certainly in the satellite countries, such as it may be, as bold, as fanatical, for “democracy” as the Stalinists are for “planned economy”.

”Planned economy” seems to be something new and is more in harmony with the present stage of capitalism, but the opposition is as fanatical as the Stalinists are, and given the opportunity of time, American money, and the freedom the Stalinists have in the democracies, the leaders would create an ideology and a practice which would enable their enemies to call them “tools of the White House” in the same way that the Stalinists are called “tools of the Kremlin”. They could do this very well without advocating the return to private property of heavy industry. It is precisely for this reason that Stalin allows nothing in, not a peep of even a foreign newspaper. _Opposition to the regime which is not revolutionary must seek the ideology of the opposing imperialism_. This is the logical movement. It is, however, as a logical movement always is, modified by all sorts of circumstances. An old, historically powerful country like Britain, with its own deeply-rooted traditions and a powerful and united working class, cannot preach “Americanism” as the Stalinists preach Stalinism. The labour bureaucracy, however, acts in subservience to American imperialism in all important matters. De Gaulle, that powerful trumpeter of French nationalism, has now become a genuine American admirer. But in weaker countries like Rumania, Hungary, etc., the opposition to Stalinism is without this combination. The socialists are for “American democracy”, and combine this with proposals for nationalisation .

So that appearance is no mere appearance. It is the only way in which in the present complex of conditions Essence can shine forth. And Hegel means precisely that. Otherwise Appearance is not Appearance. It is show or Existence or some damn thing. But when its quality grows and grows until it settles down into Appearance, then you have something. And as you learn to read the larger _Logic_ and his pages upon pages of apparently abstruse and mystifying jargon, you will find him forcing you to see movement, pattern, connection, order, inevitability where formerly you saw nothing or mere chance.

The implications of all this are enormous for thought in relation to the modern world. The idea that the Russian revolution attracted so many fades into the subjectivity that it is. This relation of Appearance and Essence teaches us to see that it is hopelessness in capitalism and hopelessness in the revolution which drove anti-capitalists to the Moscow bureaucracy. They found an objective basis and function and fought off their enemies. That is why the defeat in Germany in 1933 and the coincident degradation of the masses strengthened American imperialism. Each group boasted its own “nationalisation” or “democracy”, some combining both, but knowing where the emphasis lay. These were the traps laid for the masses. Trotsky's arguments on socialism in a single country not only led to false conclusions. It cut him off from any serious possibility of examining what was taking place in Western Europe.

It is impossible to stay here now and examine all the implications. Let us go on with Hegel. He says that after Appearance the next stage is Actuality, and he tells us what Actuality is. When Appearance is no longer the expression of Essence but assumes an independent existence of its own, and Essence too comes out in its own name and right, then we have Actuality. The veils are torn away, two totalities face each other. Hegel writes: There is no transition.

[In actuality this unity is explicitly put, and the two sides of the relation identified. Hence the actual is exempted from transition, and its externality is its energising. In that energising it is reflected into itself: its existence is only the manifestation of itself, not of another.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL142a)

There is now no internal transition, no reflection. Fundamental forces are in conflict _in the open_. In Actuality, essence, the movement to realisation, is seen plain. Appearance that was, the way Essence used to shine forth, is now something in its own right. In the organism we have been following, the proletariat, Actuality is as plain as day to a dialectician. The movement of the proletariat, its seeking after the realisation of its potentialities is plain, even Shachtman can see it. But the bureaucracies, the organisations, the parties, these no longer express the movement. They have now acquired an independent existence of their own within the totality. The conflict is at its most acute. There is no _transition_. There is due now the total reorganisation into something new. As Marcuse remarks in _Reason and Revolution_, the category of Actuality means merciless struggle.

I have to leave it to you to work out with Hegel how a stage like Actuality expresses itself in Substance, then in Causality where, contrary to Understanding which perpetually sees cause here and effect there, Hegel sees cause as measurable only by effect. This cause is _that_ effect. But that effect is another cause. Effect is incited into action by cause. But cause too is incited by effect. You cannot separate them. The opposing units are jammed too tight. From causality, the step is easy to action and reaction, what Hegel calls Reciprocity. It is a more intensive stage of Cause and Effect. Of Reciprocity Engels writes: “What Hegel calls reciprocal action is the organic body, which therefore forms the transition to consciousness, i.e. from necessity to freedom, to the idea: see _Logic_ II, Conclusion.''

And under the stress of this violent pressure back and forth, for neither can give way, the organism boils over into the Notion. It knows itself for what it is. That stage is not far off for the proletariat.

As you work through Substance, Possibility, Necessity, Contingency, etc., do not handicap yourself by trying to fit _every_ paragraph into some phase of the development of the proletariat to socialism. It is not necessary. Hegel examined all the available material of his own day, in all the major spheres of nature and society to abstract this essential blueprint. What we should do is to note what he says about Actuality and the Idea. He wants you to keep them as close as you kept Appearance and Essence. He warns against making any great separation between Actuality and Idea. They are close. We should remember that today. His comment is easy, colloquial, very different from that in the larger _Logic_. It nevertheless says what he wants to say. Note how the Idea hugs the Actuality – the ideal and the real (you remember our interlude with Lenin?) in the abstract generalities of Being have now become more concentrated in the more developed sphere of Essence.

[Actuality and thought (or Idea) are often absurdly opposed. How commonly we hear people saying that, though no objection can be urged against the truth and correctness of a certain thought, there is nothing of the kind to be seen in actuality, or it cannot be actually carried out ! People who use such language only prove that they have not properly apprehended the nature either of thought or of actuality. Thought in such a case is, on one hand, the synonym for a subjective conception, plan, intention or the like, just as actuality, on the other, is made synonymous with external and sensible existence. This is all very well in common life, where great laxity is allowed in the categories and the names given to them: and it may of course happen that e.g. the plan, or so-called idea, say of a certain method of taxation, is good and advisable in the abstract, but that nothing of the sort is found in so-called actuality, or could possibly be carried out under the given conditions](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL142n).

[But when the abstract understanding gets hold of these categories and exaggerates the distinction they imply into a hard and fast line of contrast, when it tells us that in this actual world we must knock ideas out of our heads, it is necessary energetically to protest against these doctrines, alike in the name of science and of sound reason. For on the one hand Ideas are not confined to our heads merely, nor is the Idea, upon the whole, so feeble as to leave the question of its actualisation or non-actualisation dependent on our will. The Idea is rather the absolutely active as well as actual. And on the other hand actuality is not so bad and irrational, as purblind or wrong-headed and muddle-brained would-be reformers imagine. So far is actuality, as distinguished from mere appearance, and primarily presenting a unity of inward and outward, from being in contrariety with reason, that it is rather thoroughly reasonable, and everything which is not reasonable must on that very ground cease to be held actual. The same view may be traced in the usages of educated speech, which declines to give the name of real poet or real statesman to a poet or statesman who can do nothing really meritorious or reasonable](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slactual.htm#SL142n).

Between us, it is very meritorious and reasonable when Hegel discusses these things in that way. The translators of the larger _Logic_ say that at times in that work he seemed to be obscure and mysterious in his language for sheer devilry. But here he is quiet and easy.

This for us is the end of Essence. We have seen it grow from Show, we dug into its Ground (we didn't dig too deep), we skipped over to Appearance. We saw in Actuality the different elements come out into the open. Henceforth no compromise is possible. War to the end. Another time, you will see the philosophical investigations and method which Hegel used to get this. You will tackle perhaps the fascinating problem of how this philosophical development took place, and how it compares to an intelligent man unphilosophically examining an object and learning more and more _experience_. You will see later how gifted individuals, expressing their own psychosomatic idiosyncrasies proved unable to go further than a certain stage in thought, and how classes, or sections of classes made them their spokesmen. All this is for the future. But now we have, in accordance with out practice, to use Essence, lift ourselves a stage, just one more stage further. I propose to do two things: (1) examine Lenin's work, for until we go through that and make it our own, we cannot go on; (2) after doing that step forward a little, in general, on our own, keeping well within Essence. When you read Cause and Effect in Essence, a very high stage of Essence, you will remember that in the _Logic_ Hegel had also expounded on Cause and Effect, in general, stage by stage, step by step. That I have learnt.

The Hegelian Logic

### The Doctrine of the Notion

---

  

The Doctrine of the Notion is _Subjective_ Logic, the logic of Mind, of thought itself. In the Doctrine of Being, we dealt with thought as it watched and felt the influence of simple determinate objects. In Essence we examined a more complex process, objects were “reflected” by thought into thought determinations representing parts of the object; transition from stage to stage. Now we go over into the Notion. The object is no longer plain and simple being. It is no longer divided into thought-determinations. It is a whole once more, but a whole enriched by our previous wrestling with it. And the object being now a whole, thoroughly examined, the examination moves over not to the logic of thought in relation to the object, but to the logic of thought itself, of the concept, _as a concept_.

[And so too the notion may, if it be wished, be styled abstract, if the name concrete is restricted to the concrete facts of sense or of immediate perception. For the notion is not palpable to the touch, and when we are engaged with it, hearing and seeing must quite fail us.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slsubjec.htm#SL160n1)

But Hegel insists, the notion is concrete, a “true concrete” for thought though it is, there has been incorporated into it all the wealth of being and essence “merged in the unity of thought”.

The previous doctrines had a triple movement. Thus the Doctrine of Being moved between Quality, Quantity and Measure. The Doctrine of Essence moves between Identity, Difference and Opposition (which passes back into Ground); there is a relation between Quality and Identity; between Quantity and Difference; between Measure and Opposition (or Ground).

In the Doctrine of Being the dialectical movement was confined to transition into _something else_. In the Doctrine of Essence the dialectical movement is confined to transition into something which belonged to the very thing we were examining – “the something else” is the something itself; but its Other, we dug it out. All these are connected together, opposition, higher stages, etc. I shall not do a damned thing about that. This is not a summary of exposition of the _Logic_. It is an introduction to the _Logic_, an illustration of how _we_ should use it, and a demonstration of its validity.

But we should be prepared now to look for a triple movement in the Notion. It is there, and these divisions are very old in the examinations of thought. They are Universal, Particular and Individual. Then Hegel is going to spend long pages on Judgment, on the syllogism: All men are mortal, Gaius is a man, therefore Gaius is mortal. He pursues them into all their different shapes and forms, but they are not abstract, formal, finite, fixed, limited. He shows how they developed out of one another, by contradiction, etc., using all the laws he has worked out in the _objective_ logic. Take the Judgment. When you say, “a house is good, according to its character”, you make one sort of judgment; when you say “the house, if of such and such a character, is good”, you have developed that judgment and so on. He has four main classes of Judgment, the Judgment of Inherence, the Judgment of Subsumption, the Judgment of Necessity, the Judgment of the Notion; but the Judgment of Inherence, for instance, is divided into the Positive Judgment, the Negative Judgment, the Infinite Judgment; and each of the others has its three divisions. I have not worked through the Judgments, but I know that the Judgment of Inherence corresponds to Quality in the Doctrine of Being and to Identity in the Doctrine of Essence; that the Judgment of Subsumption and Necessity correspond to Quantity in the Doctrine of Being and Difference in the Doctrine of Essence. The same with the syllogism and so on. Hegel says, in ordinary logic books they tell you, here are these forms: apply them or learn them or do something with them. _He_ says: they didn't just fall from the sky, they each came from somewhere, at a certain stage of development; they moved to higher and more complicated forms, they proceeded to these higher forms by a certain process. In _Dialectics of Nature_, Engels has what is in my modest opinion a very satisfying passage on the Judgment.

Now if you have been paying attention you will now know what the Doctrine of the Notion is about; it deals with this development of the standards of consciousness as such. You remember the Preface and the Introduction to the _Phenomenology_, the thing tested and the testing thing. Notion deals with the testing thing – the apparatus of thought. And despite all Hegel's raptures about how now we are in the blue sphere of the World-Spirit, etc., in the Subjective Logic he traces as logically objective a development as you could wish. But it is well to remember that we are in the realm of thought. Its destructive character is _development_, by which Hegel means that it shows only what is immanent in it, for example, the plant is developed from its germ. Nothing appears in the plant which is not contained in the germ. Identical twins show that very clearly. At fifty they often look exactly alike, which means that their germ contained all that they afterwards became. Hegel is saying that whereas in the Doctrine of Being the thing changes into something else, but something else which though “else” is really a part of it, it reflects an interior other; in the Dialectic of the Notion, the small thing, the abstract beginning, constantly expands and develops into broader and broader, more concrete, a more rich, more complicated, more all-embracing stages, which were in it from the very beginning. Thought, remember? Thought. Ideas as ideas.

With this very modest contradiction we can now begin. I shall interpret freely and then stick the passage down. Nowhere, not even in Marx, have I been so thrilled at the sheer logical divining and interpretative power of the human intellect. If you want to try it out yourself the passage is on p. 242 of the larger _Logic_ where he is taking up the Particular; he has already dealt with Universal. _We_ haven't to deal specially with Universal. We are familiar with it. State is a universal – it embraces every kind of political government. It is entirely concrete. It is entirely abstract. Such another is “the revolution”. Another universal is socialism. It means everything. Yet it means nothing in particular.

Socialism, then, is a Universal (in thought, mind you, a concept). It is as a germ, it contains a lot of things in it. This germ takes determinate form, a _particular_ form. This is _its_ being, as for example in _The Communist Manifesto_ or in the Manifesto of the First International. The Notion as Universal becomes a determinate notion. But in the Doctrine of Being when nothing became something, it was a simple “immediate”. Not so in the Notion. When the Universal of socialism becomes determinate, this is no simple immediacy. It is “equal to itself”. It is a form of mediation which is absolute. (You have to _feel_ this.) It is not there only waiting to be transformed into some Other. True it contains Intro-Reflection or Essence. It is not going to stay there forever. It will change, it will move. But to give some rough _examples_: when Marx wrote his concepts down and defined them, he did not do this looking to see contradictions in them, from which he would find a higher truth. No, that was determinate socialism. Leninism as concept and doctrine was concrete socialism. You see this in the distinction between the bourgeois revolution and the proletarian revolution (examples only). The bourgeois revolution in Russia as Lenin saw it, aimed at doing something which would create, unloose the possibility of the proletariat organising freely (as in Europe) and struggling for socialism. That was a transition. But the proletarian revolution _is_ the proletarian revolution. It is not fundamentally a transition to anything else. True it has at a given time weaknesses, defects; these will be removed. But it is posed in its own right. It is a mediation, it does not comprise the Universal in its full totality, but it is an _absolute_ mediation. It is the Notion in “principle”, a word Hegel uses often in this section, and he says that any Notion whose particular form is not the Notion in principle is no good. It is “barren”. Now comes a brilliant use of dialectic, which will give amazing results. Socialism is a Universal which in 1864 takes a determinate, concrete form. But, says Hegel, it is “clothed” in the Universal. The determinate form, what Marx writes, has certain weaknesses, defects, “differences” with the Universal. He and everybody else who has any sense knows that. The doctrines are concrete but they are not _complete_ socialism. But they are written _in terms of the Universal_: this and that and that are socialism. Therefore the doctrines of 1864 become content and the Universal becomes form, and therefore abstract. In the pure Universal it is just absolute negativity, socialism which we know will have to negate and negate until it finds it total realisation. But when it finds in principle a determinate content, this content is determinate, which makes the Universal in it abstract.

Here is the complete paragraph:

[The determinateness of the particular is simple as principle (as was seen); but it is simple also as moment of totality – as determinateness against the other determinateness. The Notion, in so far as it determines or distinguishes itself, points negatively at its unity and takes the form of one of its moments (which is of ideal nature) of being: as determinate Notion it has a Determinate Being in general. But this Being no longer signifies bare immediacy but Universality – immediacy which through absolute mediation is equal to itself and equally contains the other moment, Essence or Intro-Reflection. This Universality which clothes the determinate is abstract Universality. The particular contains Universality as its Essence; but, in so far as the determinateness of the difference is posited, and thereby has Being, this Universality is related to the difference as form, and the determinateness as such is content. Universality becomes form in so far as the difference exists as the essential- whereas in the purely universal it exists only as absolute negativity, and not as difference which is posited as such.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_608)

Now to go on. The first sentence I cannot understand – give me a few moments – but after that it is plain sailing. (Why all this excitement? Because just over the page Understanding gets a going over, is exposed, in a manner that does the heart good.) In the determinate Notion, the Notion is outside itself. It is socialism, the pure negativity. But it is determinate. Marx's doctrines, ideas, are concrete enough. They will appear in the Commune in a few years. And though there are differences between socialism, as a pure universal, and socialism in its determinate form, yet there is no other socialism and the identity is close enough. But the identity is merely “immediate”. It is not the totality, in 1864, not the full, complete idea. (Today we are much closer to this. One world, international socialism, etc.)

_In itself_, it is this completeness as the germ is _in itself_ the plant. It is _for itself_, in the determinate form, _for itself_ in principle. But although there is mediation, there are going to be further stages, yet these stages are not “posited”, the main business is not to develop what is inherent and bound to appear. The main business is what is. But precisely because we are dealing with something _in principle_, the content has the form of indifference to its Universality. It is not the totality. OK. But it is not, as in the Doctrine of Essence, unable to move a step without looking back to see what it reflects, and looking forward to see what will come. Sure we are going to mediate, but this thing here and now is good enough for us.

And now, my friends, we approach. Let the maestro speak for himself now and we shall trail along behind. (You will get some shocks, though.)

[This is the proper place also to mention the circumstance which has caused Understanding latterly to be held in such small esteem and to be ranked after Reason – namely the fixity which it imparts to the determinatenesses, and hence to the finitudes. This fixity consists in the form of abstract Universality which has just been considered: by virtue of it they become immutable.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_610)

Trotskyism, seeing that Second (_reformist_) International and Third (_revolutionary_) International and enemy-of-private property bureaucracy were embodiments “in principle” of socialism, of the Universal, which they _undoubtedly were_ completely failed to study p. 244 of the _Logic_ and recognise that these, concrete as they were, were yet abstract Universals in the sense that Hegel has so carefully explained. They were only a form. They were not totality. And precisely because they were abstract Universality, they could become fearfully fixed and ferociously finite. The very fact that they are Universals is what gives them their toughness and their staying power. In simple Being and reflective Essence, movement is easier.

[For qualitative determinateness, and Determination of Reflection, exist essentially as limited, and, in their barrier, have a relation to their Other; they thus contain the necessity of transition and passing away. But Universality (which they have in Understanding) gives them the form of Intro-Reflection, which withdraws them from the relation to other and renders them imperishable.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_610a)

Socialism! A world socialism, a revolutionary international an international that is reformist, my God ! These are not _perfected_ examples, but _they_ are not _ordinary_ manifestations. These are _Universals_. And so Understanding gets stuck with them. Universals they were, but _limited_ Universals. As Hegel says, Understanding pays these things a respect which belongs only to the “pure” Notion and only to a determinateness which was itself Universal.

[Now in the pure Notion this eternity belongs to its own nature, and so its abstract determinations would be eternal essentialities only according to their form; but their content is not adequate to this form, and consequently they are not truth and imperishability. Their content is not adequate to the form, because it is not determinateness itself as universal; that is, it is not as totality of the differentia of the Notion, or not itself the whole form . . .](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_610b)

Now I don't know, but it seems to me that Hegel, having examined phenomena and totalities of all kinds, has here extracted the process of the thought of Understanding in a manner which makes us see _our_ problems in a new and infinitely richer light. There are others coming which will startle and illuminate us. But Hegel is a dialectician. There is not only difference, there is identity, there is a connection. See how Hegel, who has been belabouring Understanding, now shows us that it has an indisputable – yes, sir – _indisputable_ place in dialectic:

[Understanding then represents the infinite force which determines the Universal, or conversely imparts fixed persistence through the form of Universality to what in determinateness has in and for itself no stability; and it is not the fault of understanding if no further progress is made.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_611)

That is clear enough. Understanding then even in the Notion is the kind of thought which determines the Universal. It is a positive quality. It says: boys, this is it. Look how this embodies the Universal. See how it represents socialism here, and there, and over there. See how this reformist International is reformism incarnate. Understanding in fact is genuinely revolutionary, and in the _establishment_ of a determinate Universal, you cannot tell the difference between it and Reason. Reason in fact uses Understanding for this purpose. (Isn't this wonderful ! The _arriere-pensee_, the things I am saying and not saying.) But Understanding is overwhelmed by these magnificent principled determinatenesses. He wants to settle down now and get to work. When Universal begins to wish to get out of this Particular, Understanding rages furiously. This, my friends, he says, is Universal. It has faults, but it is _Universal_. At last, when Understanding can stay there no longer he moves, but to do what? He says: “My friends, we have no troublesome thinking to do. The plans are here. The great architect of our now regrettably degenerated Universals, he left us the final blueprints. All we have to do is to push aside the impostors and ‘erect the old structure afresh'.”

Understanding then imparts “fixed persistence”. But, says Hegel, and this is salutary if totally unexpected:

[It is a subjective impotence of reason which allows these determinatenesses to count in this manner, and is unable to lead them back to unity through the dialectic force which is opposed to this abstract Universality, that is, through the peculiar nature (in other words, the Notion) of these determinatenesses.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_611a)

Here are two ideas of substantial importance for us. Reason leaves poor Understanding stuck in its finitudes. _Subjective_ Reason is responsible. It is too weak to overcome the gap. The effort has to be made. And how? _By seeing_ the peculiar nature, i.e. the Notion of these fixed, limited determinatenesses. That is plain enough. The Notion is a free, creative working class, a working class which is _not_ what it is in capitalism. The determinate Notion does its best, but when this is exhausted you have to get back to socialism, to your Universal of the beginning, and thus get rid of an exhausted, finite, limited particular. A new particular is needed.

Understanding _is_ mischievous. That is correct.

[It is true that through the form of abstract Universality understanding gives them what may be called such a hardness of Being as they do not possess in the spheres of Quality and of Reflection; but by this simplification understanding also spiritualises them and so sharpens them that they receive only at this extreme point the capacity of dissolving and passing over into their opposite.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_611b)

Understanding, by its obstinacy, its sticking to the finite categories, prepares them for the stage where they must be dissolved and pass over into their opposite. Bear in mind that the Universal uses a particular. When that particular is no good it throws it over. That particular perishes.

[The highest maturity or stage which any Something can reach is that in which it begins to perish.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_611c)

It is at this stage that subjective Reason is _compelled,_ COMPELLED, to intervene. We shall need that idea often.

[But this is the peculiar property of the Notion.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_611d)

Understanding commits the blunder of blunders by making the determinate Notion imperishable. The only thing imperishable is the Universality of the Notion. That quality belongs to the Notion alone

[and consequently the dissolution of the finite lies expressed in it itself, and in infinite proximity.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_611d)

It is the Universal which makes it clear that finite categories are going to be destroyed, _principled_ though they are.

[This Universality immediately argues the determinateness of the finite and expresses its inadequacy to itself. Or rather, the adequacy of the finite is already given; the abstract determinate is posited as being one with Universality, and as not for itself alone, for then it would be only determinate, but only as unity of itself and of the universal, that is, as Notion.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_612)

The general argument is clear. If not, work it out yourself.

Says Hegel, “The ordinary practice of separating Understanding and Reason must therefore be condemned in every respect.

_Understanding has its place_. It is the abuse of the fixed, limited category which is criminal. And Hegel plays on a sad but salutary note. Understanding, by carrying the thing to the heights it does, _thereby_ prepares the way for Reason to make the jump. If you are not able to say that our very _principled_ category, nationalised property, and a principled category it can seem to be, if you are not able to say: “In view of what socialism is, I have to repudiate this category and get back to fundamentals and create a new criterion,” if you cannot do that, then you persist in the determination and end by making _false_ determination the means by which you destroy everything.

I don't see how any reasonable person can deny this much: that Hegel, faced with the workers' state theorists, would be able to say, “I know those people. I have seen _that sort of thing_ happen dozens of times. I wrote about it in the Notion.”

But that is not all. The Notion has, you remember, a third division, Individual. You remember the three, Universal, Particular, _Individual_. The individual is the same as _Actuality_. The concrete. (But we are dealing with thought, the concrete is the concrete stage of _thought_.) As I see it, we have socialism, the Universal, looking for somewhere to place itself. Marxism, in general, puts forward a general programme. Let us form an International of such and such principles. That is a Particular. But on 14 May 1871, Karl Marx not in general but concretely wrote a document about the Paris Commune, and expressed certain concrete ideas, proposals, and forecasts. In the sphere of thought this document is a concrete, an Individual.

Now the Particular is midway between the Universal and the Individual When you move out of it, you can move out of it, either back to the Universal – then the Universal, disregarding the particular, “ascends to higher and highest genus” – or you “descend” (Hegel's word) into the concrete Individual. I hope the point is clear. And then comes a superb statement:

[At this point the divagation occurs by which abstraction leaves the road of the Notion and deserts the truth.’](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_619a)

This is precisely Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution. The _concrete_ struggle in Russia he ignored. Was it a bourgeois revolution? Lenin said it was and concretely waged proletarian war against the liberal bourgeoisie and the Mensheviks, their agents. His programme, his ideas, his Notion of _socialism_, yes, of _socialism_, could find its deepest profundity precisely because of that concreteness. But Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution? Hegel immediately, _immediately_ nails it. At this point he said occurs the divagation from the truth. And what form does it take?

[Its higher and highest universal to which it rises is but the surface which has less and less content.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_619b)

Precisely. The permanent revolution had no content at all. The only concrete thing that came from it was the fact that it drove Trotsky _always_ towards the Mensheviks and against Leninism, in all the long, hard, difficult years in which Bolshevism was hammered out. He scorned the concrete. As Hegel continues:

[The Individuality which it scorns is that profundity in which the Notion comprehends itself and is posited as Notion.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_619c)

If _anybody_ can understand this, we can. Trotsky soared into the thin abstractions of the permanent revolution. _Nothing came of it_. Nothing. And it was Lenin's concrete theories, dealing with the actual, the Individual, from which came all the wonderful insights and illumination which enriched the notion of _socialism_.

The Notion is concrete. It is thought but it is concrete. It is a judgment, a decision, an action, an intervention. It is not knowledge in the head for the sake of the head. Matter, society, acts by impulse, makes its knots, the knots form old categories, old categories make new categories, new categories clarify matter and society, for thought teaches me intelligent action. The categories are the highest form of matter, at any rate inseparable from matter, the form of today, which will be content tomorrow because it is content already, content posited. Without this concreteness the Notion gets _no place_. You cannot apprehend it by abstraction. Abstraction remains motionless without individuality.

[Life, Spirit, God, and also the pure Notion cannot therefore be apprehended by abstraction, because it keeps off from its products Individuality, the principle of singularity and personality, and thus reaches nothing but universalities lacking both life and spirit, colour and content.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_619d)

Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution was precisely lacking in these. Lenin it was who got from the concrete life, spirit, colour, content. But it is not only the struggles of 1905-17. The struggles of _today_ illuminate these absolutely incredible analyses of Hegel, incredible because so universally valid. The official Fourth International has no concept whatever of socialism. All Trotsky can say about Russia after twenty-five years is: revise the plan, reinstate the soviets. He has learnt nothing. The same old content, no life, no spirit, no colour. And we, have we any special life, spirit, colour? That others will have to judge. I shall go at that problem before we are done. But I repeat now as we said in _The Invading Socialist Society_: If you reprint _State and Revolution_, _The Threatening Catastrophe_, _Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?_ and _The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government_, you get a clearer picture of concrete socialism, concrete perspectives, _concrete_ action for the workers to follow than in all the writings of the Fourth International for twenty-five years.

Hegel is remorseless. And I constantly marvel at the amount of work he must have done to get the thing down so pat, _in abstractions_. He continues as follows to tear Understanding apart:

You cannot escape the consequences of the Notion. A Notion is a Notion. It embraces all the parts and they are inseparable. Understanding first of all gets Universalities lacking all colour, content, life and spirit. But these products of abstraction which have scorned the Individual, the concrete, are individuals themselves. Understanding takes the concrete and makes that into a Universal. It therefore sees the Universal only as determinate Universality: and therefore the concrete, the Individual, which it has elevated into this position has taken upon itself the tremendous task of determining itself (self-relation). For this the concrete thus pushed up into the situation of Universal is quite unfitted.

Does this sound rather abstract? Not to me. We have seen nationalised property, the concrete in Russia, taken and pushed into the position of Universal. What socialism is, what it aims at, what it means for me, all that has gone by the board. That has become the purest abstraction: the workers' parties competing peacefully in their soviets, the plan revised in the interests of the toilers, etc. etc. When you protest, you are invited to observe how much coal, steel, oil, and literacy there is. You point out that in 1928 when they were back at the 1917 level there were only maybe a few thousand, or even more, in concentration camps, etc. But every time the coal, steel, etc., are increased, the totalitarianism and the corruption increase, and so we have a graph. As production under planning increases, so every bourgeois evil increases until we have fifteen to twenty millions in concentration camps, forced labour camps, etc., and such a monstrous state as no mortal had ever imagined. It is surely time to think about socialism – examine what we meant by it and we mean by it. No, not for them. The whole thing revolves around nationalised property and _if, if_ nationalised property _continues_ to preserve the bureaucracy and commit these monstrosities, then shall we at last go back to re-examine our universal, socialism? By Christ, no. _Finish away with Marxism instead_. Throw it out. _It has failed us_. Nationalised property remains master of the field.

Here is the extract, judge for yourself:

[But the unity of the Notion is so inseparable that even these products of abstraction, while they are supposed to omit Individuality, are individuals themselves. It raises the concrete into Universality, and takes the universal only as determinate Universality: but then this is just Individuality which has resulted in the shape of self-relating determinateness. Consequently abstraction is a separation of the concrete and an isolation of its determinations: it seizes only individual properties and moments, for its product must contain that which it is itself.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_619e)

You get the last sentence? This Abstract Universal tears up the concrete into pieces. It takes isolated pieces of it, and with this as the basis of its thinking all it can now produce is what it took up and made into a Universal. That is the whole procedure of the workers' statists. Germain thinks only in terms of nationalised property, plan, dual character of the bureaucracy. He could say: in Poland nationalisation had taken place before the Russians came in. The Russians destroyed the power which the workers had their hands on and brought back elements of the bourgeois class. All Germain has to say is: it is or is not nationalised property exactly and behold at any rate the dual character of the bureaucracy. His Universal is not the careful elaboration of the basic concept which Marx and Engels made after any event – Marx on the Commune, Lenin in _State and Revolution_. No, sir. His Universal is now nationalised property and all its products bear that stamp.

See now what happens. This Universal has taken up the concrete, the Individual, into itself, pushing the real Universal into the thin air of the most abstract of abstractions. The individual as content and the Universal as form are distinct from each other. You remember that at the beginning the Universal entered freely into the First International. That programme, that conception was not perfect, but such as it was you could talk about in terms of socialism. You took the Universal as a form in which you placed, worked out the particular content which you had. You remember too that this made the Universal abstract, but an abstraction which “clothed” the particular content. But here Universal as form is one thing. Content is another. Not even Germain can use the terms of socialism to describe the Russian barbarism, and nobody today has the nerve to say any more that the proletariat in Russia is the ruling class. The Universal of Understanding, of Germain, is not absolute form. It cannot even talk in terms of those absolute necessities of socialism, workers, power, independent action, workers as masters of _themselves_, in fundamental opposition to capitalism, where the industrial system is their slave-driver. No. Germain cannot do it except as an abstraction. However inadequate the First International was, as a conception, it could “clothe” itself in these things. (This I take to be the _general_ sense of the passage. The original should be looked up in the German.) But as we continue the examination we see finally that this abstract Understanding has produced a peculiar kind of Universality. By making it so abstract and then tying it up with the concrete, the abstract Universal itself has become a concrete.

Here is the extract:

[The distinction between this individuality of its products and the Individuality of the Notion is that, in the former, the individual as content and the universal as form are distinct from each other – just because the former does not exist as absolute form, or as the Notion itself, nor the latter as the totality of form. But this closer consideration shows the abstract itself as unity of the individual content and abstract Universality, that is, as _concrete_ – which is the opposite of what it is supposed to be.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_620)

And in 1948 we do not operate in the void. The moment you lose the socialist Universal, no power on earth can save you from state-capitalist barbarism.

Now for the final passage. It offers us a good opportunity to sum up. Remember the movement of the Notion is _development_. It is free power. It is thought, mind you, the concept seeking fulfilment in thought. The _Communist Manifesto_, the_Manifesto and Programme of the First International_, Marx on the Commune, Lenin in _State and Revolution_. This is the concept developing itself. Lenin's _State and Revolution_ is a particular form of the Universal as is the programme of the Communist International and the 21 points. But the Individual concrete is the day-to-day laws, decisions, articles, decrees, speeches, etc. That is the concrete, the individual notion. So that the Universal of socialism and the particular form of _State and Revolution_ become concrete in the individual acts, ideas, places, programmes and conflicts etc. The abstract is the soul of the Individual, the concrete. Why? Because without the Universal and Particular, the concrete makes no sense. This is an advanced case of the relation between the Idea and Actuality which we dealt with in the Doctrine of Essence.

Here is the extract:

[But Individuality is not only the return of the Notion into itself; it is also immediately its loss. In Individuality it is _in_ itself; and, because of the manner in which it is in itself, it becomes external to itself and enters into actuality. Abstraction is the soul of Individuality, and, as such, is the relation of negative to negative; and it, as has been seen, is not external to the universal and the particular but immanent; and they through it are concrete, content, and individual. And Individuality as this Negativity is determinate determinateness, is distinguishing as such; through this introReflection of distinction it becomes fixed; the determining of the particular takes place only through Individuality, for it is that abstraction which now, as Individuality, is posited abstraction.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_621)

I advise you to be in no hurry. Read the passages over and over again, especially the difficult ones. Familiarise yourself with them. There is a great temptation. It is to read these, get only a general idea, and then fasten on to what is familiar – the purely social and political analysis that I make following these technical sections. If you do that you will never learn to handle the _Logic_. Work at these technical passages for what they teach but also as exercises, until they sink in, and you begin to think in those terms.

We now have to do one last passage from this Introduction to the Notion. Do not be misled by my hopping and skipping and jumping as I _have_ to do, into forgetting that the internal consistency, the structural logic of the logic itself is marvellous. Development into development, in general, then split into its parts, and the development of the first gone over again, but now at a higher level and a deeper penetration, to explode, leap into something higher, whereupon the old processes gain new depths, etc. This is precisely _logic_. It is not life, i.e. history. And only when logic is a logical, impeccable movement, can you then deal with the innumerable manifestations of life. This I can only mention and motion to here and there in passing. But to demonstrate that, no, not me.

So before he ends the Notion in general, Hegel goes back to something which has always concerned him. He began it in the Doctrine of Being – Quality – with the real infinite and the dead infinite. He went back at it in the Doctrine of Essence in Ground, and the Being or not-Being of the Finite as the basis of Ground. Now he has shown us how the Universal takes a particular from in the Particular and becomes concrete in the Individual- You cannot understand the Individual unless you see it as a concreting of the Universal, and positing further abstraction of the Universal because from it the Universal will find the basis of still further abstractions. For the Individual is going to move on. Now:

[The individual, then, as self-relating negativity, is immediate selfidentity of the negative; it is-for-self. In other words it is abstraction which determines the Notion, according to its moment (which is of ideal nature) of Being, as _immediate_. Thus the individual is a qualitative One or This.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_621a)

He takes it back to quality, the Doctrine of Being. Now remember your Doctrine of Being:

[According to this quality it is, first, self-repulsion, by which process the many other Ones are presupposed; and secondly, it is negative relation against these presupposed others; and, in so far, the individual is exclusive.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_621a)

But – as Rosa Luxemburg used to write – attention! Universality must watch its relation to these concrete Ones. Universality is a moment of the concrete, the Individual. But it is not merely an element of the Individual.

[If by the universal is meant that which is common to more than one individual, then the beginning is being made from their indifferent persistence, and the immediacy of Being is mixed with the determination of the Notion. The lowest possible image of the universal in its relation to the individual is this external relation of it as a mere common element.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlsubjec.htm#HL3_621b)

You say that whatever form a concrete workers' state may take, it is distinguished always by nationalised property. It is the lowest possible form of the Universal. The rest of the section takes this up in detail. Hegel, particularly here in the Notion, insists that Individuality is posited “not in the external but in a notional distinction” – nationalised property is to be seen in the light of your notion of what socialism is. _Don't do that_. Don't make the mistake of taking this concrete, this merely common persistent element as the Universal! You then will, as sure as day, end by making _it_ all your notion. Then you say: the world has now reached a stage where capitalism can no longer continue. From this you say that this economy must obviously be nationalised and planned. You then say that if the Russian bureaucracy continues for a long time, after the war, it is obviously the precursor of a new ruling class. Then we have to agree that the Marxist expectation of socialism is a Utopia. That is where you land in thought and we are dealing with thought. That Trotsky as an individual would have thrown himself on the side of the masses and would have repudiated pessimism and defeatism in the heat of the class struggle, that we haven't to argue about. But the whole methodology had within it the destruction of the basis on which he stood. For he stated most precisely that the Russian bureaucracy would restore private property. So that although the time of its continuance is not too important (the world situation being what it is) the obvious determination of the bureaucracy to _maintain_ nationalised property and fight another world war for it, this, eats at the heart of those who insist on carrying on Trotsky's method. He made a finite into an infinite. He took the being of the finite and made it into an Absolute. He took a moment of the Universal, and made it into the Universal itself. Whence these tears. Hegel is not finished with this by the way. In his last section of the Idea of Cognition, he takes this finite and finite, being and not-being of the Absolute, common persistence in the Notion and finally lays it to rest in a masterly display on the Definition. But I can tell you in advance that I shall leave out the Definition. Too much is involved.

And now before we go on, do me a little favour, friends. Just sit down and read this whole previous section over. No? OK. As Marx said in the last paragraph of the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_, do what you like now. I have saved my own soul.

The Hegelian Logic

### Leninism and the Notion

---

  

The discerning reader (the sceptical reader we may ignore, the hostile reader we are striking murderous wounds at in every paragraph), the discerning reader will now be saying: “Amazing, I agree. This Hegel seems to have worked out a way by which men, once they slip off the rails, can be seen to follow as if bewitched certain patterns of thought. Your illustrations directed against Trotskyism certainly illuminate Trotskyism. But on the whole, this, valuable as it is, is in this instance negative. You say, for instance, Trotsky’s Universal is without colour, content, etc. – pure abstraction. What is yours, using the dialectic method? Show me how you, by not ascending to “higher and highest genus” but by sticking to Individuality enrich _your_ Universal. You say, Lenin did in Russia before 1917. I agree, more or less. I am a discerning reader. I see that you are working up, stage by stage, a positive position. I think it is about time that we paid more attention to that and less to Trotskyism.”

Correct on the whole, _but only on the whole_. But we are now going to settle down to a concrete and not a general exposition of dialectical thinking which will show us the Notion in action. The proof will be the result. And to set all doubt at rest, let me say here at once: I propose, step by step, to build up a positive line of development, I have been doing this, which will end in an unmistakably concrete Notion of socialism as Universal and the revolutionary struggle today, _and_ tomorrow, not tomorrow in general, but our tomorrow. This work would be useless, in fact reactionary (I cannot stay to explain) if it did not do that. But the correct method of doing that is the method I am following. It will be easier for those who follow after. I am starting from scratch.

But this job is preliminary to that. Patience. Patience. Patience. Work your way in. We have to get a notion of socialism, the notion of 1948. But we have to work through Leninism. _Today our movement is not beyond Leninism_. The proletariat is far beyond the proletariat of Lenin’s day. But our movement is not. To get beyond him, we have to go into and through him. But the process demands, _for us_, the complete, the patient exposure of Trotskyism from all sides. We are not finished with that. Learn from Hegel. Learn how to go back and back and back again to Understanding, until the method becomes part of the structure, the structure of the mind. Strive to get “quite _simple_ insight” into the whole business. You will read the _Logic_ and find out things for yourself. If you haven’t the time or energy for that great task, read these extracts, over and over again, working out the interpretations, making new ones, getting to know them almost by heart. It would be a catastrophe if you read this with the idea that it was only a justification, a preparation for our concrete theories. Worse still, if when it was all over someone said: “Good. Now what do we do now. How do we put it into practice in the class struggle?” God help us, _that_ attitude would be pretty awful. I don’t think any of us will have it.

But I am writing _en famille_ and as these ideas strike me, I put them down. I am a bit nervous, you see, that as we expand our theory, and clarify ourselves _politically_, all the work on the _Logic_ will seem to have been done with this purpose. Enough of that. Logic for theory, but at this stage also, for us, logic for logic’s sake.

This being said, however, we can now move in the theoretical sphere. We are now equipped to tackle Leninism, the highest point of our movement so far. We have to mount to that height to move on into the infinite, the uncharted infinite that faces _us_.

If the discussion rages around the political conclusions as such, and not around the political conclusions in lgical terms, then, immediately at least, the time has been wasted.

### Dialectical Materialism and  
the Fate of Humanity

---

Mankind has obviously reached the end of something. The crisis is absolute. Bourgeois civilisation is falling apart, and even while it collapses, devotes its main energies to the preparation of further holocausts. Not remote states on the periphery but regimes contending for world power achieve the most advanced stages of barbarism known to history. What civilised states have ever approached Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia in official lies, official murder and the systematic brutalisation and corruption of their population? Only a shallow empiricism can fail to see that such monstrous societies are not the product of a national peculiarity (the German character) or a system of government (“communism”) but are part and parcel of our civilisation. Everything that has appeared in these monstrous societies is endemic in every contemporary nation. Millions in the United States know that Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia will have nothing to teach the American bourgeoisie when it finds itself threatened by the revolutionary American workers seeking the complete expression of democracy which is socialism. The dream of progress has become the fear of progress. Men shrink with terror at the hint of scientific discoveries. If it were known tomorrow that the crown of human technical achievement, the processes of manufacturing atomic energy, had been lost beyond recovery, this scientific disaster would be hailed as the greatest good fortune of decades.

But the seal of the bankruptcy of bourgeois civilisation is the bankruptcy of its thought. Its intellectuals run to and fro squealing like hens in a barnyard when a plane passes overhead. Not a single philosopher or publicist has any light to throw on a crisis in which the fate not of a civilisation but of civilisation itself is involved. The Keynesian theories are now part of the history of economics. The ridiculous “four freedoms” of the late President Roosevelt take their place with the _Three Principles_ of Sun Yat-Sen (the father-in-law of Chiang Kai-shek), the thousand years of Hitler’s Reich and the “socialism in a single country” of Stalin. The chattering of Sidney Hook and Harold Laski is stunned into silence by the immensity of their own inadequacies. Thought has abdicated. The world is rudderless. All illusions have been destroyed. “Man is at last compelled to face with sober sense his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.” And in face of this the bourgeoisie has nothing to say.

The method of thinking is rooted in society. Bourgeois thought has collapsed because bourgeois society has collapsed. We have learnt by hard necessity the truth of the following dictum of Trotsky:

“Hegel in his Logic established a series of laws: change of quantity into quality, development through contradictions, conflict of content and form, interruption of continuity, change of possibility into inevitability, etc., which are just as important for theoretical thought as is the simple syllogism for more elementary tasks.” (Trotsky, [**In Defence of Marxism**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/12/abc.htm#abc7))

Hegel defines the principle of Contradiction as follows:

“Contradiction is the root of all movement and life, and it is only in so far as it contains a contradiction that anything moves and has impulse and activity.” ([**Science of Logic**, Vol. 2, p. 67](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl431.htm#HL2_439))

The first thing to note is that Hegel makes little attempt to prove this. A few lines later he says:

“With regard to the assertion that contradiction does not exist, that it is non-existent, we may disregard this statement.”

We here meet one of the most important principles of the dialectical logic, and one that has been consistently misunderstood, vilified or lied about. Dialectic for Hegel was a strictly scientific method. He might speak of inevitable laws, but he insists from the beginning that the proof of dialectic as scientific method is that the laws prove their correspondence with reality. Marx’s dialectic is of the same character. Thus he excluded what later became The **Critique of Political Economy** from **Capital** because it took for granted what only the detailed argument and logical development of **Capital** could prove. Still more specifically, in his famous letter to Kugelmann on the theory of value, he ridiculed the idea of having to “prove” the labour theory of value. If the labour theory of value proved to be the means whereby the real relations of bourgeois society could be demonstrated in their movement, where they came from, what they were, and where they were going, that was the proof of the theory. Neither Hegel nor Marx understood any other scientific proof.

To ask for some proof of the laws, as Burnham implied, or to prove them “wrong” as Sidney Hook tried to do, this is to misconceive dialectical logic entirely. Hegel complicated the question by his search for a completely closed system embracing all aspects of the universe; this no Marxist ever did. The frantic shrieks that Marx’s dialectic is some sort of religion or teleological construction, proving inevitably the victory of socialism, spring usually from men who are frantically defending the inevitability of bourgeois democracy against the proletarian revolution.

So convinced a Marxist as Trotsky reminded the revolutionaries in 1939 that Marxists were not fatalists.

“If”, said he, “the international proletariat, as a result of the experience of our entire epoch and the current new war, proves incapable of becoming the master of society, this would signify the foundering of all hope for a socialist revolution, for it is impossible to expect any other more favourable condition for it.”

The Marxian expectation of socialism arising from the contradictions of capitalism would have proved itself to be utopia.

The law of contradiction is what for the moment we can call a “hypothesis” for the grouping of empirical facts. All men use hypotheses for the grouping of facts. That is what logic consists of. The bourgeois hypotheses are for the most part unconscious. They are the inevitability of bourgeois society, natural division of labour, more particularly of men into capitalists and workers, constantly expanding technical progress, constantly expanding production, constantly expanding democracy, constantly rising culture. But during the last thirty years, these have crumbled to dust in their hands. They have no hypotheses they can believe in and that is why they cannot think. Historical facts, large and small, continuously deliver shattering blows at the foundation of their logical system. Nothing remains for them but the logic of the machine gun, and the crude empiricism of police violence.

Quite different is the mode of thought of Marxism. It understands its own logical laws. For Marxists, the fundamental logical law is the contradictory nature of all phenomena and first of all human society. The dialectic teaches that in all forms of society we have known, the increasing development of material wealth brings with it the increasing degradation of the large mass of humanity. Capitalism, being the greatest wealth-producing system so far known, has carried its contradictions to a pitch never known before. Thus it is that the moment when the world system of capitalism has demonstrated the greatest productive powers in history is exactly the period when barbarism threatens to engulf the whole of society. The anti-dialecticians stand absolutely dumbfounded before the spectacle of the mastery of nature for human advancement and the degradation of human nature by this very mastery. The greater the means of transport, the less men are allowed to travel. The greater the means of communication, the less men freely interchange ideas. The greater the possibilities of living, the more men live in terror of mass annihilation. The bourgeoisie cannot admit this, for to admit it is themselves to sanction the end of the bourgeois civilisation.

Hence the complete paralysis of bourgeois thought. Yet never was thought of a fundamental character so necessary to mankind. As our political tendency has recently written:

It is precisely the character of our age and the maturity of humanity that obliterates the opposition between theory and practice, between the intellectual preoccupations of the “educated” and of the masses. All the great philosophical concepts, from the nature of the physical universe (atomic energy) through the structure and function of productive systems (free enterprise, “socialism”, or “communism”), the nature of government (the state versus the individual), to the destiny of man (can mankind survive?), these are no longer “theory”, but are in the market-place, tied together so that they cannot be separated, matters on which the daily lives of millions upon millions depend. (**The Invading Socialist Society**)

Never were such universal questions asked by the whole of the civilised world. Never have such inadequate answers been given. All that the bourgeoisie can answer is the purely technical question of the manufacture of atomic energy, and it wishes that it could not.

Now it is precisely because this contradiction of society has reached its farthest point in Stalinist Russia that the dialectical materialist analysis of Russia is the most important key to the perspective of world civilisation.

The second law of dialectical materialism is the change of quantity into quality. At a certain stage a developing contradiction, so to speak, explodes, and both the elements of contradiction are thereby altered. In the history of society these explosions are known as revolution. All the economic, social and political tendencies of the age find a point of completion which becomes the starting-point of new tendencies. The Russian revolution is one such explosion. But the examination of the Russian revolution involves both the laws of development through contradictions and the change of quantity into quality.

Let us examine the Russian revolution in some of its most important features, such as would be agreed upon by most observers, excepting the diehard reactionaries.

The revolution was the greatest outburst of social energy and creativity that we have yet seen. Previously the French revolution had astonished mankind by the rapidity and grandeur of its achievements. So much so that to this day 14 July 1789 is the date in all probability most widely known among the great majority of mankind. But the Russian revolution exceeded the French. A combination of workers and peasants, the lowest classes of mankind, tore up an established government by the roots and accomplished the greatest social overturn in history. Starting from nothing, they created a new state, created an army of millions, defended the new regime against famine, blockade and wars of intervention on all fronts. They reorganised the economy. They made Russia a modern state. They passed and tried honestly to carry out a series of laws on popular education, equality of women, repudiation of religious superstition, sexual sanity, workers’ control of production, all of which constituted the greatest potential democracy and enlightenment that the world had ever seen. They organised a world-wide Communist International devoted to the achievement of the same ideals in the entire world. The gradual decline and final failure are treated in the text. But the accomplishments are history, imperishable and of permanent significance for mankind. Taken in its entirety the heroic period of the Russian revolution is the most glorious episode in human history.

Lenin, the leader of the revolution, claimed always that one of the greatest achievements was the establishment of a new type of democracy, the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, which was able to unloose the creative energies of the great masses of the people. Their mere administration of the state in his opinion would make the further existence of capitalism impossible. This administration by the masses is “not yet” socialism, but it is no longer capitalism. “It is a tremendous step towards socialism, a step from which, if complete democracy is retained, no backward step towards capitalism would be possible without the most atrocious violence perpetrated upon the masses”. (**The Threatening Catastrophe**) Capital, in the form of state capital, once more rules in Russia. Democracy has not been retained. But this has been done only at the cost of the condition foreseen by Lenin. The most atrocious violence has been perpetrated upon the masses of the people. Thus, the Russian revolution, as it has developed and declined, shows us the two most violent extremes that we have known in history. It is only dialectical materialism that can unite these extremes in logical and intelligible connection. It is the creative power, the democratic desires, the expansion of human personality, the record of achievement that was the Russian revolution. It is these which have called forth the violence, the atrocities, the state organised as Murder Incorporated. Only such violence could have repressed such democracy.

One can see the glint in the eye of the enemy of the proletarian revolution. Without perspective, himself, intellectually helpless before the contemporary barbarism, indulging in nonsensical opposites like Yogis and Commissars, or searching diligently in his own writhing insides for the solution to the problems of the world, he hastens to use the fact of the Russian degeneration as an unanswerable argument against the ideas of Bolshevism. Patience, my friend, patience.

“Bolshevism”, says Trotsky, “is above all a philosophy of history and a political conception.” Without the philosophy, the political conception falls to the ground. We have to get to the philosophy step by step. We have arrived at this much. The atrocious violence and crimes which now distinguish the state of Stalin are the necessary and inevitable response to the revolutionary fervour and democratic organisation and expression of the Russian people. Not the Russian people in general, however, but the Russian people as they had developed and expressed themselves in the socialist revolution of 1917. This is not merely a Russian phenomenon. The Russian revolution is a climax to a series of revolutions which have moved according to certain laws. Briefly: The British revolution in the seventeenth century embraced only small sections of the population – some revolutionary bourgeois, petty-bourgeois farmers and yeomen and a small number of artisans, and others in the few and small towns. They could not create the new but they could destroy the old. The work of the revolution having been accomplished, the counter-revolution, heir to the new social order, established itself by a mere invitation to Charles II to return. A handful of people only were punished. With the development of economy and its socialisation, i.e. the increasing inter-relation of all classes in production, the French revolution embraces the great mass of the nation. The revolution destroys feudalism and establishes the modern state.

Its basic work accomplished, “order” must be restored to society by the counter-revolution, the heirs to the new regime, but this time there are millions of aroused people. It is the great body of the nation which is to be disciplined. No mild return of royalty, no forgiveness, no mutual amnesty. Only the military police-dictatorship of Napoleon can hold this country down. The contradiction between the revolution and the counter-revolution has sharpened.

Society established itself on new foundations. But the contradiction between the classes grows. If the revolution in Russia was the broadest and deepest development of the revolution of the seventeenth century, the Stalinist regime is the similar development of the counter-revolution. The German revolution of 1918 did not overthrow bourgeois property. But the German proletariat, infinitely larger and more highly developed than the Russian, had a long history of democratic achievement and organisation behind it. After the revolution, its organisation continued and expanded. That is why the Nazi counter-revolution was as brutal as it was. But if the German proletariat in 1918 had established a Soviet state embracing workers, agricultural proletarians and semi-proletarians, the lower ranks of the petty-bourgeoisie and the sympathetic intelligentsia, then logically speaking one of two things would have happened. Either the new democratic formation would have gone on from strength to strength awakening the deepest reserves of social power and aspirations of the already highly-developed German people and spreading throughout Europe; either this or something else. The atrocities and the violence which would have been needed to suppress a successful German proletarian revolution and the response it would have awakened in the German and other European peoples would have exceeded the crimes of Hitler as much as Hitler exceeded the crimes of Napoleon.

The pervading barbarism of the Stalinist regime, therefore, is not to be attributed to this or that weakness in the theory of “communism”, or some partial aspect of the Stalinist state. Stage by stage, we have seen the revolution and the counter-revolution develop in Europe over the centuries. At each new stage of development, both the revolution and the counter-revolution assume a new quality with the new quality of the social development. Precisely because the Russian revolution assumed a new quality in attempting to establish a universal democracy, the Russian counter-revolution assumes a new quality of universal barbarism in the sense that it embraces all aspects of the Russian state.

At this stage, to try to separate progressive aspects from so comprehensive and all-pervading an enemy of human development as is the Stalinist state, is to strike down the dialectical method at the root. Hegel understood the limits within which one could designate a corruption as partial:

The Reformation resulted from the corruption of the Church. That corruption was not an accidental phenomenon; it is not the mere abuse of power and domination. A corrupt state of things is very frequently represented as an “abuse” ; it is taken for granted that the foundation was good – the system, the institution itself faultless – but that the passion, the subjective interest, in short the arbitrary volition of men has made use of that which in itself was good to further its own selfish ends, and that all that is required to be done is to remove these adventitious elements. On this showing the institute in question escapes obloquy, and the evil that disfigures it appears something foreign to it. But when accidental abuse of a good thing really occurs it is limited to particularity. A great and general corruption affecting a body of such large and comprehensive scope as a Church is quite another thing. ... The corruption of the Church was a native growth. ([**Philosophy of History**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/hiconten.htm))

The Russian revolution is the completion of a historical process, the development of class society. Its relation to past revolution can be illuminated by the laws of changes of quantity into quality. The British revolution, although it pointed the road for the rest of Europe, was only to a subordinate degree of international significance. The French revolution shook the whole of Europe to its foundations and established the logical lines along which revolution and counter-revolution would struggle in Europe for the succeeding century. It is in the very nature of modern society and the Russian revolution that Russia today is symbolical of the whole fate of modern civilisation. There is no further stage. Either the revolution succeeds in encompassing the whole of the world or the whole of the world collapses in counter-revolution and barbarism. The whole path of Western civilisation for two thousand years has reached an ultimate stage in Russia. There is no by-pass. There is no third alternative.

Therefore, as dialectical materialists, we do not bewail nor do we underestimate or in any way attempt to minimise the monstrous character of the Stalinist regime. We repudiate utterly any idea that what is there has any socialist character whatever. But we draw from it for Russia itself and for the whole world an ultimate, a universal conclusion. The barbarism is not to come. It is there.

In our previously quoted pamphlet, we have written:

The unending murders, the destruction of peoples, the bestial passions, the sadism, the cruelties and the lusts, all the manifestations of barbarism of the last thirty years are unparalleled in history. But this barbarism exists only because nothing else can suppress the readiness for sacrifice, the democratic instincts and creative power of the great masses of the people.

Those are the two forces in conflict. The philosophy of history which is Bolshevism bases itself upon the destruction of the barbarism by the inevitable triumph of the socialist revolution. There are even revolutionaries who deny this. For them it is not scientific to believe in inevitability. Such a belief implies that dialectic is a religion or mysticism. For them the correct scientific attitude is to reserve judgement. Yet these very ones turn out to be the mystics and the practitioners of an ill-concealed religiosity.

If they recognise the bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy, if they accept the need for universality in the masses, if they recognise that barbarism is the only force that can suppress this need, then to refuse to accept the inevitability of socialism leaves only one of two choices. Either the inevitability of barbarism, that is to say, the acceptance of the principle of inevitability which they have just rejected or the hope, the faith, the belief that history will offer some way out of the impasse. This is the denial of a philosophy of history, that is to say, the denial of a method of thought, for which the only name is irrationalism or mysticism.

The deniers of the inevitability of socialism can be routed both historically and logically.

Marx developed his philosophical doctrines in the years which preceded the 1848 revolutions. The revolution was obviously on the way. Yet society was dominated by the experience of the great French revolution which had achieved such miracles but had failed to achieve universality (liberty, equality and fraternity), and despite all its sacrifices and bloodshed, had ended in the triumph of the counter-revolution. The experience of 1830 had only multiplied both the fears and the hopes which had been engendered by the colossal experience of the French revolution. In this period, so similar to ours, philosophy came out of the study, particularly in Germany, and attempted to give some answers to the problems that were shaking society.

The utopian socialists of all stripes were distinguished precisely by this, that they argued interminably about the possibility as opposed to the inevitability of the socialist revolution. They were tortured by these doubts because, after the experience of the French revolution and its obvious failure to relieve the conditions of the great masses of the people, they themselves had lost faith in the inevitability of socialism. Which is only another way of saying the inevitability of the achievement by the people of complete self-expression, complete democracy, socialism. In so far as their beliefs were the result of theoretical speculation, they had, in the words of Marx, lost the capacity to draw from the experience of man’s past in order to establish perspectives for man’s future.

The result was a complete chaos, disorder, confusion in their own thoughts with an absolute inability to meet the challenge of the approaching revolution. It was into this ulcer that Marx drove the knife of scientific socialism. Bolshevism is a philosophy of history. Marx first clarified himself philosophically. As he wrote to Ruge in 1843:

Almost greater than the outer obstacles appear in the inner difficulties. For although there is no doubt about the “whence”, there prevails the more confusion about the “whither”. Not only has a general anarchy broken out among the reformers; each of them also must himself confess that he has no exact conception of what ought to be. Precisely in this is the advantage of the new movement, that we do not anticipate the new world dogmatically but intend to find the new in the criticism of the old world. Up to now the philosophers have had the solution of all riddles lying in their desks and the dumb exoteric world had only to gape in order for the ready-baked pies of wisdom to fly into their mouths. Philosophy has become worldly, and the most decisive proof of this is that philosophic consciousness has been drawn into the anguish of the struggle not only superficially but thoroughly. If the construction of the future and the preparation for all time is not our affair, it is all the more certain what we have to complete at present, i.e., the most relentless criticism of all existing things, relentless both in the sense that the criticism fears no results and even less fears conflicts with the existing powers.

We face the same situation today in the radical and revolutionary movement. In 1947, however, not only is philosophy worldly. In the face of the universal character of the crisis, the world is driven to become philosophical. It is compelled to examine in their nature and in the totality of their relations (that is to say, philosophically), economics, politics, science and even the very nature of the universe and society. All agitation about the possibility of barbarism, third alternatives, the mysticism of the inevitability of socialism, these are no more than what they were in Marx’s day, only infinitely more so: terror before the destructive contradictions of modern society, doubts of the capacity of the proletariat to resolve them. This amounts to no more than a defence of bourgeois society in so far as bourgeois society still can provide thinkers with freedom enough to substitute the analysis of their own thoughts for a positive intervention in the chaos of society.

So far historically. Logically, the inevitability of socialism is the absolute reverse of religion or mysticism. It is a consciously constructed necessity of thought. As we have quoted in the article on Historical Retrogression, Hegel recognised that without holding fast in thought to your ultimate goal, it is impossible to think properly.

To hold fast the positive in its negative, and the content of the presupposition in the result, is the most important part of rational cognition: also only the simplest reflection is needed to furnish conviction of the absolute truth and necessity of this requirement, while with regard to the examples of proofs, the whole of Logic consists of these. ([**Logic**, Vol. II, p. 476](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlabsolu.htm#HL3_834a))

Precisely because they held fast to the presupposition of the inevitability of bourgeois society, the bourgeois thinkers in the early days of capitalism made their tremendous contributions to the science of human thought. Even without philosophical perspective, the bourgeoisie at least has one reality, maintenance of power against the workers and rival bourgeoisies. But without presupposing the inevitability of socialism, that is to say, without thinking always in terms of the victory of the masses, thinking among those hostile to bourgeois society must become a form of scholasticism and gnosticism, self-agitation and caprice.

Over a hundred years ago, Hegel said that the simplest reflection will show the necessity of holding fast the positive in the negative, the presupposition in the result, the affirmation that is contained in every negation, the future that is in the present. It is one of the signs of the advanced stage of human development that this is not longer a mere philosophical but a concrete question. To anyone that does not accept bourgeois society, the simplest reflection shows that it is impossible not only to think but to take any kind of sustained positive action in the world today unless one postulates the complete victory of the great masses of the people. What is this but the exemplification in life of the logical theory, the inevitability of socialism? The Stalinist state, the Nazi state, and in their varying degrees all states today, based upon property and privilege, are the negation of the complete democracy of the people. It is this state which is to be destroyed, that is to say, it is this state which is to be negated by the proletarian revolution. Thus, the inevitability of socialism is the inevitability of the negation of the negation, the third and most important law of the dialectic. I have said earlier that the laws of the dialectic are “hypotheses”.

Any Deweyite pragmatist who is rubbing his hands with joy at this “reasonable” Marxism is in for rude disillusionment. “Dialectics”, said Lenin, “is the theory of knowledge of (Hegel and) Marxism.” So far I have been dealing with it as a theory of knowledge, as a mode of thought, examining more or less empirically contemporary society and the Russian revolution, and showing how by means of the dialectical approach, some order, some perspective, some understanding come out of them, showing equally why the bourgeoisie can make no sense of anything except to hold on to power.

But Marx’s hypotheses were not hypotheses in general. They were not empirically arrived at, tentatively used, discarded if not satisfactory, experimental or instrumentalist. They were logical abstractions organised according to the method of Hegel and reflecting the movement of human society. This is no simple matter. But it has remained obscured and neglected too long.

The dialectic is a theory of knowledge, but precisely for that reason, it is a theory of the nature of man. Hegel and Marxism did not first arrive at a theory of knowledge which they applied to nature and society. They arrived at a theory of knowledge from their examination of men in society. Their first question was: What is man? What is the truth about him? Where has he come from and where is he going? They answered that question first because they knew that without any answer to that general question, they could not think about particular questions.

Both Hegel and Marx in their different ways believed that man is destined for freedom and happiness. They did not wish this (or they did, that does not matter). They came to this conclusion by examining man’s history as a totality. Man for Marx was not Christian man nor the man of the French revolution (nor Stalin’s bloodstained secret police). The concept of man was a constantly developing idea which was headed for some sort of completeness. When Marx said that with the achievement of the socialist revolution the “real” history of humanity will begin, he was not being rhetorical or inspiring (or optimistic). He was being strictly and soberly scientific.

The truth is the whole. The whole, however, is merely the essential nature reaching its completeness through the process of its own development. Of the Absolute it must be said that it is essentially a result, that only at the end is it what it is in very truth.

Thus Hegel in the [**Phenomenology of Mind**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm); Marx worked on the same principles. The essential nature of man was becoming clear only as it approached its completeness in bourgeois society. It is in bourgeois society that we could see what man really is. And it is “only at the end” of bourgeois society that we can see what man is in very truth. Thus it is in the contemporary barbarism that can be seen most clearly what is the “real” nature of humanity. The need and desire for socialism, for complete democracy, for complete freedom, that is the “real” nature of man. It is this which explains his past. But it could be expressed within the concrete circumstances of past ages only to the degree that objective circumstances allowed. Did man, therefore, suffer through all those centuries to produce completed man? The defenders of bourgeois society are ready to defend and rage over all these unjustified sufferings of past mankind in their die-hard opposition to the proletarian revolution which will relieve present mankind. They will get nothing to comfort themselves with. “The truth is the whole.” All the various stages constitute the nature of man. Continues Hegel:

“And just in that consists its nature, which is to be actual, subject or self-becoming, self-development.”

Man is the subject, that which is developing itself. The subject becomes more and more real, and therefore the truth about man becomes deeper and wider, more universal, more complex, more concrete. Complete universality, complete democracy in the sense that every man is able to do what every other man does, this is the ultimate stage. The Russian revolution was an imperfect, limited, handicapped but nevertheless decisive step in this direction. The nature of man, therefore, becomes the search for this completeness and the overcoming of the obstacles which stood and stand in its way. Past history therefore becomes intelligible and what is more important, the road to the solution of the overwhelming problems to the present day becomes open.

If today we say that now we know what is the “real” man, it is because we see him as a totality, as the result of his whole past. But from there we make another step. The terrible crisis of civilisation is the result of the fact that man is at last real, he has become himself, completely developed. But the old type of world which developed him cannot contain him. He must burst through it. That world was a world in which he was subjected to nature. It was in the subjection of nature that he fully realised himself, a continuous negation of the obstacles which impeded his development. That being accomplished, his real history will begin. He negates all that has previously impeded him, i.e. negated him, in the full realisation of his inherent nature. Socialism is the negation of all previous negations. It is obvious that these are large conceptions. But the death of a world civilisation is not a small thing.

The conception being stated, it is now necessary not to prove it (only life can do that) but to show where it came from.

Western civilisation, and therefore, the Hegelian dialectic begins with Christianity. It was Christianity which established universality in its most abstract form, that very universality which we are now seeing concretely striving for expression in the proletariat all over the contemporary world. The very early or “primitive” Christians attempted a universality that was extremely concrete, commonalty of goods and absolute equality. But it soon collapsed. The abstract universality was established by that historical Christianity which superseded the Roman Empire. Christianity united all men, before birth, in the universality of original sin, and after death, in the possibility of universal redemption in heaven. Thus it carefully avoided a concrete universality. It was the religion of the millions who had been released from slavery by the collapse of the Roman Empire. The narrow straitened circumstances of their material lives were compensated for by the subjective conception of an after-life in which all their material needs would be satisfied or, better still, there would be no need for material satisfactions at all. But, extreme abstraction though it was, man is for the first time established as universal man. Hegel expresses the idea in all its fullness in the [**Philosophy of History**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/hiconten.htm):

Man, finite when regarded for himself, is yet at the same time the Image of God and a fountain of infinity in himself. He is the object of his own existence – has in himself an infinite value, an external destiny. Consequently, he has his true home in a supersensuous world – an infinite subjectivity, gained only by a rupture with mere natural existence and violation, and by his labour to break their power from within.... These conditions are not yet a concrete order, but simply the first abstract principles, which are won by the instrumentality of the Christian religion for the secular state. First, under Christianity slavery is impossible; for man as man – in the abstract essence of his nature – is contemplated in God; each unit of mankind is an object of the grace of God and of the Divine purpose; “God will have all men to be saved.” Utterly excluding all speciality, therefore, man, in and for himself – in his simple quality of man – has infinite value; and this infinite value abolishes, ipso facto, all particularity attaching to birth or country.

This is what Hegel calls an abstract universal. The history of humanity is no more than this abstract universal becoming concrete.

International socialism is the concrete embodiment of the abstract principle of Christianity. And Christianity appeared and international socialism is now appearing because they are of the very nature of man. To call the recognition of this teleology and religion is a sign of the greatest ignorance, or, is not ignorance, but a determination at all costs to defend bourgeois society against the philosophy of Bolshevism today so as not to have to defend it against the revolutionary masses tomorrow. To have been Christian and to be socialist is an expression of the need for concrete universality which is not so much in as of the very nature of man.

And dialectic bases itself upon this precisely because it is not religious and not teleological. If this, scientifically speaking, is not the nature of man, then what do the opponents of dialectic offer instead? Either man has expressed these desires and these aims by accident, i.e. they have no significance whatever, for he might have expressed entirely different aims and had entirely different needs, and may do so tomorrow. Or these needs and aims are not the nature of man but came from some outside agency or God.

It is only in the sense described above that dialectic speaks of freedom and happiness being the purpose of man’s existence. Purpose, not in the religious sense, but in the sense that if we examine man’s history through the centuries he has sought these aims. It is difficult therefore to say what other purpose his existence has, and the anti-dialectician is left with the alternative that man’s life has no purpose at all, which is only another way of accommodating one’s self to the existing society, bourgeois society.

The logical principle of universality contains within it a logical contradiction, the contradiction of abstract and concrete. This logical contradiction is a direct reflection of the objective circumstances in which the men of early Christianity lived. Their physical and material circumstances were on the lowest possible level. And therefore, to make their existence a totality, they had to fill it out with this tremendous abstraction. Thus is established the basic logical contradiction in the universal between concrete and abstract, between objective and subjective, between real and ideal, between content and form. But both together form a whole and have no meaning apart from each other. They are opposites but interpenetrated. To Christian man, the conception of heaven was real and necessary, an integral part of his existence in the objective world. Those who accuse dialectics of being a religion understand neither dialectics nor religion. The history of man is his effort to make the abstract universal concrete. He constantly seeks to destroy, to move aside, that is to say, to negate what impedes his movement towards freedom and happiness. Man is the subject of history. “(The) subject, (man) is pure and simple negativity.” This is a cardinal principle of the dialectical movement. The process is molecular, day by day never resting, continuous. But at a certain stage, the continuity is interrupted. The molecular changes achieve a universality and explode into a new quality, a revolutionary change.

Previous to the revolutionary explosion, the aims of the struggle can be posed in partial terms, possibility. It is the impossibility of continuing to do this that interrupts the continuity.

The revolution, precisely because it is a revolution, demands all things for all men. It is an attempt to leap from the realm of objective necessity to the realm of objective freedom.

But in the limited objective circumstances to which the low level of productivity has confined society, what is demanded by, of and for all men, only some men can have. The concrete universality, therefore, becomes the property of some men, a class. They are therefore compelled to use objective violence against those excluded and to substitute an abstract universality for the concrete universality of which the mass has been deprived. But the absence of concrete universality from the whole also limits the universality of the few. Their own concrete universality therefore begins to be limited and its limitations substituted for by abstractions. This is the Hegelian process of “mediation”. The new state established after the revolution, the ideology which accompanies it, are a form of mediation between abstract and concrete, ideal and real, etc.

The mediation usually assumes the form of the state power, and the specific ideological combinations of abstract and concrete to bind the new relations are developed by the philosophy of the age. A new equilibrium in the process of the development of man has been established. At a later stage, the same developing process will be repeated in the attempt to negate the actual stage of man previously established. There will be the mass revolution for undifferentiated universality, the class differentiation in its realisation, the splitting of the nation into opposing factors, and the attempt to realise in ideology the reconciliation of the opposing factors. Man is not only what he does but what he thinks and what he aims at. But this can only be judged by the concrete, what actually takes place. The truth is always concrete. But it is the concrete viewed in the light of the whole.

In the decisive page of the preface to the [**Phenomenology**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm), Hegel writes:

“As subject it is pure and simple negativity, and just on that account a process of splitting up what is simple and undifferentiated, a process of duplicating and setting factors in opposition, which (process) in turn is the negation of this indifferent diversity and of the opposition of factors it entails. ... It is the process of its own becoming, the circle which presupposes its end as its purpose, and has its end for its beginning, it becomes concrete and actual only by being carried out, and by the end it involves.”

Marx is expressing concretely just this concentrated Hegelian generalisation when he says:

For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, put in an ideal form, it will give its ideas the form of universality and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones. The class making a revolution appears from the very start, merely because it is opposed to a class, not as a class but as the representative of the whole society; it appears as the whole mass of society confronting the one ruling class. It can do this because, to start with, its interest really is more connected with the common interest of all other non-ruling classes, because under the pressure of conditions its interest has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular class. Its victory, therefore, benefits also many individuals of other classes which are not winning a dominant position, but only in so far as it now puts these individuals in a position to raise themselves into the ruling class. ... Every new class, therefore, achieves its hegemony only on a broader basis than that of the class ruling previously, in return for which the opposition of the non-ruling class against the new ruling class later develops all the more sharply and profoundly. Both these things determine the fact that the struggle to be waged against this new ruling class, in its turn, aims at a more decided and radical negation of the previous conditions of society than could all previous classes which sought to rule. [[_German Ideology_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#2)]

This organisation of historical development did not fall from the sky. It is the result of the concept of the dialectic worked out by Hegel and without the dialectic it could not be done at all. It is this Hegel that Burnham calls the “arch-muddler” of human thought. It is from the examination of this process, the developing conflicts between abstract and concrete, subjective and objective, the abstract universal assuming a certain content which becomes concentrated in a special form, the form gradually becoming infused with a new content until it can contain it no longer and explodes, it is from the examination of all this in society and nature but particularly in its ideological reflection in philosophy that Hegel works out the significance of categories and the movement of his **Logic**. Just as Marx’s economic categories were in reality social categories, just in the same way the logical categories, contradictions, etc., of Hegel were a reflection of social categories and social movement. Hegel, and for very good reasons of his time, led his Logic into an impossible and fantastic idealism about world-spirit, etc. But the basis of his work was solidly materialistic. He himself explains that:

The community of principle which really links together individuals of the same class and in virtue of which they are similarly related to other existences, assumes a form in human consciousness; and that form is the thought or idea which summarily comprehends the constituents of generic character. Every universal in thought has a corresponding generic principle in Reality, to which it gives intellectual expression or form. (**The Philosophy of History**)

Marx and Engels knew this. They could carry over the Hegelian dialectic into a materialistic form because it had been derived originally not from religion but from a study of the stages of man in nature and society and the reflection of these stages in human thought. The dialectic of negativity, the negation of the negation, the inevitability of socialism are a culmination in logical thought of social processes that have now culminated in contemporary society. You look in vain in writings of Hook, Professor of Philosophy at New York University and Burnham, a member of the same faculty, for the slightest understanding of this.

The beginning of this process for the modern world is Christianity and the beginning “presupposes its end as its purpose”. For Hegel, these stages are the work of the universal spirit.

Marx here is his diametrical opposite. Marx is a dialectical materialist. For him, and right from the very start, these concrete revolutionary stages are the work of the great masses of the people forever seeking the concretion of universality as the development of the productive forces creates the objective circumstances and the subjective desires which move them.

Hegel could see the abstract universal, the relation between abstract and concrete in historical Christianity and the developing relation in human history. Marx saw that, but because he was closer to the end, he could see more of the “real” man. Because he had seen the revolutionary proletariat, he was able to complete the dialectical analysis of previous stages by the recognition of the role of the revolutionary masses.

These appear at the very beginning of history.

In his introduction to [**Class Struggles in France**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/index.htm), Engels writes:

“This party of revolt, of those known by the name of Christian, was also strongly represented in the army; whole legions were Christian. When they were ordered to attend the sacrificial ceremonies of the pagan established church, in order to do the honours there, the rebel soldiers had the audacity to stick peculiar emblems – a cross – on their helmets in protest. Even the wonted barrack cruelties of their superior officers were fruitless. The Emperor Diocletian could no longer quietly look on while order, obedience and discipline in his army were being undermined. He intervened energetically, while there was still time. He passed an anti-Socialist, I should say anti-Christian, law. The meetings of the rebels were forbidden, their meeting halls were closed or even pulled down, the Christian badges, crosses, etc., were like the red handkerchiefs in Saxony, prohibited. Christians were declared incapable of holding offices in the state, they were not to be allowed even to become corporals. Since there were not available at that time judges so well trained in “respect of persons” as Herr von Koller’s anti-revolt bill assumes, the Christians were forbidden out of hand to seek justice before court. This exceptional law was also without effect. The Christians tore it down from the walls with scorn; they are even supposed to have burnt the Emperor’s palace in Nicomedia over his head. Then the latter revenged himself by the great persecution of Christians in the year 303, according to our chronology. It was the last of its kind. And it was so effective that seventeen years later the army consisted overwhelmingly of Christians, and the succeeding autocrat of the whole Roman Empire, Constantine, called the Great by the priests, proclaimed Christianity as the state religion.”

The Christian revolutionaries, however, were not struggling to establish the medieval papacy. The medieval papacy was a mediation to which the ruling forces of society rallied in order to strangle the quest for universality of the Christian masses. In one sense the papacy merely continued the Roman Imperium, and, in Hobbes’s phrase, was indeed “no other than the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof”.

But it was much more than that. Primitive Christianity had begun as a mass revolt that had sought to establish the community of men upon earth. By the time of Gregory the Great, when the papacy began to take over the functions of the declined and fallen Roman Empire, the papacy was beginning its career as a combination of the Empire and the tremendous impact of the mass revolution. It was the ghost of the Roman empire and living symbol of Christ on Earth. Heaven was too abstract to satisfy completely the masses of the people. The Church guaranteed them, in return for obedience, the happy future life. But it also took care of the life on earth, and performed the functions of teacher, protector and provider for the poor and sick and needy. It mediated between society and heaven and between the secular rulers of society and the masses. It succoured the poor and was a centre of learning and the improvement of agriculture. In the method by which it was established, in its mediation, of contending classes and its manipulation of concrete abstract, the medieval papacy, as the culmination of the Christian revolution, contains in embryo all the development to the modern age. The dialectical materialist method, the product of a stage nearer to the end, is infinitely superior to Hegel’s dialectic. Constantly, contemporary events throw a penetrating light into the past and thereby illuminate the future. It is, for example, the concrete history of the last thirty years of proletarian revolutions that for the first time makes it possible to grasp fully the meaning of Renaissance. But the dialectical materialist study of the Renaissance drives the last nail in the coffin of those who hesitate before the conception of the negation of the negation, the inevitability of socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The leading ideological characteristic of the early Renaissance can be usefully designated by the popular term “humanism”. The medieval towns produced a brilliant civilisation. With the growth of wealth, chiefly a result of commercial capitalism, there arise classes of men whom the early Christian contradiction between objective and subjective, abstract and concrete, is no longer tenable. It is not merely a question of objective wealth. The idea of universality becomes more concrete because of the

“energetic position which man is sensible of occupying in his subjective power over outward and material things in the natural world, in which he feels himself free and so gains for himself an absolute right.” (Hegel, **Philosophy of History**)

The papacy is itself mediated. It became humanised, i.e. more completely secular, and thus took the road to its own ruin. St. Thomas Aquinas had already begun the rationalisaton of faith, making it reasonable by a brilliant and profound misuse of the writings of Aristotle. Dante, whom Engels calls one of the first modern men, though profoundly religious, wished to substitute Emperor for Pope. The national monarchy begins to substitute for the papal authority.

So far so good. But, and here the Marxist dialectic sharply departs from the Hegelian, the new universal was established and took its form by such violent revolutions of the European proletariat as Europe did not see again until the period which opened in 1917. It is only recently that bourgeois historians have begun to recognise these. The historians of the socialist society will in time make of this one of the great chapters of human history.

As always in critical periods, there were a series of peasant revolutions in Europe throughout the fourteenth century. They were of tremendous range and power, some of them semi-socialistic. But they were not decisive. The decisive revolutions were revolutions of the workers and the petty bourgeoisie of the towns. If the phrase had not already been appropriated by Marxists for the revolution of the socialist proletariat, it would be perfectly correct to say that within the various municipalities the workers aimed at, consciously, and in some few cases actually achieved, the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the last half of the fourteenth century, these revolutions swept from one end of Europe to another.

In Salonika, the sailors and the artisans ruled the rich, the landowners, the commercial magnates and the clergy for ten years. In Italy, the struggle between the “fat” and the “thin”. In Bologna, in Genoa, in Sienna, the masses sought to obtain absolute mastery of municipal power. In Florence, under the leadership of Michel Lando, they organised the celebrated revolt of the Ciompi and established the dictatorship of the proletariat whom they called “God’s people”.

Rome and other towns saw similar battles. But it was in the Lowlands, in towns of Ghent, Ypres, and Bruges that the workers made the most desperate efforts to establish their own dictatorship. Revolutionary history badly needs a study of the incidents which centre around the van Artevelde family. Over and over again during a period of decades, the workers rose. More than once they established their dictatorship, they proclaimed an equality of fortunes and the suppression of all authority except the authority of people who live by manual labour. They repeatedly defeated the flower of feudal chivalry. It is reported that in Ghent, the workers went so far as to plan the complete extermination of the bourgeoisie and the nobles with the exception of children of six years of age. In the German towns of Cologne, Strasbourg, Aix-la-Chapelle, Lubeck, Stettin and many others, in Barcelona, Valencia, and the other towns in Spain, the same desperate battles took place.

The working class and its allies closest to it fought for fifty years all over Europe to establish proletarian democracy. Why they failed to achieve substantial successes was due not only to the low level of production but the fact that they fought only as members of isolated municipalities. Some of them indeed aimed boldly at an international proletarian revolution. But their time was not yet.

Let Boissonade, a bourgeois historian, speak in the concluding paragraph of his **Life and Work in Medieval Europe**. The reader should read carefully and note particularly the words we have underlined [<3m>Proofreader’s Note: In the current version these underlinings are missing.]:

For the first time the masses, ceasing to be mere herds without rights or thoughts of their own, became associations of freemen, proud of their independence, conscious of the value and dignity of their labour, fitted by their intelligent activity to collaborate in all spheres, political, economic, and social, in the tasks which the aristocrats believed themselves alone able to fulfil. Not only was the power of production multiplied a hundredfold by their efforts, but society was regenerated by the incessant influx of new and vigorous blood. Social selection was henceforth better assured. It was thanks to the devotion and spirit of these medieval masses that the nations became conscious of themselves, for it was they who brought about the triumph of national patriotism, just as their local patriotism had burned for town or village in the past. The martyrdom of a peasant girl from the marshes of Lorraine saved the first of the great nations, France, which had become the most brilliant home of civilisation in the Middle Ages. They gave to the modern states their first armies, which were superior to those of feudal chivalry. Above all, it was they who prepared the advent of democracy and bequeathed to the labouring masses the instruments of their power, the principles of freedom and of association. Labour, of old despised and depreciated, became a power of incomparable force in the world, and its social value became increasingly recognised. It is from the Middle Ages that this capital evolution takes its date, and it is this which makes this period, so often misunderstood, and so full of a confused but singularly powerful activity, the most important in the universal history of the labour before the great changes witnessed by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

This was the working class five hundred years ago. They were not proletarians in the modern sense. They were, for the most part, free workers in the guilds. They did not function within the socialised organisation of modern labour. But note, Messrs. anti-dialecticians and anti-Marxists, that these workers, five hundred years ago, all over Europe, believed that they were “fitted by their intelligent activity to collaborate in all spheres, political, economic and social in the tasks which the aristocrats believed themselves alone able to fulfil”. That is what the millions of proletarians all over the world today believe. They will fight for it. We believe they will succeed. You believe what? Their ancestors of five hundred years ago were not as developed as are the workers of today. But they fought for complete equality, for complete democracy, for universality. They failed, but they established the foundations of what we know as liberalism. Some of you still live on it, thin fare though it has become. The bourgeoisie had the feudal lords, in terror of these workers, rallied behind the absolute monarchy and the national state. Both humanism and the national state of the absolute monarchy were mediations of the mass proletarian desire for universality no longer in heaven but on earth. Humanism was the substitution of a liberal culture for the rich in place of the complete self-expression desired by the workers; the national state, disciplining the church, supplemented the concrete objective protection of wealth by abstract subjective claims of being the arbiter of justice, the guardian of law and order, and the protector of all the people. The contradictions, the antagonisms in the quest for universality had grown sharper than ever.

So, Messrs. doubters and sceptics and sneerers at dialectic, you will begin to see perhaps that what dialecticians believe in is not the result of religion. We have a certain conception of the nature of man based on history. When Marx and Engels wrote about the proletarian revolution in connection with the negation of the negation, when they wrote that in the present stage of society, man would either achieve this revolution or society would tear itself to pieces, they were being guided not by the dislocations of Marx’s “psyche” as Edmund Wilson thinks or by any Hegelian triads or historical religiosity, as is the opinion of Burnham and Hook. It was a logical deduction from the experience of history. The struggle of the masses for universality did not begin yesterday. An intellectual like Dewey believes that men’s quest is the quest for certainty. The intellectual believes that all men are intellectuals. That is wrong. Men seek not intellectual certainty. The quest is the mass quest for universality in action and in life. It is the moving force of history. And history has reached a climax because this quest has reached a climax.

Space compels rapid compression of the next great stages in the process of social development – the Protestant reformation and the French revolution. Rising capitalism expropriated the agricultural labourer and in the creation of wage-labour threw the masses further back from universality than they had ever been. Humanism had dragged universality from heaven down to earth and had by that made the contradiction between real and ideal an intolerable antagonism. The new proletariat could not play any great part in the struggles of the Protestant reformation, as the mature workers of the medieval towns had done. Hence the classes which took the lead were the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie and the peasants. Let us concentrate on one outstanding and familiar example, the English revolution.

The Puritans give us the key to the understanding of the whole period in the light of the struggle for democracy. The revolution of Dewey had shattered forever the claims of the Pope as mediator between God and man. It placed the responsibility for the individual’s moral salvation squarely on the individual man. As Hegel put it:

“This is the essence of the Reformation: Man is in his very nature destined to be free”, and in his own peculiar but profound manner he sums up modern history. “Time, since that epoch, has had no other work to do than the formal imbuing of the world with this principle, in bringing the Reconciliation implicit (in Christianity) into objective and explicit realisation.”

If you stand it on its head, and say that the objective development of man in society has been the various stages through which various classes have sought to realise the freedom implicit in Christianity, a great truth will have been grasped.

But the mass of men do not think, and certainly do not act according to those terms. The Puritans of town and country, petty-bourgeois, and semi-proletarian, shut off from freedom by the state, attempted to establish democracy in religion. The sects each attempted to form a social community in which the individual would exercise the new freedom, unlimited except by the equal freedom of other men. James I of England did not misunderstand them one bit. He knew what their anti-Ecclesiasticism meant. To all their arguments for religious freedom he invariably croaked in reply, “No Bishop, no King.” Their weakness was a social weakness, the lack of organisation which reflected the scattered character of their labour. But when the big bourgeoisie and some liberal aristocrats started the revolution, and the small farmers and small masters of the towns organised in the army, the Puritans showed what social passions were hidden behind their psalm-singing. In 1646, tired of the vacillations of their bourgeois and aristocratic leaders, they seized the person of the King and held him as a hostage. They then began negotiations with Cromwell and in the twin documents, the agreement of the People and the Heads of the Proposals, they put forward a programme for such a parliamentary democracy as was not even put forward in England until the Chartist movement two hundred years later. They put it forward to Cromwell; and in the discussion with Cromwell and his brother-in-law, Ireton, they raised the property question as a barrier to democracy in the most plain-spoken manner. These were not the Levellers, and the Diggers, who were the extreme left. These were the main body of the army. They were suppressed by a combination of fraud and force, but Cromwell, striking to the left, was compelled to strike at the right also. Charles I was executed and the monarchy was destroyed. In the familiar phrase, it was not monarchy but royalty which returned at the restoration. Monarchy in Britain was gone forever, destroyed by the religious democrats. They held power for eleven years, but as always, and particularly in this case, they were too few to represent the nation and the old process of mediation once more took place. They had cleared the way for capitalism, and nowhere was the antagonism sharper between developing capitalism and the masses of the nation than in England.

The history of the French revolution is familiar to all Marxists and the conclusions for our main argument are therefore easy to draw.

The intervention of the masses, its range and power, the social desires, the capacity for achievement and sacrifice, revealed itself to an educated Europe which had not dreamt that the shabby exterior of workers and peasants and the common people hid such colossal energies and such social needs. The quest for universality was no longer a secret. Liberty, equality and fraternity were the slogans of the revolution. If the Reformation had sought to establish a “democratic” freedom of religion, the French revolution attempted to establish a social freedom of political democracy. If out of the individual’s responsibility for his own salvation, there had leapt democracy, out of his political freedom, there leapt communism. Robespierre’s dictatorship was an attempt to establish the reign of virtue. But the French masses, not only Babeuf, saw and were ready for what was needed, drastic regulation and even confiscation of the property of the rich. The modern problem was posed. But it was the old problem in a new and more aggravated, a more contradictory form.

When the French revolution was over and men had time to think, it was seen that the revolution of reason and the mighty struggle for liberty, equality and fraternity had left men farther apart than ever before. Behind the formal equality before the law, capitalist production was accumulating wealth at one pole and misery, subordination and degradation at the other on a scale hitherto unknown. The universality of men, honour, loyalty, humanism, liberty, equality, fraternity, democracy, these were as abstract to the mass of men as the heaven of the early Popes. These ideals had a certain existence among the ruling classes, but thinking man could see that the needs and deprivations of the excluded mass reached with devastating effect upon the humanity of the rulers. The masses had tried to make a state a popular state. The result had been the creation of a monster such as had never been seen before and far surpassed in range and power the state of absolute monarchy. It was in the throes of this contradiction which was shaking all Europe that Hegel, the culmination of the German classical philosophers, set himself to study the problem of human destiny and elaborated a theory of knowledge. Hegel recognised what men were striving for and he recognised that the French revolution was a climax in this struggle.

Hegel understood Adam Smith and Ricardo. He understood the fragmentation and dehumanisation of man in the process of capitalist production. Many of Marx’s most famous pages in Capital have as their direct origins some of Hegel’s descriptions of the workers in capitalist industry. This was, for Hegel, the final insuperable barrier to any community of association among men. Hence universality for the mass of men was impossible. By means of his dialectical method he drew the necessary conclusions. We who live toward the end in the epoch of Hitler and Stalin can understand Hegel’s conclusions better than most men of previous generations, with the exception of Marx.

Universality for the mass of men was impossible. Only the state, said Hegel, could embody universality for the community. But, in particular, the state was a defence against the revolutionary masses.

Hegel had seen them and their activities in European history and now the French Revolution had shown that nothing could ever come of it. So it had been and it would ever be. At each stage, a few chosen individuals represented the abstract spirit of mankind. Universality had to be restricted to these. This was the basis of Hegel’s idealism. But with the clear insight of a great scholar of both past and contemporary history, and by his mastery of his method, he analysed and drew his analysis to its conclusion. The state would have to organise production. The chaos of capitalist production would have to be disciplined by organising the separate industries into corporations. The state would be the state of the corporations. Universality being impossible to all men, the state bureaucracy would embody universality and represent the community. Hegel did not know the modern proletariat. He operated therefore on the basis of the inevitability of proletarian subordination. But grant him that premise and his dialectical method shows that he made an astonishing anticipation in thought of the inevitable end of bourgeois society – the totalitarian state. Hegel must not be misjudged. He wrote and propounded in the name of freedom and Reason. But those who today sneer at him and his dialectics are not fit even to wipe the dust off his books. To this day, except for the writings of the great Marxists, no single writer since the French revolution has so much to say that is indispensable to modern thought and particularly modern politics.

This is where Marx began. It was as impossible to go any farther along the road of Hegel as it is impossible to go farther than the totalitarian state of contemporary history. Beyond both lies only decay.

Marx had to abandon the quest for universality or find a new basis for it.

A long line of European thinkers, Ricardo, Fourier, Saint-Simon, Feuerbach, and the classical economists, the ferment in Europe which preceded the revolutionary outburst in 1848, and, what Hegel had never seen, the emergence of the proletariat as an organised social force – these gave to Marx, already a master of Hegel’s system, the impetus to the new system.

Men had sought universality in heaven, in the freedom of religion, in the freedom of politics. Politics had failed. Neither Hegel nor Marx ever had any illusions about bourgeois democracy as a solution to the unquenchable desires and aspirations of men.

Nothing is more indicative of the philosophical character of Marxism and its organic continuity of the tradition of the great philosophers of Europe than the method by which Marx dismissed democratic politics. For Marx bourgeois democratic politics was a fraud, but like all the great panaceas from Christianity on, it was an expression of the perennial need historically conditioned. The productive process of capitalism denied any real community to men. And democratic politics, like religion, was a form of mediation by which men gained the illusion that they were all members of one social community, an illusion of universality. How not to remember Hitler’s insistence that his tyrannical regime represented the folk community. The more the Nazi regime deprived the masses of all human rights, the more imperative it was to substitute an abstraction of abstractions to create the totality of existence, a sense of universality, without which men cannot live.

Marx reversed Hegel at all points. It was not an intellectual construction. Men were doing it and had been doing it all around him for years.

Hegel saw objective history as the successive manifestation of a world spirit. Marx placed the objective movement in the process of production. Hegel had been driven to see the perpetual quest for universality as necessarily confined to the process of knowledge. Marx reversed this and rooted the quest for universality in the need for the free and full development of all the inherent and acquired characteristics of the individual in productive and intellectual labour. Hegel had made the motive force of history the work of a few gifted individuals in whom was concentrated the social movement. Marx propounded the view that it was only when the ideas seized hold of the masses that the process of history moved. Hegel dreaded the revolt of the modern mass. Marx made the modern proletarian revolution the motive force of modern history.

Hegel placed the future guardianship of society in the hands of the bureaucracy. Marx saw future society as headed for ruin except under the rulership of the proletariat and the vanishing distinction between intellectual and manual labour.

That was the conflict. That is the conflict today. The proletariat, said Marx, is revolutionary or it is nothing. The proletariat, he said, will conquer or society will destroy itself. The bureaucracy as conceived by Hegel he subjected to a merciless analysis. Let the reader think of Hitlerite Germany and Stalinist Russia and see how profound, how realistic, how anticipatory of the absolute crisis was the battle between the last of the great bourgeois philosophers and the first philosopher of the proletarian revolution. The smug anti-dialecticians have not yet caught up with this conflict between the masters of dialectic over a hundred years ago.

Hegel’s conception of history is nothing other than the speculative expression of the Christian-German dogma of the opposition of spirit and manner, God and the world. This opposition expresses itself within history, within the human world itself, as a few chosen individuals, active spirits, confronting the rest of humanity, the spiritless mass matter. Hegel’s conception of history presupposes an abstract or absolute spirit which develops itself so that humanity is only a mass bearing this spirit unconsciously or consciously. Within the empirical exoteric history, he sees a speculative esoteric history. The history of mankind is transformed into the history of the abstract spirit of mankind, beyond actual men.

Parallel with this Hegelian doctrine, there was developed in France the theory of the doctrinaires proclaiming the sovereignty of reason in opposition to the sovereignty of the people, in order to exclude the masses and rule alone. The result is that if the activity of the actual masses is nothing more than the activity of a mass of human individuals, the abstract universality, reason, spirit, possesses abstract expression exhausted in a few individuals. It depends upon the position and the strength of imagination of each individual whether he will pass as representative of “spirit”.(Marx, [**The Holy Family**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm))

Hegel had observed the unconscious development of the process of mediation. The bureaucracy of his corporate state was a conscious final mediation. Marx, in the [_Critique of Hegel’s **Philosophy of Right**_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/index.htm) took up the challenge. The passage which follows might have been strange or difficult twenty years ago, not today. The reader must remember that both Hegel and Marx had common pre-suppositions – the recognition of the quest for universality, the recognition that the French revolution had brought the perpetual mediation of the growing contradictions to some final stage. The essence of the passage is that while Hegel believed that the bureaucracy can and must be a mediation for universality, Marx shows that the contradiction between objective and subjective, between ideal and real, concrete and abstract, has now reached such a stage, that the universality of the bureaucracy can have no reality. The quest for universality, embodied in the masses, constituting the great mass of the nation, forbids any mediation. The bureaucracy is compelled to become objectively the embodiment of the crassest materialism and subjectively, in its words, the embodiment of the crassest hypocrisy.

Here is the passage with certain words emphasised:

The _state formalism_ which the bureaucracy is, is the _state as formalism_ and as such formalism Hegel has described it. Since this _state formalism_ is constituted as actual power and its own material content becomes itself, it is self-understood that the _bureaucracy_ is a network of practical illusions or the _illusion of the state_. The bureaucratic spirit is a thoroughly Jesuitical theological spirit. The bureaucrats are the Jesuits and theologians of the state. The bureaucracy is the _republique prêtre_. [_Critique of Hegel’s **Philosophy of Right**_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/ch03.htm#026)

Since the bureaucracy is essentially the _state as formalism_, it is this also in its purpose. Thus the actual purpose of the state appears to the bureaucracy as a purpose against the state. The spirit of the bureaucracy is the _formal spirit of the state_. It makes therefore the _formal spirit of the state_ or the actual emptiness of spirit of the state into a categorical imperative. The bureaucracy thus is driven to the final end and purpose of the state. Since the bureaucracy makes its _formal_ purpose into its content, it gets into conflicts everywhere with the _real_ purposes. It is therefore necessary to substitute the form for the content, the content for the form. The purposes of the state are transformed into administrative ones or the administrative purpose into state purposes. The bureaucracy is a circle out of which no one can get. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge. The apex entrusts to the lower circles insight into particular things, and the lower circles entrust to the apex insights into the universal and thus they mutually interchange.

The bureaucracy is the imaginary state besides the real state, the spiritualism of the state. Everything therefore has a double meaning, a real one and a bureaucratic one, as knowledge is double, real knowledge and bureaucratic (also the will). The real essence is handled according to its bureaucratic essence, according to its other worldly spiritual essence. The bureaucracy has the essence of the state, the spiritual essence of society in its possession, it is its private property. The general spirit of the bureaucracy is the secret, the mystery, guarded internally through the hierarchy, externally as the closed corporation. The apparent spirit of the state, the opinion of the state, appears therefore to the bureaucracy as a treason to its mysteries. Authority is therefore the principle of its knowledge, and deifying of authority is its principle. Within itself, however, spiritualism becomes a crass materialism, the materialism of passive obedience, of belief in authority, the mechanism of fixed formal behaviour, fixed principles, observations, traditions. As for the individual bureaucrat, the purpose of the state becomes a private purpose, a hunt for higher posts, for careers. First, he regards real life as material, for the spirit of this life has its exclusive existence in the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy must therefore proceed to make living as material as possible. Secondly, it is material for itself, i.e. so far as it becomes an object of bureaucratic handling, for its spirit is prescribed to it, its purpose lies outside of it, its existence is the existence of administration. The state exists henceforth only as fixed spirits of various offices, whose connection is subordination and passive obedience. Actual science appears as without content, actual life is as dead, for the imaginary knowing and imaginary living pass as the essence. The bureaucrat must therefore believe Jesuitically with the actual state, be this Jesuitism now conscious, or unconscious. It is, however, necessary that as soon as his opposite is knowing, he also achieve self-consciousness and purposeful Jesuitism.

That is the political anatomy of the Stalinist bureaucracy. In the review _After Ten Years_, I could touch only briefly (such are the trials of political minorities) upon the dehumanisation of the Russian bureaucracy itself. The Russian bureaucracy, as the Nazi bureaucracy in its time, represents essentially the opposition to the universality of the people in every single sphere of life. As the same article says:

In socialist society or in a society transitional to socialism, politics, science, art, literature, education all become truly social. The individual is able to exercise his gifts to the highest capacity, to become truly universal, because of the essentially collective life of the society in which he lives. Look at Stalinist society. No individual is more “political” than the individual in Stalinist society.

Nowhere are art, literature, education, science, so integrated with “society”. This is the appearance. In reality, never before has there been such a prostitution of all these things for the corruption and suppression of the direct producer, with the resulting degradation of the producers and managers alike.

Hitler called his state the truest democracy, his community was the folk community of the whole nation. His regime was “socialism”. The Stalinist regime goes farther. The state possesses all the virtues.

The internationalist conception of the human welfare is maintained through the connection with the corrupt and depraved communist parties and the constant appeal to the masses of the world. The state guarantees a “genuine” democracy, a “genuine” freedom of speech. Science, art and literature, like production, exist only to serve all the people. The state only administers the property which is the possession of all the people. Liberty, equality (within reason) and fraternity, honour, loyalty, chivalry, geniality, are the possession of all the people (except the Trotskyists). The leader is the leader because he possesses all these qualities to a superlative degree. Any oppositionist to the slightest of these claims becomes immediately an enemy devoid of all these virtues and fit only for extermination. The totality of the abstraction is to be explained only by the totality of the deprivation. Today this state is not only confined to Russia as an isolated phenomenon. It is spreading. Trotsky taught that the growth of the Stalinist state was due to the struggle over consumption. We cannot accept this at all. The Stalinist state is the completest expression of the class state – not the distorted beginning of something new but the culmination, the final form of the old. To believe that this state has roots only in consumption and not in the whole productive system is to saddle the concepts of Marxian socialism with a burden which they cannot indefinitely carry. The Stalinist state is a class state, a culmination of the old, not in any shape or form the beginning, however distorted, of the new.

Of precisely the same genre are the abstractions of the bourgeois democracies, different not in quality but only in the degree. Phrases like the “century of the common man” and the “four freedoms” are abstractions to satisfy the suppression of objective needs. The League of Nations of 1919 becomes the United Nations of 1947. The more concrete the negation of the need, the more abstract, empty and flamboyant becomes the subjective mediation.

There is a school of Marxists today who preach the ridiculous doctrine that in Russia today politics governs production. In reality, production governs politics. In appearance, the state takes hold of capital. In reality, capital takes hold of the state, and upon the mediation of the antagonisms of social and political life is superimposed and the antagonisms of capitalist production itself. In its most developed form, it is state capital.

It is this modern state, the negation of universality for so many millions, which is to be negated. The negation of this is the negation of the negation. The agent of this negation is the revolutionary proletariat. When the modern millions take hold of this state, they negate the root of their degradation, production itself, for to control the state of state capitalism is to control production itself. At this moment, the state begins to wither away.

I can sum up best by a quotation from an article I wrote in _New International_ of June 1944:

But the outstanding feature of the contemporary world is that the principles for which Christianity stood in its best days are now regarded as matters of life and death by the average worker. This is no accident at all though we can only state the facts here. European civilisation must become a unity? Hundreds of millions of European workers know that this must be achieved or the continent will perish. Equality of nations? That, too, the great masses of Europe passionately desire, not as an ideal but to be able to live in peace. A central government to represent the interests of all? As late as 1935, Lord Cecil could get eleven million votes in a plebiscite in Britain supporting the idea of a League of Nations. And when workers say a League of Nations and collective security they mean it. And that early attempt to succour the poor, to help the afflicted, to teach the ignorant? The great mass of the workers in European countries conceive of Labour Parties as doing just that, within the conditions of the modern world.

Our anti-dialecticians believe the negation of negation and the inevitability of socialism are religion. But when one attempts to penetrate into their philosophy of history, one increasingly meets a vacuum or the most arbitrary combinations of historical phenomena, tied together by bits of string, by subjective analysis and a crude determinism which even sometimes has the presumption to call itself Marxism. For us there is no philosophy of history without Marxism, and there can be no Marxism without the dialectic. In the article quoted above, I continued:

He who would exhibit the Marxist method must grasp the full significance of that early uprising of the masses when Christianity proclaimed its message. We must watch not only the primitiveness and simplicity of its aims but their comprehensive scope. Then by slow degrees, through the centuries, we see one part of the aim becoming concrete for one section of the population, and then another part for another section. Ideas arise from concrete conditions to become partially embodied in social classes and give rise to further interrelations between the spiral of real and ideal, content and form. This is the dialectic to which Marx gave a firm materialistic basis in the developing process of production. As society develops, the possibilities for individual development of man become greater and greater, but the conflict of classes becomes sharper and sharper. We stand today at an extreme state of these interrelated phenomena of social development. When a modern worker demands the right of free speech, the right of free press, of free assembly, continuous employment, social insurance, the best medical attention, the best education, he demands in reality the “social republic”. Spinoza and Kant would stand aghast at what the average worker takes for granted today. But he does not demand them as an individual or in the primitive manner the early Christian did. In America, for instance, there are some thirteen million workers organised for nothing else but the preservation and extension of these values. These are the values of modern civilisation. They are embodied in the very web and texture of the lives of the masses of the people. Never were such precious values so resolutely held as necessary to complete living by so substantial and so powerful a section of society. Socialism means simply the complete expansion and fulfillment of these values in the life of the individual. This can only be attained by the most merciless struggle of the whole class against its capitalist masters. The realisation of this necessity is the final prelude to full self-consciousness.

You still believe, gentlemen, that these ideas and conclusions are the result of a dialectical religion? Go your way. God be with you. Amen.

Bolshevism is above all a philosophy of life and a political conception. The political conception is the organised preparation for the proletarian revolution. Lenin was the originator of Bolshevism, the Marxism of our time. The world was to be saved by reason, but reason lay not in the heads of philosophers and intellectuals but in the actions of the masses. The world as we know it, under the control of its present masters, is unreasonable, chaotic, lacking in energy and creative force, gangrenous, barbarism. For Lenin, reason, order, historical creativeness, lay precisely in the forces which would destroy the old world. This is how he saw the councils of the workers, the soviets, and the revolutionary actions of the masses in 1905:

The old power, as a dictatorship of the minority, could maintain itself only by the aid of police stratagems, only by preventing and diverting the masses from participating in the government, from controlling the government. The old power persistently distrusted the masses, feared the light, maintained itself by means of deception. The new power, as a dictatorship of the overwhelming majority, could and did maintain itself only by winning the confidence of the great masses, only by drawing, in the freest, broadest, and most energetic manner, all the masses into the work of government. Nothing hidden, nothing secret, no regulations, no formalities. You are a working man? You wish to fight to liberate Russia from a handful of police thugs? Then you are our comrade. Choose your delegate at once, immediately. Choose as you think best. We shall willingly and gladly accept him as a full member of our Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, of our Peasants’ Committee, of our Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies, etc., etc. It is a power that is open to all, that does everything in sight of the masses, that is accessible to the masses, that springs directly from the masses; it is the direct organ of the masses and their will. Such was the new power, or rather its embryo, for the victory of the old power very soon trampled upon the tender shoots of this new plant. (**Selected Works**, vol. VII, pp. 252–3)

There are innumerable people opposed to bourgeois society, as they think, but who fear the uprising of the proletarian masses from that passive obedience, which is precisely the basis of bourgeois society. They want socialism but want to be sure of order, system, reason. Lenin had a different conception of where order was to be sought:

When the history of humanity moves forward at the speed of a locomotive (the petty-bourgeois intellectual) calls it a “whirlwind”, a “deluge”, the “disappearance” of all “principles and ideas”. When history moves at the speed of a horse and cart he calls it reason, system. Then the masses themselves, with all their virgin primitiveness, their simple, rough determination, begin to make history to apply “principles and theories” directly and immediately, the bourgeoisie takes fright and wails that “reason is thrust into the background”. (Is not the very opposite the case, you philistine heroes? Is it not precisely in such moments of history that the reason of the masses is displayed rather than the reason of single individuals? Is it not precisely at such times that reason of the masses becomes a living, active force, and not an armchair force?) When direct action by the masses is crushed by shootings, executions, floggings, unemployment and famine, when the bugs of professorial science, subsidised by Dubasov, crawl out of the cracks and begin to speak on behalf of the people, in the name of the masses, and sell and betray the interests of the latter to a privileged few – the knights of philistinism imagine that an epoch of peace and calm progress has set in, that “the turn of sense and reason has now come again. (Lenin, **Selected Works**, vol. VII, pp. 260–1)

The bourgeois world is rejected completely. Only what destroys it is reasonable. But the reason of the masses was not merely destructive. It was destructive of the bourgeois world. But it was itself a “mighty creative force”.

The point is that it is precisely the revolutionary periods that are distinguished for their greater breadth, greater wealth, greater intelligence, greater and more systematic activity, greater audacity and vividness of historical creativeness compared with periods of philistine, Cadet, reformist progress. But Mr Blank and Co. picture it the other way about. They pass off poverty as historical-creative wealth. They regard the inactivity of the suppressed, downtrodden masses as the triumph of the systematic activity of the bureaucrats and the bourgeoisie. They shout about the disappearance of sense and reason, when the picking to pieces of parliamentary bills by all sorts of bureaucrats and liberal “penny-a-liners” gives way to a period of direct political activity by the “common people”, who in their simple way directly and immediately destroy the organs of oppression of the people, seize power, appropriate for themselves what was considered to be the property of all sorts of plunderers of the people in a word, precisely when the sense and reason of millions of downtrodden people is awakening, not only for reading books, but for action, for living human action, for historical creativeness. (Lenin, **Selected Works**, vol. VII, pp. 261–2)

This is creative reason during the revolution and this is creative reason after the revolution. Readers of the following articles in this pamphlet and of the documents of our tendency will know that for us the economic planning of the new society must be the result of the same creativeness and energy of the masses expressed through their soviets, their councils, their party or parties. As we have shown in our pamphlet this was Lenin’s conception. For us therefore, once the masses in Russia were totally subordinated to the bureaucracy, then capital as an economic force resumed sway, and objective economic law reasserted itself. The proletarians of the fourteenth century failed, but the masses today begin from a society in which the socialisation of the labour process is the dominant feature of the economy. The education, the training, the discipline, the social awareness, the material and spiritual needs of the great millions have reached astonishing proportions. These are the new economic forces. They are worldwide. If the earlier revolutions were outstanding peaks in a world in which the periphery was large, backward and stagnant, it is not so today. Disparate as are the economic levels of the United States and China, the world is today one system and a social unit. The need for universality of the individual man is only part of the need for universality in the world at large;

“only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ’propertyless’ mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones.”

Thus Marx in [**The German Ideology**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/index.htm), in 1846. Today we are at the end.

It would be a grave mistake not to attempt to show, however briefly, the theoretical link between these concepts and the practical activity of building a revolutionary organisation. The dialectician is often seriously thrown back by the fact that the great masses of the workers do not seem to think in a way that corresponds to these ideas. He should remember that the number who thought of socialist revolution in Russia in February 1917 was pitifully few. There was not one single republican in France on 14 July 1789. How many of the Founding Fathers advocated independence in 1776? The anticipations of these ideas accumulate and then under suitable conditions explode into a new quality.

But with the masses the matter goes even deeper. They do not think as intellectuals do and this intellectuals must understand. In one of his most remarkable pages Lenin confesses that at a critical moment of the Russian revolution he was performing the most critical of all tasks, evaluating the events of July in order to change the policy and organisation of the Bolshevik Party. He was living with a working-class family. The hostess placed bread on the table. “Look,” says the host, “what fine bread. ‘They’ dare not give us bad bread now. And we had almost forgotten that good bread could be had in Petrograd.” Let Lenin himself continue:

I was amazed at this class evaluation of the July days. My mind had been revolving around the political significance of the event, weighing its importance in relation to the general course of events, analysing the situation that had given rise to this zigzag of history and the situation it would create. And debating how we must alter our slogans and party apparatus in order to adapt them to the changed situation. As for bread, I, who had never experienced want, never gave it a thought. Bread to me seemed a matter of course, a by-product, as it were, of the work of a writer. Fundamentally, the mind approaches the class struggle for bread by a political analysis and an extraordinarily complicated and involved path.

But this representative of the oppressed class, although one of the better-paid and well-educated workers, took the bull by the horns with that astonishing simplicity and bluntness, with that firm resolution and amazingly clear insight, which is as remote from your intellectual as the stars in the sky. (Lenin, **Selected Works**, vol. VI, pp. 280–81)

The key phrase in this passage is “although one of the better-paid and well-educated workers”. Better paid and well-educated workers are very often corrupted by bourgeois education. It is the great millions, very often unorganised in unions but “disciplined, and united and organised by the very mechanism of capitalist production” itself that constitute the most heroic, the most self-sacrificing battalions of the new social order. They do not approach great questions by a complicated and involved path “as intellectuals do. Their most effective method of expression is action, corresponding to the astonishing simplicity, bluntness ... firm resolution and amazingly clear insight” of their speech when they do speak. For long years they appear entirely subordinated to bourgeois ideas and the place bourgeois society has reserved for them. But they have their own ideas and in the continuous crisis and catastrophic decline of society, they have in recent decades repeatedly entered upon the field of history with world-shaking effects. Since 1917, no lasting victory has been theirs but the future is with them or there is no future.

Revolutionary politics consists of a conscious relating of the needs of the objective situation to the state of development of the masses. But decisive always is the objective situation, the world of today, and a superficial conception of the stage of development of the masses can be a terrible trap for the unwary. The objective conditions of our world demand universal solutions. It is absolutely impossible to propose a proletarian programme to counter the imperialism of the “Marshall Plan” without counterposing an international plan of socialist economic construction. That is the world in which we live.

In Europe, adequate wages, stable prices, food, housing and heating are no longer partial questions. Any reasonable satisfaction of the needs of the people demands a total reorganisation of the economy, a plan for continental rehabilitation, and close association with the economic power of the United States. Peace is indivisible. The need for universality stretches out from the hearth to the whole world.

But the same need exists intensively. It is the crime of capitalism that it uses men only partially. Labour bureaucracies which call on men only for votes or sending telegrams, are only partially mobilising vast stores of creative energy which are crying for release. Bankrupt economies which cannot mobilise the universal contained in modern man are doomed to remain bankrupt. That and nothing else but that can rebuild the vast wreck which is the modern world. Objectively and subjectively the solution of the crisis demands a total mobilisation of all forces in society. Partial solutions only create further disorders in the economy; partial demands, as such, because they are abstractions from the reality, lead only to disappointment; partial demands by leaders on the workers fail to mobilise their energies and leave them with a sense of frustration and hopelessness. Thus not only the concept but the need for universality reigns throughout all phases of society.

This was the constant theme of Trotsky before he was murdered in 1940. In previous periods the socialists fought for partial demands and held before the masses the social revolution as a distant goal. Today those days are over. The revolutionaries hold always before the masses the concept of the proletarian revolution but do not neglect to snatch this and that partial demand to better the position of the toilers and mobilise them for the final struggle.

This only is reason. The modern intellectual, once he breaks with bourgeois conceptions, finds a vast new world of ideas open before him. But he can pursue and present these ideas in their inner essence only with the inevitable universality of the revolutionary proletariat in mind. Without this there is no dialectic, and without dialectic, thought soon bogs down in the chaotic disintegration of the modern world. Quite different is it with the dialectical materialist. In his boldest flights, he is conscious that he will not exceed the real history of humanity which is being prepared by the revolutionary masses.

# From the Master-Slave Dialectic  
to Revolt in Capitalist Production

### (January 1946)

In **The Phenomenology of Mind** (one of the three basic books used by Lenin in his studies for **Imperialism**), in the section on Lordship and Bondage, Hegel shows that the lord has a desire for the object and enjoys it. But because he does not actually work on it, his desire lacks objectivity. The labor of the bondman, in working, in changing, i.e. in negating the raw material, has the contrary effect. This, his _labor_, gives him his rudimentary sense of personality. Marx hailed this and continued the basic idea in his analysis of handicraft and the early stages of capitalist production (simple co-operation). The laborer's physical and mental faculties are developed by the fact that he makes a whole chair, a whole table, a piece of armor, or a whole shoe.

With the development of the stage of manufacture, however, there begins the division of labor, and here instead of making one object, man begins to produce fragments of an object. _In the process of production_, there begins stultification, distortion, and ossification of his physical and intellectual faculties.

With the productive process of heavy industry, this stultification is pushed to its ultimate limit. Man becomes merely an appendage to a machine. He no longer uses the instruments of production. As Marx repeats on page after page, the instruments of production use him. Hegel, who had caught hold of this, was completely baffled by it and, seeing no way out, took refuge in idealism. Marx, using the Hegelian method and remaining in the productive process itself, discovered and elaborated one of the most profound truths of social and political psychology. In the very degradation of the workers he saw the basis of their emancipation. Attacking Proudhon in **The Poverty of Philosophy** (1847) for misunderstanding dialectic, he wrote of the laborer in the automatic factory: “But from the moment that all special development ceases, the need of universality, the tendency towards an integral development of the individual, begins to make itself felt.” This need of the individual for universality, for a sense of integration so powerful among all modern oppressed classes, is the key to vast areas of social and political jungles of today. The fascists, for example, understood it thoroughly.

Twenty years later, in **Capital**, Marx developed the political results of the argument in full.

#8220;It is as a result of the division of labor in manufactures, that the laborer is brought face to face with the intellectual potencies of the material process of production as the property of another and as a ruling power.” He does not need revolutionary parties to teach him this. [The labor process] is his revolutionary education. It begins in manufacture. “It is complete in modern industry ...”

This is the misery that is accumulated as capital is accumulated. It may not be formulated. But the moment bourgeois society breaks down and the worker breaks out in insurrection, for whatever incidental purpose, resentment against the whole system explodes with terrible power.

The babblers who think that all the American workers want is “full employment” are in for a rude awakening. That capitalism increases the use-values (radio, education, books, etc) that he uses outside of production only increases his antagonism.

The educational process is not individual but social. As Marx insisted and Lenin never wearied in pointing out, in addition to this personal, individual education, capital educates the worker socially and politically. In **Capital**, Marx quoted a passage he had written twenty years before in the **Manifesto**. Former systems, all of them, aimed at conservation of the existing mode of production. Far different is capital:

“Constant revolution in production, uninterrupted disturbances of all social conditions, ever-lasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen prejudices, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away, all new formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.”

The very climax of Marx's chapter on _The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation_ is the warning that “This antagonistic character of capitalist accumulation is enunciated in varied forms by political economists, although by them it is confounded with phenomena, certainly to some extent analogous but nevertheless essentially distinct and belonging to pre-capitalist modes of production,” i.e. the Middle Ages. And why essentially distinct?

Because in capital alone the degradation and its historical conditions also create in the workers the determination to overthrow the system and acquire for themselves the intellectual potencies of the material process of production.

The dialectics of the Abstract & the Concrete in Marx’s Capital  
Chapter 4 – Logical Development and Concrete Historicism

### On the Difference Between the Logical and the Historical Methods of Inquiry

---

  

We have already commented on the most significant circumstance that theoretical analysis of empirical facts always naturally coincides with critical analysis of concepts with creative development of the available, historically established categories, and that novel theoretical conception of facts (a new system of categories) never emerges out of nowhere, never ‘straight from the facts’, as positivists and vulgar scientists would have it, but through a most rigorous scientific critique of the available system of categories.

The problem of creative continuity in the development of theory (the problem of the historical development of science) is always pushed into the foreground when the question arises of the relation of scientific (logical) development to historical.

In his reviews of Marx’s **_Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_** Engels showed clearly that the problem of the relation of the logical to the historical directly emerges before the theoretician as the question of **_the way of criticising available theoretical literature_**. ‘Even after the determination of the method, the critique of economics could still be arranged in two ways – historically or logically’.

However, inasmuch as a novel theoretical conception of facts can only be worked out through critique of available theoretical literature, the mode of critique of theoretical literature coincides essentially with the attitude to facts. Theoretical categories are criticised by comparing them with actual empirical facts. In this respect, there is no difference between the logical and the historical modes of analysis of concepts and facts, and neither can there be.

The difference lies elsewhere. In the so called historical mode of critique of previous theories, they are collated with the same historical facts on the basis of which they were created. For instance, if Marx had chosen the historical mode of critique of Ricardo’s theory, he would have had to compare this theory with facts of Ricardo’s time – that is, the facts of capitalist development of the late 18th-early 19th century.

The theory of Ricardo, its categories and laws would have been critically compared with facts of more or less remote past, with facts of an undeveloped stage of capitalist reality. Yet this mode of critique assumes that the facts themselves have been studied well or must be studied well, whereas in this case the facts were not studied or comprehended scientifically, moreover, they had not been even collected and summed up. Under these conditions, the historical method of critique was apparently inexpedient. It would have merely delayed work.

Therefore Marx preferred the so-called logical mode of critique and correspondingly the logical mode of considering reality.

In this mode, a historically preceding theory is not critically compared with those very facts on the basis of which it emerged but with the facts existing at a difference stage in the development of the object – with the facts directly observed by Marx himself.

This mode has two decisive advantages: first, the facts from Marx’s own time were better known to him and, if need be, could be thoroughly checked out, and second, they revealed the tendencies of capitalist development much more distinctly and acutely than the facts of Ricardo’s time.

Everything that emerged rather vaguely in the early-19th century, assumed a much more mature form of expression by the mid-19th century – suffice it to mention here the economic crises.

The logical mode therefore enables one to consider each economic phenomenon (insofar as we are dealing with political economy) precisely at that point where it reaches a maximal expression and development.

Clearly, logical comparison with the actual facts of developed capitalism revealed with greater facility both the falsity of some of Ricardo’s theoretical propositions and their rational kernel. At the same time, the reality of Marx’s own times was directly expressed. These are the two decisive advantages of the logical mode of analysis of concepts and facts as compared to the historical one.

Still, these advantages would not be apparent and the method of logical analysis itself would not be justified from the philosophical standpoint if we had not shown why and in what way analysis of a higher stage of development can give a historical conception of reality without recourse to a detailed study of the past (for in some cases it is extremely difficult while in others impossible at all, as for instance in the study of cosmology).

In other words, we have to know why and in what way theoretical (systematical logical) analysis of the present can **_simultaneously_** disclose the mystery of the past – of the history that led to the present.

Let us first analyse two relations, that may in principle exist between the development of science and the history of its subject-matter.

In the first instance theory develops within a period of time that is too short for the object itself to undergo any significant changes. This relation is more characteristic of the natural sciences astronomy (cosmology), physics, chemistry, etc.

In this case, application of the logical mode of analysis of concepts and facts is not only justifiable but even the only possible way. The different stages in the development of the science deal with the same historical stage in the development of the object, with the same object at the same stage of development. Thus, Newton, Laplace, Kant, and Otto Schmidt described the same stage in the development of the solar-planetary system.

Application of the logical way of criticising categories (as well as, correspondingly, the mode of theoretical expression of facts) is in this case naturally justified. The old theory and its categories are conceived as an incomplete, one-sided, and abstract expression of the truth. The new theory appears as a more comprehensive and concrete theoretical expression of the essence of the same facts, the same object. The rational kernel of the previous theory is included in the new one as its abstract component. What is discarded is the conception that the old theory comprised in itself an exhaustive expression of the essence of facts. The old theory (of course, not all of it but the rational kernel of it only) becomes in the process one of the shades of the new theory, a particular instance of the universal principle of the new theory.

The theoretician’s right to apply the logical mode of critique of previous theories is here based on the fact that theories and categories analysed with reference to actually given facts reflected **_the very same object_** which he/she now has before his/her eyes. The theoretician therefore arranges a confrontation between theories constructed hundreds of years ago and the facts observed at present, usually without any doubts as to his/her right to do so.

Matters are more complicated in the second case, where different stages in the development of science deal with different historical stages in the development of the object. Here the history of science itself serves as a kind of mirror for the history of the object. Changes in the science reflect major historical changes in the structure of the object itself. The object develops fast enough, and the historical periods in its development coincide with those of the development of the science and its categories.

It goes without saying that this case is more characteristic of the social sciences. A typical example here is political economy. Aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, the science of law are all in much the same situation.

The doubt may naturally arise whether the logical mode of development of theory is in general applicable here.

How can one compare the theory and categories developed hundreds (or even dozens) of years ago with facts observed at present? In this case, the object has changed considerably during these years- will the logical mode of critique of categories be effective in this case? Or will it merely lead to misunderstandings, to expression of different things in the same categories, to theoretically fruitless debate?

The dialectical-materialist conception of development disperses these doubts. It should be taken into account that in this case, too, science throughout its development deals with facts **_referring to one and the same object_**, although this object appears at different stages and phases of its maturity. That means that those really universal and necessary laws that make up the ‘elementary essence’ of the object under study, the abstract outlines of its inner structure, remain the same throughout its historical development. On the other hand, those phenomena and categories which appear at the early stages of development but disappear without a trace at the higher ones, objectively prove, by the very fact of their disappearance, that they are not attributive, internally necessary forms of being of the object.

In his analysis of economic theories and categories developed by his predecessors (not only by Adam Smith and David Ricardo but even by Aristotle), Marx confidently applies the logical mode of critique, using the historical mode only occasionally, as an auxiliary one.

This mode of analysis of the theories of the past is not only admissible but also the most expedient in the development of the **_general theory_** of some subject, as it leaves aside all those moments that are of historical significance only, characterising as they do more or less accidental circumstances within which the development of the object that is of interest for the general theory, proceeded. The logical mode of critique and development of theory gives Marx an objective criterion for distinguishing between categories pertaining to the inner structure of the capitalist organism and all those moments that are connected with forms of production ousted out or destroyed in the course of its development, with the purely local traits of capitalist development in that particular country where the analysed theory emerged, etc.

The advantages of the logical mode of critique of previous theories stem from the fact that the more mature stage in the development of the object, with which the theories of the past are directly compared, reveals the attributive forms of its structure with greater clarity and distinctness, showing them in their quite pure form. The advantage of the logical mode is pointed out by Engels in his review of Marx’s **_Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_**: ‘... each factor can be examined at the stage of development where it reaches its full maturity, its classical form.’

For this reason, we can critically analyse Hegel’s _Logic_ taking into account the facts of development of **_modern_** science rather than those of Hegel’s times, and this critique will result in dialectical elucidation of these facts as well as in materialist conception of the categories of Hegelian dialectics, of their rational kernel.

Taking this into account, Marx believes it to be not only justifiable but also most expedient to choose the logical mode of critique of previous theories and of developing their rational kernel, in the socio-historical fields of knowledge as well as in the natural sciences where the object remains immutable throughout the development of science. There is no gap, in principle, between the natural and social sciences in this respect. Besides, the situation in the natural sciences is not so simple as it may appear at first sight: although Einstein dealt with ‘the same’ object as Newton did, the immediate facts from which he proceeded in his critique of Newtonian mechanics were different. The sensual-practical experimental activity of the social man showed him the same object much more fully and comprehensively. Thus from this side, too, the right to apply the logical mode of critique and development of theory in the social sciences is substantiated just as well as in the natural ones.

In both types of sciences, the social man’s sensual-practical activity proves to be the mediating link between the object ‘in itself’ and the theoretician’s thought. For this reason, **_practice_** appears as the decisive argument in the analysis of the relation between the natural and social sciences, which refutes the neo-Kantian idea of the abyss that in principle exists between the methods of the natural and the socio-historical sciences.

Of course, Marx does not rule out the historical method of critique of his predecessors at all. Marx continually resorts to it, revealing the historical circumstances within which the theory that he criticises emerged. Still, the historical method of critique plays but a subordinate, auxiliary role with him. The principal method of the critique and development of theory remains the logical one.

‘To develop the laws of bourgeois economy, it is not necessary to write **_the real history of the production relations._** But the correct view and deduction of the latter as relations that grew historically, always leads to certain first correlations – like the empirical numerical data in the natural sciences – which point to the past lying behind this system. These indications, together with correct conception of the present, offer then the key to the understanding of the past,’ [**_Grundrisse_**] wrote Marx in 1858.

### Logical Development as Expression of Concrete Historicism in Investigation

---

  

In the above, we formulated the question as follows: why and in what way the theoretical analysis (analysis of facts through a critique of categories) proceeding from the results of the historical process, can in itself yield an essentially historical (though logical in form) expression of reality even where real (empirical) history leading to these results is not directly studied in detail.

The answer to this question can only be obtained through considering the real dialectical laws which govern any actual development in nature, society, and in cognition itself in thought. If, in studying the results of a certain historical process, we can discover the history of their emergence and development sublated in them, if we can, proceeding from the results of history, theoretically reconstruct the general outline of their emergence, this possibility is based in the first place on the fact that the objective result of the development preserves in itself its own history in a changed, sublated form.

Here again, a logical problem is transformed into the problem of law-governed correlation between historical development and its own results. As we pointed out in the above, the really universal and necessary moments characterising the object as a concrete historical whole are preserved in it throughout its existence and development, constituting the law of its concrete historical development.

The problem, then, is to find out in what shape and form the historical conditions of the object’s emergence and development are preserved at the higher stages of its development. Here we confront the fact of dialectical relation between the historically preceding conditions of the emergence of the object and their later consequences that have developed on this basis.

The dialectics of this relation consists in a kind of inversion of the historically preceding into the subsequent and vice versa, the transformation of the condition into the conditioned, of the effect into a cause, of the complex into the elementary, etc.

Owing to this objective dialectics, a situation arises which appears to be paradoxical at first sight: a logical presentation of the laws of the historical process (a conception of facts that is logical in form and concrete historical in essence) is a reversal of the picture that appears to be natural and corresponding to the empirically stated order of the development of the object.

To understand this dialectics, the following fact should be taken into account. Any real process of concrete development (in nature, society, or consciousness) never begins from scratch or in the ether of pure reason but on the basis of premises and conditions created by different processes subject to different laws, and ultimately, by the entire previous development of the universe.

Thus humanity begins its specific history on the basis of premises and conditions created before it and independently of it by nature. The emergence of life (a specifically biological development) implies very complex chemical combinations formed independently from life. Any qualitatively new form of development emerges within the context of circumstances arising independently from it and, moreover, its entire subsequent development lakes place within the same context, a very complex interaction with them. That much is clear. But then we run into a difficulty – the dialectical nature of relations between lower and higher forms of development, and objective changes of their role in this relationship.

The point is that a historically posterior result arising from the entire preceding development does not remain merely a passive result, merely a consequence. Each newly arisen (higher) form of interaction becomes a now universal principle dominating all historically preceding forms, transforming them into secondary external forms of its specific development, into ‘organs of its body’, as Marx put it in connection with one instance of this kind. They begin to move according to laws characteristic of the new system of interaction in which they now function.

The new and higher (historically later) system of concrete interaction begins to preserve and actively reproduce by its own movement, all the really necessary conditions of its movement. It generates, as it were, out of itself everything that was originally created by the previous development and not by itself.

In this case, too, development takes the spiral-like form which we analysed in the first part of the work as a most characteristic feature of internal interaction, of concreteness in the genuine sense of the concept.

The necessarily assumed condition of historical emergence of the object becomes in this case the necessarily posited consequence of its specific development.

In this form, the historically necessary conditions of the emergence of the object are preserved in its structure throughout its development, its specific movement. All those moments which, though present at the birth of the new form of development, were not absolutely necessary conditions of this birth, are not, in the final analysis, preserved or reproduced. These forms are not observed at the higher stages of development of the object – they disappear in the course of its historical maturing, becoming lost in the darkness of the past.

For this reason, a logical consideration of the higher stage of development of an object, of an already developed system of interaction, reveals a picture in which all the really necessary conditions of its emergence and evolution are **_retained_** and all the more or less accidental, purely historical conditions of its emergence are absent.

Logical analysis does not therefore have to free from the purely historical accidentals and from the historical form the presentation of those really universal and absolutely necessary conditions under which the given system of interaction could only emerge and, having emerged, could continue to exist and develop. The historical process itself does the work of this purification instead of and before the theoretician.

In other words, the objective historical process itself carries out the abstraction which retains only the concrete universal moments of development freed from the historical form dependent on the concurrence of more or less accidental circumstances.

Theoretical establishment of such moments results in concrete historical abstractions. That was the principle by which Marx was confidently guided in analysing the categories of political economy.

Labour power as such, as ability for work in general, one of the historical premises of the origin of capital, in the same way as land, air, and mineral deposits. As such, it remains a mere premise of the emergence of capital without being at the same time its consequence or product. On the other hand, capital actively reproduces (engenders as its product) **_labour power as commodity_**, that is, as the concrete historical form in which labour power functions in the capacity of an element of capital.

The same thing occurs with commodities, money, commercial profit, rent, etc.: as such, they belong to ‘antediluvian’ premises of capitalist development, to its ‘prehistoric’ conditions. As concrete historical forms of being of capital, reflecting in their movement its specific history, they are products of capital itself.

As a result, all the really necessary conditions for the emergence of capital are observed on the surface of developed capital as its secondary forms and they are observed in a form that is free from its historical integument. Reproducing them as its product, capital erases all vestiges of their original historical image. Simultaneously, logical analysis provides indications for historical inquiry, too. In its conclusions it guides the historian towards the search for the really necessary conditions and premises of the emergence of a certain process, providing a criterion for distinguishing between the essential and the merely striking, the necessary and the purely accidental, etc.

The dialectics described here does not, of course, take place in the case of capital only. That is a universal law.

The same thing may be observed, for instance, in the formation of the biological form of the movement of matter. Originally, the elementary protein body emerges independently of any biological processes, simply as a chemical product, and a very unstable product at that.

Even now we do not know with sufficient precision in what way and under what concrete conditions this elementary biological formation emerged. Chemistry cannot as yet create a living protein body artificially, it cannot create conditions in which such a body would necessarily emerge. That means that chemists do not yet know what those conditions were.

What is reliably known and objectively established, is the fact that within a developed biological organism these conditions (the entire necessary totality of these conditions) are actually present, they are actually realised as long as the organism lives. The conditions under which matter coming from the outside is transformed into protein, into living matter, can here be determined quite objectively and strictly. At the same time the original products of the chemism may be discovered which are capable of becoming a living body under proper conditions, taking into account that not any substance can be assimilated by the organism.

Thus the study of processes taking place in the organisms living at present, can and does give a key to an understanding of the origin of life on the earth – true, in the most general outline only.

We can conclude that the logical development of categories presenting the internal structure of the object in the form in which it is observed at the higher stages of its development, leads in the first approximation to a conception of the history of its origin, of the law of the formation of this structure. Logical development therefore coincides with historical development internally, in the essence of things. But this coincidence is profoundly dialectical, and it cannot be achieved without a comprehension of this dialectics.

### Abstract and Concrete Historicism

---

  

A concrete understanding of reality cannot be attained without a historical approach to it. The reverse is also true – historicism devoid of concreteness is pure fiction, pseudohistoricism. In these days, one can hardly find a scientist who would reject the idea of development in its general abstract form. But the standpoint of historicism, unless it is combined with the dialectical idea of concreteness, inevitably becomes empty verbiage. Non-concrete, that is, abstract historicism, far from being alien to the metaphysical mode of reasoning, constitutes a most characteristic feature of it. Metaphysicians always expostulate willingly and at length on the need for a historical approach to phenomena, making excursion into the history of the object, and working on ‘historical substantiations’ of their theoretical constructions. Distinguishing between the concrete historicism of the method of materialist dialectics and the abstract historicism of metaphysicians is not as easy as might seem at first sight.

It is very easy to slide to the standpoint of abstract historicism (or pseudohistoricism). Moreover, this standpoint appears to be the most natural one. Indeed, isn’t it natural to consider the history which created an object if one wants to form a historical conception of the object?

But this simple and natural view quickly leads to insoluble difficulties. To begin with, any historically emerging object has behind it, as its past, the entire infinite history of the Universe. Therefore, an attempt to understand a phenomenon historically through tracing out all the processes and premises preceding its birth inevitably leads into bad infinity and for this reason, if not for any other, will not result in anything definite or concrete.

Whether one wishes to do so or not, but in going back one will have to stop somewhere, to begin at some point. Now, what is one to begin with? Abstract historicism sets no limits here for subjectivism and arbitrariness.

But that is not all. The standpoint of abstract historicism leads, inevitably and irrespectively of one’s desires, to crude antihistoricism, under the guise of the historical approach. It is not difficult to see why that is so. Bourgeois economists, who interpret capital as accumulated labour in general, quite logically and naturally consider the hour of its historical birth to be the hour in which the primitive man picked up a club. If capital is conceived as money bringing new money from circulation, the historical beginnings of capital will inevitably be found somewhere in Phoenicia. An antihistorical conception of the essence or nature of the phenomenon is in this case justified by ‘historical’ arguments. There is nothing surprising about it – the comprehension of the past is closely linked with the comprehension of the present. Before one considers the history of the object, one is obliged to form a clear conception of the nature of the object whose history is to be studied.

The result of application of the principle of abstract historicism is this: the history of a certain phenomenon is described in terms of facts pertaining to the history of quite different phenomena, those that merely prepared the emergence of the former phenomenon historically. By this trick, the given concrete historical phenomenon appears to the theoretician either eternal or in any case very ancient, much more ancient than it actually is.

A most striking example of this abstract historical approach, of conception that is historical in appearance and antihistorical in essence, is the bourgeois economists’ explanation of the primitive accumulation.

The bourgeois economist also views this process ‘historically’. He will easily agree that capital is not an eternal phenomenon, that it must have emerged somewhere and in some manner. The history of its origin consists in that the means of production were in some way concentrated in the hands of a few persons. How did that happen historically?

These ways are extremely varied. In any case, the fact remains that the means of production were first concentrated in the hands of the future capitalist in any manner but exploitation of wage labour, through frugality, the future capitalist’s own labour, successful commercial operations, simple robbery, feudal legacy, and so on and so forth.

From this, the bourgeois economist draws the conclusion that in its origin, and consequently in its essence, capital is not the product of unpaid-for labour of the wage worker. As for the worker himself, he/she descended ‘historically’ from the serf who ran away to town from a cruel landlord, or a craftsman impoverished through inability, or a lazy vagabond. In other words, the wage labourer was created by processes other than capitalist exploitation. The capitalist offering him work now appears as a benefactor.

It is quite apparent here that a formally historical explanation is made into a means of shameless apology for the existing state of things. Historical substantiation becomes an argument in favour of an antihistorical conception of both the process of primitive accumulation and of the nature of capital. Historical arguments are used to present capital as an ‘eternal’ and ‘natural’ relation. The secret of the trick is in the history of the origin of the historical premises of capital being directly presented as the history of capital itself as a concrete historical phenomenon.

The real historical beginning of the development of capital, as Marx showed, was the point at which capital began to build its body out of the unpaid-for labour of the wage worker. Only at this point does its specific concrete history begin. As for the original concentration of the means of production in the hands of the future capitalist, it may take any form whatever – that has no significance for the history of capital as capital and no relevance to the being of man, possessing it, as the being of a capitalist.

Originally, our mode of appropriation is not that of a capitalist, and the ways in which he appropriates the product of labour has no bearing on his history as a capitalist. They lie somewhere below the lower boundary of the history of capital, just as processes that created the premises of life, the chemical processes, lie below the lower limit of the history of life, pertaining to the field of chemistry rather than of biology.

The same thing has to be borne in mind in logic, in order not to take the history of the premises of a concept (abstractions in general, words expressing the general in their meaning, etc.) for the history of the concept itself.

Thus the significance becomes apparent of the principle of **_concrete historicism_** which imposes the requirement of establishing, in a strictly objective manner, the point at which the real history of the object under consideration begins, the genuinely concrete starting point of its origin.

The problem is the same whether we are dealing with the emergence of the capitalist system or the historical origin of man or the point at which life was born on the earth or the ability to think in concepts.

The precepts of abstract historicism merely disorientate the theoretician in this decisive field of theoretical analysis. As is well known, scientists often took the biological prehistory of human society for an undeveloped form of human existence, and biological laws, for abstract, elementary, and universal laws of human development. Examples of the same kind are attempts to deduce man’s aesthetic feeling from certain externally similar phenomena of the animal world – the beauty of the peacock’s tail, the colours of the butterfly’s wing and other purely biological adaptive phenomena.

The historicism of the logical method of Marx, Engels, and Lenin is concrete. It means that the concrete history of a concrete object should be considered in each particular case rather than history in general. The former is of course more difficult than the latter. But scientific research cannot be guided by the principle of ease, the principle of ‘economy of intellectual effort’, despite the neo-Kantian illusions. Scientific development can only be guided by the principle of correspondence with the object, and where the object is complex, there simply is nothing to be done.

The logical development of categories, in the form of which the construction of the system of science is completed, must coincide with the historical development of the object, in the same way as reflection coincides with that which is reflected. The sequence of the categories itself must reproduce the real historical sequence in which the object of investigation and its structure are formed.

That is the main principle of dialectics. The whole difficulty lies in the fact that the concrete history of the concrete object is not so easy to single out in the ocean of the real facts of empirical history, for it is not the ‘pure history’ of the given concrete object that is given in contemplation and immediate notion but a very complicated mass of interconnected processes of development mutually interacting and altering the forms of their manifestation. The difficulty lies in singling out from the empirically given picture of the total historical process the cardinal points of the development of this particular concrete object, of the given, concrete system of interaction. Logical development coinciding with the historical process of the formation of a concrete whole should rigorously establish its historical beginning, its birth, and later trace its evolution as a sequence of necessary and law-governed moments. That is the whole difficulty.

The capitalist system, for instance, does not emerge out of nothing but on the basis of and within historically preceding forms of economic relations, its concrete development involving the struggle and overcoming of these forms. Having originally emerged as a rather inconspicuous but more viable mode of economic relations, this system gradually transforms all types of production existing at the time of its birth in accordance with its own requirements and in its own image. It gradually converts earlier independent and even alien forms of economy into forms of its own realisation, subordinating them, partly breaking them down so that there is not a trace of them left, partly continuing to drag (sometimes for a very long time) the debris that it had no time to destroy, and partly developing into full flowering something that had previously existed only as a tentative tendency.

As a result, the historical development of a concrete whole, conceived in its essence and expressed in logical development does not coincide with the picture that is to be formed on the surface of events, that is open to the theoretically naked eye. The essence and the phenomena here also coincide only dialectically, only through contradiction.

Therefore the logical development of categories intended to reflect the real historical sequence of the formation of the analysed system of interacting phenomena, cannot be directly guided by the sequence in which certain aspects of the whole in the process of formation appeared or played the decisive role on the surface of the historical process open to empirical contemplation. ‘It would be inexpedient and wrong therefore to present the economic categories successively in the order in which they have played the dominant role in history’ that was the way in which Marx categorically summed up the methodological significance of this real circumstance.

The theoretician who accepts abstractly interpreted historicism is guided by the principle of analysis which Marx defines as-inexpedient and wrong. When he considers phenomena in the sequence in which they follow one another in the historical time, in the sequence which appears at first sight as the most natural one, in actual fact he considers them in a sequence that is the reverse of the real and objective one.

The apparent and imaginary correspondence between the logical and the historical here conceals from the theoretician an actual absence of correspondence. Very often (much more often than the empiricist believes) the genuine objective cause of a phenomenon appears on the surface of the historical process later than its own consequence.

For instance, the general crisis of overproduction in the capitalist world is empirically manifested first of all in the form of disturbances in the sphere of bank credits, as a financial crisis, later it involves commerce and only at the very end does it reveal itself in the sphere of direct production as a real general crisis of overproduction. The superficial observer, who takes succession in time for the only historical principle, concludes from this that misunderstandings and conflicts in bank clearances are the cause, the basis, and the source of the general crisis. In other words, he/she takes the most abstract and derivative effect for the real basis of events, while the objective basis inevitably begins to seem the effect of its own effect.

In this way crude empiricism yields the same absurd result as the most refined scholasticism. Crude empiricism in general inevitably becomes the worst kind of scholasticism when it is raised to the principle of theoretical explanation of events.

From the standpoint of science and of genuine historicism it is quite obvious however that overproduction had taken place before it had time to manifest itself in disturbances and confusion in the sphere of bank clearance, these disturbances merely reflecting in their own way the actually accomplished fact and in no way creating it. Logical development of categories in the system of science corresponds to the genuine historical sequence concealed from empirical observation, but it contradicts the external appearance, the superficial aspect of this sequence.

The correctly established logical order of development of categories in the system of science discloses the secret of the real objective sequence of development of phenomena, of the aspects of the object, permitting to understand the chronological sequence itself just as scientifically rather than empirically, from the standpoint of the ordinary person. Logical development of categories in science contradicts temporal sequence exactly because it corresponds to the genuine and objective sequence of the formation of the concrete structure of the object under study. Herein lies the dialectics of the logical and the historical.

The ‘historically anterior’ continually becomes the ‘logically posterior’ in the course of development, and vice versa. Phenomena that emerged earlier than others as often as not become forms of manifestation of processes that started much later. The beginning (the genuine beginning) of a new branch of development, of a novel concrete historical system of interaction, cannot be understood as a product of a smooth evolution of the historically preceding forms. What takes place here is a genuine leap, a break in the development, in which a fundamentally new concrete historical form of development begins.

This new direction of development can only be understood out of itself, from its intrinsic contradictions. Each newly appearing concrete historical process has its own concrete historical beginning. In regard of economic development Marx expressed this circumstance in these terms:

‘There is in every social formation a particular branch of production which determines the position and importance of all the others. and the relations obtaining in this branch accordingly determine the relations of all other branches as well. It is as though light of a particular hue were cast upon everything, tingeing all other colours and modifying their specific features; or as if a special ether determined the specific gravity of everything found in it.’ (Marx, _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_)

Clearly this law is not restricted in its action to social development or social phenomena in general. Development in nature also takes this form and cannot take any other. Here too, a new concrete form of development emerges on the basis of and within the framework of those that precede it, becoming a concrete universal principle of a new system and as such involving these chronologically preceding forms in its specific concrete history.

From this point on the historical destiny of these historically preceding phenomena comes to be determined by entirely new laws. The chemical substances involved in the development of life behave in this process in quite a different manner from the way they had behaved before and independently from it. They are subject to the universal law of this higher new form, and their movement can only be understood from the laws of life, from the concrete universal laws of this higher and chronologically later form of the motion of matter.

The laws of these elementary forms cannot, of course, be violated, abolished or altered. But they become here subordinate laws, abstract universal laws that can explain absolutely nothing in the movement of the concrete whole the external manifestations of which they became. The development of organic life also results in the formation of ‘a special kind of ether’ which determines the share of any being that exists in it.

This ‘specific ether’, that is, the concrete universal principle of a new and higher form of movement that emerges chronologically at a later stage but becomes the dominant principle, must be understood in science before any other and first of all on its own merits, from the internally inherent concrete universal contradictions.

The historically preceding elements that, owing to the dialectics of development, became a secondary, auxiliary moment of the new form of movement, a kind of material in which some new concrete historical process is realised, may indeed be understood only from the concrete universal law of the higher form in whose movement they are involved.

These historically preceding elements may long pre-exist the logically prior ones, they may even constitute the condition of origin of this logically anterior, concrete universal phenomenon, later becoming its manifestation or product.

Rent as a form of capitalist economy cannot be comprehended before capital is comprehended, while capital may and must be understood in its internal contradictions before rent, though rent historically emerged earlier than capital and even served as a historical condition of its origin. Quite a few landlords, having accumulated feudal rent, later began to use it as capital. The same is true of commercial profit.

The historical destiny of rent and commercial profit as elements of the capitalist whole, as forms of manifestation and modifications of capital may be compared, for graphic effect, to the destiny of a block of marble, out of which the statue of a man is sculptured.

The concrete form of marble can in no way be explained from the properties of marble itself. Although it is the form of marble, in its real substance it is by no means the form of marble as a product of nature. Marble owes its form not to itself, not to its own nature, but to the process in which it is involved – the process of man’s artistic development.

For millions of years marble lay in the ground, it appeared long before man, not only before the sculptor’s time but also before mankind as a whole. But the concrete form in which it is displayed in the hall of a museum is the product of man’s development, which commenced much later than marble as such, marble as mineral, appeared. That is an active form of some quite different process, a process that is realised in marble and through marble but naturally cannot be understood in terms of marble alone.

The situation is the same with the concrete historical form of the existence of rent, interest, commercial profit and similar forms and categories. In capitalist production, they are secondary, subordinate forms of economy, forms of manifestation of surplus-value of a form that appeared much later than they themselves did.

This concrete universal form should be understood in science before and quite independently from all the their concrete history as the history of forms of being of surplus value began when and where they were involved in the production and accumulation of surplus-value, so that they became organs of its body and a mode of its realisation. Before that point, their destinies had no internal relation whatever to the history of capitalism, to the history expressed in the sequence of categories of political economy. They had existed before that moment outside the history of capital, side by side with it but quite independently from it. But they became involved in the formation of the capitalist system, turning into concrete historical forms and elements of the given system, only in those areas where the concrete universal form of capital, which had developed independently from them, expressed its movement through them.

Thus logical development does not reproduce history as a whole, but rather the concrete history of the given concrete historical whole, of the given concrete system of phenomena interacting in a specific manner.

The logical order of the categories of science directly corresponds to this history and its sequence; it is the latter that is expressed in a theoretically generalised form. Logical development of categories and their concrete definitions cannot therefore be guided by the principle of abstract historicism (or pseudohistoricism), the principle of temporal sequence of the emergence of diverse forms of the analysed whole in history.

Contrariwise, it is only logical development of categories that is guided by the relation in which the elements of the analysed concreteness stand to one another in the developed object, in the object at the highest point of its development and maturity, that discovers the mystery of the genuine objective sequence of the formation of the object, of the moulding of its internal structure.

Following this path, we can always discover the genuinely natural (rather than the seemingly natural) order of development of all the aspects of the analysed concrete historical whole. In this case we shall attain a real coincidence of the logical and the historical. Otherwise we can only arrive at a divergence between the two, at an empirical scholastic expression of history, but not at its objective theoretical reflection in concept.

The inquiry into the system of capitalist production in **_Capital_** was a splendid confirmation of the correctness of this methodological principle, of Marx’s and Engels’ philosophical view of the dialectics of the historical process and its theoretical reproduction.

To form a genuinely historical conception of the capitalist formation, of the laws of its historical emergence, development, and decline, Marx studied first of all the **_existing_** state of this formation, proceeding from the contemporary situation, from the relation in which the diverse elements of its necessary structure stand to one another proceeding from this existing factually stated situation, he analysed the concepts and categories of political economy, studied these concepts critically, and unfolded, on the basis of this analysis, his theoretical conception of the facts, a system of theoretical definitions.

Each of the aspects and elements of the structure of the capitalist organism found therefore its concrete theoretical expression, and was reflected in a concrete historical abstraction.

The theoretical definitions of each category of political economy were formed by Marx through tracing the history of its emergence not the empirical history but the history ‘sublated’ in its results.

This inquiry led him directly to a conception of the real historically necessary premises of the emergence of bourgeois economy, offering thereby a key to a theoretical understanding of the empirical history of its emergence and evolution. On the other hand, owing to this method of inquiry, the bourgeois formation itself emerged as a system of historically maturing premises of the birth of another, new, and higher system of social relations – of socialism, into which the capitalist system of production of material life inevitably develops under the pressure of the internal contradictions of its evolution.

Broad Overview:

[The German Ideology](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/index.htm)

"The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature....Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.

[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm)

"The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange.

§ 2: Private property by no means makes its appearance in history as the result of robbery or force. On the contrary. It already existed, though limited to certain objects, in the ancient primitive communities of all civilised peoples. It developed into the form of commodities within these communities.....  
§ 3: The question at issue is how we are to explain the origin of classes and relations based on domination, and if Herr Dühring's only answer is the one word "force", we are left exactly where we were at the start.  
§ 4: All religion, however, is nothing but the fantastic reflection in men's minds of those external forces which control their daily life, a reflection in which the terrestrial forces assume the form of supernatural forces. In the beginnings of history it was the forces of nature which were first so reflected, and which in the course of further evolution underwent the most manifold and varied personifications among the various peoples.

### [Marx Myths & Legends](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/index.htm)

## Introduction

A critical reading of the work of Karl Marx now requires us to lay to one side the myths and legends which have obscured his ideas over the past one hundred and twenty years- distortions and misinterpretations to which perhaps no thinker has been more prone. In one sense, this is not difficult, because there is enough of his writing preserved, albeit in translation, for any of us to read Marx in his own words. Most however have been unwilling or unable to do this. The fifty volumes of the Marx-Engels Collected Works are forbidding, and when beginning as one almost inevitably does, with the received wisdom surrounding Marx’s name, there is much to discourage a reader from seriously taking on the task of understanding Marx. The aim of this project is thus to begin to challenge some of those myths in order to clear the way for a fresh reading of Marx that will hopefully be less prone to the distortions, misunderstandings and blatant falsehoods that have so far surrounded Marx. We believe that what Marx had to say remains of considerable relevance to an understanding of problems we face today, but that a reading of Marx now must maintain a critical caution which does not merely reproduce received ideas- positive or negative- about Marx’s work.

The distortion and questionable interpretation of Marx’s work is in many senses a direct result of his great success. His name became synonymous with a vast movement which not only changed, but virtually defined the twentieth century. The leaders of the communist parties needed to prove themselves true disciples of Marx, while anti-communists followed suit by attributing everything they hated to Karl Marx. Interpretation of Marx has thus been driven by a number of historical factors, and any attempts to gain, for example, a “scholarly” understanding have necessarily been secondary. Yet this is not to mourn any supposed loss of the purity of Marx’s thought to the struggles and conflicts in which he has been implicated! It is not simply a case of counterposing a “true” Marx to the Marx that gave his name to the movements of the twentieth century. To set against the distortions we cannot raise up a singular, uncontradictory Marx, abstracted from history and ultimately separable from everything that comes within “Marxism”, yet it remains that there is much in that received wisdom about Marx that _is_ refutable, or at least rendered distinctly questionable, with a little attention to the textual and historical evidence.

There is thus, on the one hand, the generally _negative_ task of demythologising Marx where we need primarily to just look at the evidence carefully. This task is the guiding one of “Marx Myths & Legends”, but on the other hand Marx interpretation must to some extent also involve a battle over facts, and the negative task is inextricable from a more positive interpretive one. In areas where controversies remain, we hope to present a heterodox and critically open account, whilst the project itself will be ongoing, with new texts added gradually to cover more areas of Marx mythology and take account of other areas of debate.

## Divisions of Marx Myths & Legends

The myths and legends about Marx broadly fall from the start into two camps; on the one hand those myths propagated tendentiously or maliciously by opponents of socialism, and on the other, the myths of those who claimed Marx as their authority. They have been the product of various historical factors, and the question of any _responsibility_ for such myths is a complex one. But it remains of central importance that Marx is fundamentally a contested thinker, bound more than any other to specific interests and conflicts within modernity, and the myths and legends historically reflect this.

Both of the broad “pro” and “anti” camps share thereby a common core of myths, namely those which conflate Karl Marx with the Communist International, and its most prominent leaders, Lenin and Stalin. The ghastly nature of “real existing socialism” and the ideology of those states has often been simplistically identified with Marx by opponents of socialism. The first group of myths which we deal with therefore are those which ascribe to Karl Marx political ideas about workers’ states, state-ownership, centralised planning and suppression of individual freedom. These are dealt with primarily in the section on ‘“Myths Conflating Marx with “State Socialism”’

Another group of myths about Marx that have been propagated by opponents of socialism are ad hominem: they seek to call into question Marx’s ideas by attacking his character. Articles dealing with these myths are grouped under the section on “Myths about Marx’s Character”. According to these legends, Marx was a megalomaniac, a bully, an anti-Semite and a racist, a snob, a womaniser and a sexist, a boring writer and a plagiarist. It is easy to anachronistically impute such charges to individuals of periods prior to contemporary notions of political correctness, but without employing a kind of historical relativism it is valid to question the real intellectual and historical merits of such accusations when their target is often more properly the prejudices and illusions of an entire age than those of an individual. Works such as Hal Draper’s “Marx and the Economic-Jew Stereotype” can thus be useful in elucidating the real historical context of some of Marx’s remarks and language. Though Marx, as represented by Francis Wheen for example, may not have been a perfect human being, it is fair to say that many commonplace stories about Marx’s character are distinctly questionable.

The contexts of the reception of Marx’s ideas have been very different from that in which they were formed, and this in itself is perhaps the reason for many myths. Marx’s way of thinking was arguably already somewhat alien to the dominant intellectual trends of its time, and the critical spirit on which Marx had been raised as a Young Hegelian was foreign to the majority of his original readers. Consequently, from the moment what he wrote left his pen it was interpreted in the spirit of nineteenth century socialism, and its dialectical, Hegelian aspects were largely misunderstood or just set aside. Thus a third group of myths is also shared by many friends and foes alike: myths conflating Marx with 19th Century socialism and positivism.

His most intelligent interpreters, and those who were to become his principal advocates after his death, were capable of distinguishing between the ideology of the broader socialist movement of the times and the ideas of Karl Marx, even if they did not clearly understand that difference. The fourth and most enduring group of myths about Karl Marx originates from his most illustrious and faithful advocates, Frederick Engels, Georgi Plekhanov and Karl Kautsky, and were perpetuated by the leaders and thinkers of “actually existing socialism”. According to these, Marx was the founder of a coherent philosophical and metaphysical system, and a definite, repeatable methodology. We are talking about the myth of dialectical materialism, or “scientific socialism” — that ideology “cast from a single piece of steel”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/intro.htm#foot-1). Beyond this group we must add further “Myths of Marxism”- myths based on more simplistic interpretations of Marx’s ideas: that Marx was an economic determinist, or for that matter, any kind of determinist or any kind of economist, that Marx declared philosophy to be obsolete, or alternatively, that he was a materialist philosopher.

Lastly we come to a collection of more recently founded myths- some of which have their roots in Marxist tradition, but have become more important in later debates. In this group we place the myth that conflates Marx with Alexandre Kojève and Hegel’s “master-servant dialectic,” the myth that Marx had a theory of ideology as “false consciousness”, and the myth that there is a necessarily disdainful attitude towards the natural world in Marx’s allegedly “promethean” or productivist views. These myths can perhaps be attributed to a filtering of Marx through the intellectual climate of the second half of the twentieth century, in which issues of “recognition”, “ideology critique”, and the critique of the “Enlightenment” dominated.

The categories dealt with so far in this project are intended only provisionally, and do not cover exhaustively every area of Marx mythology. As the project grows we intend to broaden its scope and increasingly cover areas of potential controversy, as well as developing upon what we already have through critical dialogue.

Marx should be read just as you would read anyone else: critically and for yourself, not uncritically or secondhand. Marx Myths & Legends will have succeeded as a project if it at least helps some to begin to study Marx with a strong mistrust for the prejudices, preconceptions and layers of congealed misinterpretation that surround his life and work.

# A Manifesto of Emancipation:  
Marx’s “Marginal Notes to the Programme of the German Workers’ Party”  
after One hundred and twenty-five years

---

An earlier version of the paper was presented at “Marxism 2000,” University of Massachusetts at Amherst, September 21-24, 2000. Amended by the author for inclusion in “Marx Myths and Legends.”

---

Marx’s “Marginal Notes” of 1875 or what he called in a letter (to Bracke, May 5, 1875), a “long scrap of paper,” was a purely occasional text which its author felt compelled to compose, in order to underline what he thought to be the serious shortcomings in a workers’ programme. However, the document could perhaps be considered kind of a second “Communist Manifesto,” authored by Marx alone this time of course. Both of them concern party organisation — the Communist League and the German Workers’ Party. The second document was enriched by Marx’s great theoretical breakthroughs as well as by his involvement in the new forms of working class struggles as manifested above all in the work of the First International and the Paris Commune, posterior to the “Communist Manifesto.” Given the necessarily limited scope of this second document, compared with the first, its focus is also relatively circumscribed, being confined to the critique of the _specific points_ in the Programme that Marx found unacceptable. Nevertheless, in spite of the narrowness of scope and the resulting selective character of the themes involved, this document contains, drawing on the author’s whole life’s work, a condensed discussion of the most essential elements of the capitalist mode of production, its revolutionary transformation into its opposite and a rough portrayal, in a few bold strokes, of what Marx had called in _Capital_ the “union of free individuals” destined to succeed the existing social order.

In this paper we propose to concentrate mostly on the economic aspects of this document. As in the _Gothakritik_ labour is the central theme around which Marx’s arguments revolve, we start with Marx’s critique of the conception of labour as it appears in the Programme. Next we pass on to Marx’s very brief discussion of the Lassallean notion of wage labour which of course is the essence of the capitalist mode of production. Then we propose to treat Marx’s portrayal of the future society centered basically on the problem of allocation-distribution of the society’s total product. We conclude by stressing the immensely emancipatory character of the document. As we go along we will seek to dispel a number of misunderstandings — even among Marx’s professed followers — concerning Marx’s categories of labour, value and state, all appearing in the “Critique.”

### Labour and Division of Labour

The _Gothakritik_ starts with the Programme’s assertion that labour is the source of all wealth and all culture. Marx underlines _à contrario_ that labour is not the source of all material wealth and that nature also is a source. This idea of wealth as the conjoint product of human labour and nature is a continuing idea of the Marxian “Critique of Political Economy” from its very inception. In his Parisian manuscripts of 1844 Marx refers to nature as the “_non-organic life”_ of the human and the human as “a part of nature.” “The labourer can create nothing without nature, without the _sensuous_ (_sinniliche_) _external world_” (1966a: 77,80, emphasis in text) ... One and a half decades later Marx writes: “It is false to say that labour in so far as it creates (_hervorbringt_) use values, that is material wealth, is the unique source of the latter ... The use value always has a natural substratum. Labour is the natural condition of the human, the condition of material exchange between human and nature, independent of all social forms” (1958: 30). This whole idea would appear in almost identical terms in _Capital_ I.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n1) Speaking of labour in the labour process where products do not take commodity form, Marx observes that “this is the purposeful (_zweckmässig_) activity for the creation of use-values, the appropriation of the objects of nature for human needs, the global condition of material exchange between the human and nature, an everlasting natural condition of human existence and thus independent of all forms of this existence, rather equally common to all its social forms” (1962a: 198; 1965: 735. In the French version the expression “natural condition” was changed for “physical necessity” and the term “everlasting” was dropped). In the same way, in his manuscript for _Capital_ III Marx writes about labour as “human productive activity in general through which the human mediates material exchanges with nature, divested not only of all determinate social forms and characters but even in its simple natural existence, independent of society and removed from all societies, and, as an expression and affirmation of life, common to the human not yet social and to the one who is in any way determined socially” (1992: 843-44. Engels’s edited version is very slightly different. See Marx 1964: 823-24).

The second point about labour and its role in production — nature’s contribution being abstracted here — that Marx makes in the _Gothakritik_ concerns labour’s relation to society in this regard. Correcting the somewhat defective formulation of the “Program,” Marx observes that only labour producing in society — “social labour” — creates “material wealth;” isolated labour can create use value only. About a decade earlier Marx had told the workers that “a man who produces an article for his own immediate use, consumes it himself, creates a product but not a commodity,” and that “to produce a commodity” it is “not only _Labour_ but _social Labour_” that is relevant (1968: 201; emphasis and capitalization are in text). It is also well known that according to Marx it is not labour as such but “socially necessary labour (time)” that produces commodities. Some critics of Marx, particularly among the feminists, have inferred from these statements that according to Marx the only labour that is social is commodity producing labour (see the discussion in Custers 1997). However, this inference is invalid. From the premise that only social labour produces commodities it does not follow that only the commodity producing labour is social labour. Apart from this _non sequitur_, such a position would signify that all use value producing labour is non-social labour, that all labour engaged in material production in non-commodity societies is non-social labour — which of course would be absurd from Marx’s point of view.

First of all, in what sense commodity producing labour is “social labour"? Marx’s position is very clear on this question. This type of labour is social labour because it is subordinated to the _social_ division of labour, is _socially_ determined average labour (time), and destined to satisfy certain _social_ want. Secondly, the producers here enter into _social_ contact through exchange of products taking commodity form. Marx, at the same time stresses the very _specific_ character of the sociality of this labour. “The conditions of labour positing exchange value are _social determinants_ of labour or determinants of _social labour_, but social not in a general (_schlechthin_), but in a particular (_besondere_) way. This is a specific kind of sociality.” It is a situation in which “each one labours for oneself and the particular labour has to appear as its opposite, abstract general labour,” and “in this form social labour.” It has this “specific social character only within the limits of exchange” (1958: 24; 1959: 525; 1962a: 87; emphasis in text).

The third point about labour in Marx’s critique of the “Program” is how Marx envisages labour in the new society after capital has disappeared from the scene. At its initial phase the new society cannot yet completely get rid of the legacy of the mode of labour of the old society — including the division of labour, particularly the division between physical and mental labour. Now, in one of his early texts Marx speaks of the “abolition of the division of labour” as the task of the “communist revolution,” even of “abolition of labour” _tout court_ (1973a: 70, 364). However, in the _Gothakritik_ Marx’s stand does not appear to be quite the same on this question. Referring to “a higher phase” of the Association which will have completely transgressed “the narrow bourgeois horizon,” Marx does not say that either labour or division of labour would be “abolished.” He stresses that labour in that society would not simply be a means of life but would itself become life’s “first need.” Similarly not all division of labour would be abolished, but only the division of labour which puts the individuals under its “enslaving subordination” (_knechtende Unterordnung_). Let us examine to which extent there is a “break” (“_coupure_”) between the early Marx and the late Marx in this regard. In his Parisian excerpt notebooks of 1844 Marx distinguishes between two types of labour. The first is labour in the absence of private property in the means of production where “we produce as human beings.” Here labour is a “free manifestation of life and therefore enjoyment of life,” where the “particularity of my life is affirmed.” Here labour is “true, active property.” Contrariwise, the second type of labour, that is labour exercised under private property, is the “alienation of life.” Here “my individuality is to such an extent alienated that this activity is hated by me and is a torment. It is only an appearance of activity imposed only by an external, contingent necessity, and not enjoined by an inner necessary need” (1932: 546, 547). One year later, in another manuscript, Marx observes that the labourer’s activity is not “a free manifestation of his human life,” it is rather a “bartering away (_Verschachern_), an alienation of his powers to capital.” Marx calls this activity “_labour_” and writes that “‘labour’ by nature (_Wesen_) is unfree, inhuman, unsocial activity conditioned by and creating private property,” and then adds that “the abolition of private property only becomes a reality if it is conceived as the abolition of ‘_labour_’” (1972a: 435-36; emphasis in text).

Now, labour as a pure process of material exchange between human beings and nature is a “simple and abstract” category and as such does not take account of the social conditions in which it operates. However, all production, considered as “appropriation of nature from the side of the individual,” takes place “within and is mediated by definite social forms” (Marx 1958: 241, 280). When labour’s social dimension is brought in, labour takes on a new meaning. The question becomes relevant as to whether the labour process operates “under the brutal lash of the slave supervision or the anxious eye of the capitalist” (1962a: 198-99). In fact these two broad forms of labour epitomize, by and large, at least the dominant type of labour that has operated in all class-societies. Traditionally, labour has been a non-free activity of the labouring individual — either as directly forced labour under “personal dependence” as in pre-capitalism or as alienated labour under “material dependence” or “servitude of the object” (_Knechtshaft des Gegenstandes_) in commodity-capitalist society (Marx 1953: 75; 1966a: 76). Such labour has reduced the labourer into a “labouring animal” (Marx 1962b: 256). Consequently, the division of labour practised so far has been absolutely involuntary where the “human being’s own activity dominates the human being as an alien, opposite power” (Marx 1973a: 33). It goes without saying that such labour is totally incompatible with the human being’s “free individuality” under the Association. This labour in the sense of the “traditional mode of activity” (_bisherige Art der Tätigkeit_) ceases to exist in the Association, it is “abolished” (Marx 1973a: 70). Referring to Adam Smith’s idea of labour being “sacrifice of freedom,” Marx notes that labour, as it has appeared “in its historical forms of slavery, serfdom and wage labour,” always appears “repulsive, forced from outside;” labour has not yet created the “subjective and objective conditions in which labour would be attractive and self-realising for the individual.” However, labour could also be seen as an “activity of freedom,” as self-realizing and indeed as “real freedom” when labour is exercised toward removing the obstacles for reaching an end (not imposed from outside) (1953: 505). Thus when Marx speaks of “abolition” of division of labour and labour itself in his writings anterior to the _Gothakritik_, it is precisely with reference to the different forms of hitherto existing modes of labour which far from being a self-realizing activity of the individual, unimposed from the exterior, a free manifestation of human life, has been their negation. This is the labour which has to be abolished along with the associated division of labour. Thereby labour, transformed into a “self (affirming) activity” (_Selbstätigkeit_), becomes, as the _Gothakritik_ says not only a means of life but also life’s “prime need” in a higher phase of the Association.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n2) Again, it is about this hitherto existing type of labour that Marx observes in the _Gothakritik_ that the “law of the whole hitherto existing history “has been that “in proportion as labour is socially developed and thereby becomes a source of wealth and culture, there develops poverty and demoralization on the side of the labourers, wealth and culture on the side of the non-labourers.”

### Significance of Wage Labour

Marx portrays, in a few bold strokes, the essence of the capitalist mode of production through his attack on the Lassallean idea of wage which Lassalle had taken over from the bourgeois economists. Here Marx makes two points. The first concerns the Lassallean “iron law of wages,” where wages are supposed to be at a level corresponding to the minimum of subsistence just sufficient for the workers to live and the perpetuate their class. It should be pointed out that this formulation of wage determination by the workers’ minimum subsistence is not very different from the formulation that we find in Marx’s writings in the 1840s (see Marx 1965: 27, 152; 1966b: 65; 1973: 406). In his polemic with Proudhon on the question of wage labour, Marx’s reference point was Ricardo’s “natural price of labour which is necessary to enable the labourers to subsist and to perpetuate their race” (see Ricardo 1951: 93). In fact Engels himself pointed out in a note in the first German edition (1885) of Marx’s Proudhon-critique (1847) that the formulation was first advanced by him (Engels) in 1844 and 1845. “Marx had adopted it and Lassalle had borrowed it from us.”[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n3) Later Marx abandoned this position. Instead Marx emphasized in _Capital_ the relativity of natural needs of the labourer — food, clothing, heating, housing — dictated by climate and physical conditions of a country as well as “a moral and historical element.” Particularly during the process of “extensive” accumulation of capital, the labourers receiving in the form of payment a bigger portion of the net product — created by themselves — have the possibility of “increasing the circle of their enjoyment, of being better fed, clothed and furnished and making a small reserve fund” (1962a: 185, 646; 1965: 720, 1127). Similarly in unpublished ‘sixth chapter’ of _Capital_ Marx wrote: “The minimum wage of the slave appears as a constant magnitude, independent of his labour. For the free labourer this _value of his labour power_ and the corresponding _average wage_ are not predestined by the limits determined by his sheer physical needs, independently of his own labour. It is here like the value of all commodities, a more or less _constant average_ for the _class_; but it does not exist in this immediate reality for the individual labourer whose wage may stay above or below this minimum” (1988: 102; emphasis in text). In the _Gothakritik_ Marx cites Lange’s work showing the Malthusian population theory as the basis of Lassalle’s iron law of wages.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n4) In this connection it must be stressed that while Marx has no minimum subsistence theory of wages he does speak of “absolute impoverishment” of the labourers under capitalism, which has an unusual and deep significance. In fact _wage labour_ itself — irrespective of the level of wages received by the labourer — signifies “absolute poverty” of the labourer. In two manuscripts Marx tersely identifies, almost in the same words, “labour (labour power) as the absolute poverty not as penury but as total exclusion from the objective wealth” [1953: 203; 1976b; 148. “Labour” (_Arbeit_) in the first manuscript was changed into “labour power (_Arbeitsvermögen)_ in the second].[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n5)

The second point that Marx makes on wage labour is of the highest importance clearly showing his fundamental difference with the entire bourgeois political economy (“classical” as well as “vulgar”) in this regard.

Marx underlines that wage is not what it appears to be, that is value or price of labour. It is, on the contrary, a masked form of the value or price of labour power. “Thereby,” writes Marx, “the whole hitherto existing bourgeois conception of wage as well as the criticism directed against it (hitherto) was once and for all thrown overboard and it was clearly shown that the wage labourer is permitted to work for his living, that is _to live_ in so far as he works gratis a certain time for the capitalist; that the whole capitalist system of production revolves around the prolongation of this unpaid labour (_Gratisarbeit_) through the extension of the working day or through the development of productivity, intensity of labour etc. and that the system of wage labour is a system of slavery and, indeed, a slavery which becomes more severe to the same extent as the social productive powers develop, whether the labourer receives a higher or a lower wage” (emphasis in text).[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n6) As to the conception of wage itself Marx is here restating in an extremely condensed form what he had written in _Capital_ I (Chapter 16, Chapter 19 in the French version) (“On the transformation of value, respectively price of labour power in wages”). There he had shown that as regards the “value and price of labour” or wage as the “phenomenal form” in contrast to the “essential relation” which is manifested therein, that is value and price of labour power, the same distinction holds as that between all phenomenal forms and their hidden substratum. He added that it had taken a long time for the world history to decipher the secret of wage, which was in fact Marx’s own achievement.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n7)

### Distribution in the New Society

Coming to the question of distribution in the “cooperative society,” Marx restates his two well-known fundamental materialist propositions. First, the juridical relations arise from the “economic,” that is production relations and not inversely, and, secondly, the distribution of the means of consumption is a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production, which in its turn is a character of the mode of production itself. Thus Marx faults the “programme” for limiting its scope exclusively to the distribution of the means of consumption among the members of the new society. “Vulgar socialism,” following the bourgeois economists, treats distribution — basically of the means of consumption — independently of the mode of production and presents socialism as turning exclusively on distribution.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n8)

As the ‘Programme’ spoke of the distribution of society’s labour-product, Marx’s approach to distribution in his critique was correspondingly directed against the Lassallean approach in terms of distribution of society’s total product, and not explicitly in terms of the broader question, that of allocation of society’s labour time. However, already earlier, in his 1857-58 manuscripts, Marx had emphasized that “all economy is finally reduced to the economy of time” and spoken of the two aspects of the employment of society’s available labour time. First, society’s labour time must be economised — less time society requires to produce the daily requirements, more time it gains for other material and spiritual production. Secondly, society must distribute its labour time among different branches appropriately in order to obtain production corresponding to its needs. However, on the basis of collective production the economy of time as well as planned distribution of labour time among different branches of production remains the first economic law. This becomes even a law of much higher degree.” Marx immediately adds that this is essentially different from measuring exchange values (labour or labour products) by labour time” (1953: 89).[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n9) In _Capital_ I (Chapter one) Marx offers an outline of the mode of distribution of the total social product within the “union of free individuals” without yet distinguishing between the different phases through which the new society is supposed to pass. However, in the light of the _Gothakritik_ where (in fact the only place where) Marx distinguishes between two phases of communism, the mode of distribution of the social product under communism as he proposes in _Capital_ I as well as in the manuscript for _Capital_ II (Chapter 18 in Engels’s edition) could only refer to the “first phase” of the new society. What we find particularly in _Capital_ I would only be elaborated in the _Gothakritik_. According to the earlier text, a part of the total social product is not distributed among the individual members but is kept aside for serving again as means of production. The rest serves as means of consumption distributed according to the magnitude of labour time that each producer contributes to the total social labour time. Here the labour time that each individual offers towards the creation of the social product corresponding to different needs of society, serves as the measure of the share of the labouring individual in the common labour as well as the portion of the total consumption which comes back to the labouring individual.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n10) An important purpose of Marx’s elaboration of this scheme in the _Gothakritik_ was the refutation of the Lassallean notion of distribution allowing each individual labourer the “undiminished fruit” of her or his labour (taken over by Lassalle from the earlier socialists including Proudhon). Following the lead of _Capital_ I Marx discusses in the _Gothakritik_ two basic aspects of the distribution of the social product mainly with reference to the society’s “first phase” — namely, the division of the product between society’s production needs and consumption needs, and secondly, the allotment of the means of consumption among society’s members.

As to the first problem, one part of the social product serves as common funds that include replacement and extension of the means of production as well as society’s insurance and reserve funds against uncertainty. The rest serves as means of collective consumption and personal consumption.

As to the mode of distribution of the means of consumption, as producers are united with the conditions of production in the new society, they are, to start with, no longer sellers of their labour power, and the wage form of return to their labour ceases right from the “first phase.” Here the labourers receive from their own (free) Association not wage but some kind of a token indicating the labour time contributed by them to the total social labour time — after deduction for common funds. These tokens allow the labourers to draw from the social stock of means of consumption the amount costing the same amount of labour.

At no stage, however, of the allocation-distribution process does the product of labour take the value form. Right from the start the new society — as it has “just come out of the capitalist society” — based on the common appropriation of the conditions of production excludes, by definition, all exchange in value form of the objectified labour against objectified labour as well as of the objectified labour against living labour. As the _Gothakritik_ says, “Within the cooperative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products, just as little does labour applied to the products appear _as value_ of these products” (emphasis in text).[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n11) Indeed, in the de-alienated Association there is no need for, in fact no possibility of, products of individual labour to be mediated by exchange in value form in order to be what they really are, that is _social_. Earlier Marx had written that in the communitarian society where “community is posited before production,” the “individual’s participation in the collective products is not mediated by independent labour or products of labour. It is mediated by the social conditions of production within which the individual’s activity is inserted” (1953: 89; 1958: 27). Naturally, in the absence of commodity production the tokens, that the producers receive from their association, indicating the labour time contributed by them to the total social product, are not money.

In the “first phase” of the new society the right of the individual producers to receive consumption goods proportional to the labour contributed by them (after necessary deductions) is an “equal right” in the sense that the measurement involved is done with an “equal standard,” labour, though the equal right is, at the same time, “unequal,” given the unequal contribution of the individual producers. In so far as a given amount of labour in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labour in another form, the _principle_ here involved is the same as that which prevails under commodity production, even though commodity production has ceased to exist.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n12) Since the new society has just come out of the capitalist society and has not yet been able to “develop on its own foundations,” the new mode of distribution cannot be completely free from the old mode. The determining principle of distribution among individuals continues to be each one’s labour contribution, and not (yet) human _needs_, this equal-unequal right being thus still within the bourgeois horizon, it is a “bourgeois right.” The latter is fully overcome only in a “higher phase” of the Association with the overcoming of the enslaving division of labour, with labour becoming a “first need” of life and with the “spring of cooperative wealth” flowing more abundantly.

### A Manifesto of Emancipation

While elaborating on the hitherto existing human labour as enslaving Marx, in the _Gothakritik_, also suggests that the situation has now arisen where conditions of negating this labour with the corresponding division of labour have been created. “Finally,” adds Marx, “in the modern capitalist society the material etc. conditions are created which enable and compel the labourers to break this malediction.”[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n13) The _Gothakritik_ gave Marx the occasion — though not for prescribing “receipts for the cook shops of the future” (1962a: 25) for at least offering some broad indicators regarding how he conceived the new society to be after the demise of the old. Let it be emphasized at the outset that for Marx the socialist (equivalently communist) society is nothing short of a “union of free individuals” because for him the (self) emancipation of the “wage slaves” automatically implies human emancipation in general inasmuch as in capitalism — the last antagonistic social formation in human evolution here is no class below the proletariat.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n14) The “associated mode of production” on which the new society is based and the corresponding collective (social) appropriation of the conditions of production stand opposed to all earlier modes of production and appropriation appearing in what Marx famously calls the “pre-history of human society” (1958: 14). Marx calls the new society the “union of free individuals” (1962a: 92) because the individuals here are _free_ in the sense that in the social relations of production, the ensemble of which constitutes the basis of a society, there is no longer any “personal dependence” — the first social form of unfreedom — as in pre-capitalism nor any “material dependence"- the second social form of unfreedom — as in the commodity (capitalist) production. In fact long before the arrival of the new society, capital tends to destroy all bonds of personal dependence such as are found in patriarchy, in the relations of the feudal lord and vassal, in those of the landlord and serf, in the system of casts and class etc. However, while capital destroys personal dependence, it establishes in its turn material dependence. “Under capital personal independence is based on material dependence.” This is shown in (generalized) commodity production (including wage labour). This “(personal) freedom is an illusion and is more correctly considered as indifference.” While the determining factor in the pre-capitalist case appears to be the “personal limitation” of one individual by another, the determining factor in the (generalized) commodity production (capitalism) is built-up into a “material limitation” of the individual by circumstances that are independent of the individual and over which the individual has no control. “The social production is not subordinated to the individuals. The individuals remain subordinated to the social production which exists outside of them as a fatality” (Marx 1953: 76, 81).[[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n15) Naturally, in the _Gothakritik_, focusing particularly on the post bourgeois society, Marx leaves aside the question of the first social form of unfreedom and refers only to the second social form of unfreedom embodied in commodity production and wage labour, neither of which has any place in socialism (communism) conceived as a society of free and associated producers.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n16) After the disappearance of the two social forms of unfreedom, the humanity arrives, in socialism, at “free individuality based on the universal development of the individual and the subordination of their common social productivity as their (own) social power” (Marx 1953: 75).

Commodity production and wage labour — besides the earlier forms of personal dependence — are not the only enemies of human freedom. There is also the institution of the state which was always considered by Marx as antipathetic to human freedom. “The existence of the state and the existence of slavery are inseparable,” he already announced in an early polemic (1976a: 401-402). A little later Marx wrote that “the working class in course of its development will substitute the old civil society by an association which will exclude classes and their antagonism, and there will no more be (any) political power properly speaking” (1965: 136), and one year later in the _Manifesto_ he (and Engels) added that with “production concentrated in the hands of the associated individuals, public power will lose its political character” (1966b: 77). Much later, only four years before he composed the _Gothakritik_, he praised the Parisian communards for their “Revolution not against this or that state power ... but against the _state_ itself” (in Marx and Engels 1971: 152, emphasis in text). So, it should be clear that for Marx, after the demise of the proletarian political power along with the proletariat at the end of the revolutionary transformation period” and the consequent disappearance of classes, the state, like commodity production and wage labour — embodying human unfreedom — can have no place in socialism. However, unlike what he does with commodity production and wage labour, Marx does not, in the _Gothakritik_, directly treat the question of the state in relation to the Association. He simply wonders about which _social_ functions would remain in the communist society _analogous_ to the present day state functions. That this is no way implies the continued existence of the state in the new society is clear in Marx’s denunciation, in the same document, of the “Lassallean sect’s servile faith in the state,” which he considers as “remote from socialism.”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/paresh-chattopadhyay/article.htm#n17)

Let us conclude by noting that Marx’s _Gothakritik_ did not have much luck with his followers at any period. Its emancipatory message was too strong for the immediate followers to take. The text was suppressed for a long period before being published by Marx’s followers (at the insistence of Engels) more than fifteen years after its composition. Even after it was published, its reception by the ‘Marxists’ was far from complete. We shall refer here to the best of the cases — to Lenin’s _State and Revolution_, perhaps the most libertarian work within ‘orthodox Marxism.’ this work apparently follows the _Gothakritik_ so closely that Lenin is said to have “built his whole _State and Revolution_ on it” (Dunayevskaya 1991: 154). On a careful reading of the book (undoubtedly incomplete), however, one finds that Lenin’s emancipatory idea falls far short of that of Marx (and Engels). Lenin conceives socialism — equated with the first phase of communism (contrary to Marx) — not in terms of new (_real_) _social relations_ of production, as a free association of producers based on the “associated mode of production,” but in terms of specific ownership (that is _juridical_) form, in terms of “social ownership” of the means of production, which is reduced to the ownership of the means of production by the “working class state.” While Lenin apparently excludes commodity production from socialism, he envisages “equality of labour and wage” for all citizens, now transformed into the “hired employees of the state” — in other words, the existence of wage labour and its employment by the (socialist) state. On the other hand, reading his own ideas into Marx’s text, Lenin envisages the existence of “bourgeois state” to enforce what Marx calls the (remaining) “bourgeois right” in distribution in the first phase of communism. This seems to be a strange logic — absolutely unwarranted by Marx’s text — which stands Marx on his head. In Marx the first phase of the new society is inaugurated _after_ the disappearance of the proletarian rule (along with the proletariat) — that is, all class rule. If Lenin is correct, the workers themselves — no longer proletarians — would have to _recreate_ a _bourgeois state_ to enforce “bourgeois right.” On the other hand, according to Marx, the existence of state itself — bourgeois or proletarian — ends along with the classes at the end of the “revolutionary transformation period” and the beginning of the new society. Whatever “bourgeois right” remains in the sphere of distribution, it does not require a particular _political_ apparatus — a _state_ (least of all a bourgeois state) — to enforce it. Quite logically Marx envisages _society_ itself distributing not only the labour tokens among its members, but also the total (social) labour time among the different branches of production. Indeed, Lenin’s socialism — particularly if we take his other writings into consideration as well — turns out to be much closer to Lassalle-Kautsky state owned-and-planned economy than to Marx’s emancipatory project of the “union of free individuals.” Let us add that Lenin’s inability to break altogether with the heritage of the Second International on the state appears also in his (mis)reading of Marx’s discourse on the commune (1871). About a month before the Bolshevik seizure of power (1917), Lenin wrote: “Marx taught ... that the proletariat must smash the ready-made state machine and substitute a new one for it ... This new machine was created by the Paris Commune.” We earlier saw how Marx spoke admiringly about the Parisian Revolution aiming to destroy the _state as such_, not simply a particular kind of state. In fact, ‘substituting the existing state machine by a new state machine (as Lenin would have it) was precisely considered by Marx to be the hallmark of all _earlier_ revolutions, not of the proletarian revolution whose aim _a contrario_ is to “throw off this deadening “incubus” altogether in course of the revolution. In Marx’s view, the Paris Commune, far from ‘creating a new state machine,’ aimed to destroy the machine itself.

### Endnotes

1. “As the creator of use values, as useful labor, labor is the condition of existence of the human, independent of all social forms, an everlasting natural necessity, for mediating the material exchange between the human and nature .... The human can only proceed in production as nature itself, that is, can only change the forms of matter. Still more. In this labor of simple transformation, the human is again constantly supported by forces of nature. Labour is thus not the unique source of the produced use values, the material wealth” (1962a: 57-58; 1965: 570-71, the term “_Formung_” (formation) in the German version was changed into “transformation” in the French version).

2. Quite in the spirit of the _Gothakritik_ Marx writes in an earlier text: “As if the division of labor would not be just as much possible if the conditions of labor belonged to the associated laborers and they act in relation to them as these are in nature, their own products and the material elements of their own activity” (1962b: 271).

3. “The proposition that the ‘natural,’ that is normal price of labour power coincides with the minimum wage, that is exchange value of the subsistence absolutely necessary for the life and reproduction of the labourer — this proposition I established for the first time in the _Outline_ (1844) and _The Condition_ (1845). It was later adopted by Marx. Lassalle borrowed it from us ... In _Capital_ Marx corrected this proposition while analysing the conditions that allow the capitalists to lower more and more the price of labour power below its value” (Engels in Marx 1972b: 83).

4. For a thorough discussion of the roots of the Lassallean iron law of wages in Ricardo and Malthus as well as of Marx’s fundamental difference with the Ricardo-Malthus-Lassalle approach see the unjustly neglected work of K. Diehl (1905: 5-7; 62-65; 70-860.

5. Marx elaborates this: “since the _real_ (_wirkliche_) labour of appropriating the natural elements for satisfying human needs is the activity through which the material exchange between the human and nature is mediated, the labour power which is denuded of the means of production, the objective conditions of appropriating the natural elements through labour, is also denuded of the _means of subsistence_. Therefore the labour power denuded of the means of production and of the means of subsistence is the absolute poverty as such and the labourer is its personification” (1976b: 35; emphasis in text).

6. Almost two decades earlier, in a letter to Engels (January 14, 1958), Marx had rejected the bourgeois theory of profit in almost the same terms, saying that “I have thrown overboard (_über den Haufen geworfen_) the whole doctrine of profit as it had existed hitherto” (helped by his rereading of Hegel’s _Logic_ “by mere accident”). With the whole bourgeois conception of wage and doctrine of profit gone, one wonders what remains of the claim that Marx was a Ricardian — albeit a critical one — after all.

7. To note in this connection is Marx’s use of the well-known Hegelian distinction between “essence” and “being” and the discussion around it as we find in the opening lines of the second book of _Logic_. (See Hegel 1963: 1). Marx repeats this almost verbatim in the _Gothakritik_ by emphasizing that Lassalle had taken “appearance for essence” in his (mis)understanding of wage. By the way this also disproves Althusser’s contention that the _Gothakritik_ is “totally free from any trace of the influence of Hegel” (1969: 21).

8. Marx credits Ricardo for having “instinctively conceived distribution as the most definite expression” of the relations of the “agents of production in a given society” (1953: 8; 1992: 895; 1964: 885). This way of conceiving distribution, even “instinctively” (that is, not consciously and explicitly), seems to have disappeared in the post-Ricardian bourgeois political economy. Marx particularly mentions John Stuart Mill for having conceived distribution independently of the mode of production, for considering the “bourgeois forms of production as absolute, but the bourgeois forms of distribution as relative, historical” (1962b: 80; 1992; 895; 1964: 885). The tendency of treating distribution in abstraction from the mode of production has continued in bourgeois political economy. This is clearly seen in Sen (1997).

9. In this regard see also Marx’s letters to Engels, January 8, 1868 and to Kugelman, July 11, 1968.

10. In the “union of free individuals,” Marx observes, “the labour time would play a double role. Its socially planned distribution regulates the correct proportion of the different functions of labour in relation to different needs. On the other hand, the labour time serves simultaneously as the measure of the individual share of the producers in the common labour and thereby also in the individual share of consumption in the common produce” (1962a: 93; 1965: 613. In the French version the term “planned” (plannässige) before the term “distribution” was left out.

11. In fact this had always been Marx’s position. The texts in this regard are too numerous to be cited here. There exists no text which contradicts this position. The contrary position — that according to Marx commodity production continues in socialism — taken by a number of authors, Marxist and non-Marxist, including some adherents of the so-called market socialism or socialist market, is based on a complete misreading of Marx’s texts (See, among others, Dobb 1940: 299-300; Lange 1945: 128; J. Robinson 1963: 23; Lukács 1971: 688; Schweickert 1996: 339-40).

12. In _Capital_ I Marx had invoked the principle of commodity exchange in this connection “just to draw a parallel” with commodity production without implying in any way that the communist society (even in its “first phase”) is a commodity society (1962a: 93; 1965: 613).

13. In an earlier text Marx observes: “The development of the faculties of the human species, though at first effected at the cost of the majority of the human individuals and even of the whole classes of human beings, ends up by breaking through this antagonism and coincides with the development of the singular individuals. Thus a higher development of individuality is brought only through a historic process in which the individuals are sacrificed” (1959: 107).

14. “The proletariat,” wrote the young Marx, “cannot abolish its own conditions of existence without abolishing the inhuman conditions of the present society which are summed up in its own situation (1972a: 38) Again, in his last programmatic writing for the working class he penned: “The emancipation of the working class is the emancipation of all human beings irrespective of sex or race” (1965: 1538).

15. Earlier he had written that in the exchange process “the individual’s own power over the object appears as power of the object over the individual; master of his production, the individual appears as the slave of his production” (1932: 526).

16. The second social form of human unfreedom inherent in commodity production, including wage labour, seems not to have been recognized by the eminent humanist and libertarian economist A.K. Sen. While he rightly stresses the liberating aspect of commodity production (“market”) for the individuals in a largely pre-capitalist environment and correctly refers to Marx in this connection, he fails to notice the enslaving side of commodity production itself in relation to the participating individuals (even in ‘perfect’ market situation) precisely emphasized by Marx. Sen, of course, does not question the wage system either, denounced by Marx as “wage slavery.” See Sen 1999.

17. The “present day state” is brought in by Marx as simply an _analogy_ in the same way as Marx, while discussing the mode of distribution of the means of consumption in socialism, brings in commodity production “just to give a parallel” (1962a: 93). In no way follows that either the state or commodity production would continue to prevail in the Association. Let us add that in his (probably) last theoretical writing Marx sarcastically mentions the “Social State” ascribed to him by somebody “generously” (1962c: 360-371).

#### 1 The ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’ in Marx and Engels

The phrase ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ first appeared in a series of articles by Marx, later titled _The Class Struggles in France 1848-1850,_ published in what was then Marx’s own London magazine. The first article, written in January 1850, came off the press in early March. The expression or its equivalent appeared not once but three times – in each of the three installments (or chapters) that comprised the original series.

This work was Marx’s attempt to sum up the political meaning of the European revolution of 1848-49. Marx had taken an active part in this revolution in the German arena, as editor of the leading organ on the revolutionary left, at the same time closely following the turbulent developments in France and Vienna in particular. The revolution was now over, and Marx was thinking over its lessons.

The first question is: when it appeared in print in the spring of 1850, what did the phrase mean to Marx and to his contemporaneous readers?

The key fact, which was going to bedevil the history of the term, is this: in the middle of the nineteenth century the old word ‘dictatorship’ still meant what it had meant for centuries, and in this meaning it was _not_ a synonym for despotism, tyranny, absolutism, or autocracy, and above all it was _not_ counterposed to democracy.

##### 1. Short Sketch of ‘Dictatorship’

The word ‘dictatorship’ in all languages _(dictature, Diktatur,_ etc.) began as a reference to the _dictatura_ of the ancient Roman Republic, an important constitutional institution that lasted for over three centuries and left its enduring mark on all political thought. This institution provided for an emergency exercise of power by a trusted citizen for temporary and limited purposes, for six months at the most. Its aim was to preserve the republican status quo; it was conceived to be a bulwark in defense of the republic against a foreign foe or internal subversion; indeed it was directed against elements whom we might today accuse of wanting “dictatorship.” It worked – at least until Julius Caesar destroyed the republican _dictatura_ by declaring himself unlimited “dictator” in permanence, that is, a dictator in our present-day sense.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n1)

The modern analogue of the Roman _dictatura_ is the institution of martial law (or “state of siege”). This device has the three distinguishing features of the Roman one: it is based on constitutional legality, not tyranny; it is temporary; it is limited, especially in its ability to impose new laws or constitutions. Again and again, institutions of the martial-law type have provided for some form of crisis government or emergency regime. Few claim that these institutions are _ipso facto_ antidemocratic, though of course they can be perverted to antidemocratic uses like everything else.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n2)

The old meaning conditioned all European political thought and language right into the nineteenth century, though the application of the term tended to blur in some respects. Most consistently it kept referring to an emergency management of power, especially outside of normal legality. The one-man aspect of its meaning was sometimes primary, but it was often muffled, particularly by rightists attacking the dominance of a popularly elected body.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n3)

In the French Revolution – like all revolutions a bubbling cauldron of political terminology – the Girondins liked to denounce the “dictatorship of the National Convention” (the zenith of revolutionary democracy at the time) or the “dictatorship of the Commune of Paris” (the most democratic expression yet seen of a mass movement from below).[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n4) For over a century no one would blink when the British Parliament was attacked as a “dictatorship” on the ground that it held all power, though this usage dropped even the crisis-government aspect of the term.

The history of ‘dictatorship’ on the left begins with the very first socialist-communist movement, the first fusion of the socialistic idea with membership organization: the so-called “Conspiracy of the Equals” led by Babeuf in 1796, in the backwash of the failed French Revolution. In an influential book published in 1828, Babeuf’s lieutenant Buonarroti described the activity and politics of this movement in some detail, thereby producing a textbook of Jacobin-communist politics that helped educate (and miseducate) the “Blanquist” leftists of the next two decades. (It was quickly published in English by left Chartists.)

Buonarroti described the conspirators’ discussion on the transitional revolutionary government to take power after victory. While eschewing the term ‘dictatorship’ because of its one-man meaning, he left no doubt that the revolutionary government was to be the dictatorship of the small band making the revolution, which had the task of educating the people up to the level of eventual democracy. This concept of Educational Dictatorship was going to have a long future before it. There was not the slightest question of a ‘dictatorship’ of, or by, the working-people, corrupted as they were by the exploitive society to be overthrown. The revolutionary band of idealistic dictators alone would exercise the transitional dictatorship, for an unspecified period of time, at least a generation.[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n5)

This was also the entire content of the concept of dictatorship held by Auguste Blanqui and the Blanquist bands of the thirties and forties. In addition, the Blanquists (and not only they) advocated the “dictatorship of Paris” over the provinces and the country as a whole – which meant, above all, over the peasants and the rural artisanry; for had not the provinces shown in the Great Revolution that they tended toward counterrevolution? In the name of The People, the revolutionary saviors would defend the revolution against the people.

Incidentally, the ascription of the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ to Blanqui is a myth industriously copied from book to book by marxologists eager to prove that Marx was a putschist “Blanquist,” but in fact all authorities on Blanqui’s life and works have (sometimes regretfully) announced that the term is not to be found there. More important, the concept of political power exercised by the democratic masses is basically alien to the Blanquist idea of Educational Dictatorship.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n6)

By the nineteenth century political language had long included references to the “dictatorship” of the most democratic assemblies, of popular mass movements, or even of The People in general. All Marx did at the time was apply this old political term to the political power of a _class._

But Marx’s usage in 1850 was significantly conditioned not merely by the long history of the word but particularly by its history in the revolutionary period he had just passed through.

##### 2. ‘Dictatorship’ in the 1848 Revolution

Revolutions are by nature periods of crisis management and emergency power, in which the old legalities totter or tumble. This is true on both sides, for counterrevolutions are no greater respecters of legality. The revolution of 1848 saw the imposition of a “dictatorship,” that of General Cavaignac, which was the herald of its modern history. But the necessity of some sort of dictatorship (in the terminology of the day) was recognized on all sides and freely discussed by the most disparate political tendencies from right to left.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n7)

The essential meaning of ‘dictatorship’ at this time can be seen best in the case of Louis Blanc, one of the pinkest social-democrats in the early history of the movement. He constituted the left wing of the provisional government that took power in the February Revolution. This government naturally assumed power extralegally, through an announcement before a mass demonstration. Even Lamartine, its right-wing leader who was anxious to lead the revolution into conservative channels, called himself and his colleagues “dictators” for this reason. Louis Blanc _advocated_ the continuance of the “dictatorship,” through the postponement of elections, in order to allow for a period of re-education of the people. Not only at the time but in a book published ten years later, Blanc advocated that the provisional government should “regard themselves as dictators appointed by a revolution which had become inevitable and which was under no obligation to seek the sanction of universal suffrage until after having accomplished all the good which the moment required.” Blanc not only wanted a longer postponement than did the revolutionary workers’ clubs of Paris, he also advocated the old idea of the “dictatorship of Paris” over the country.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n8)

Obviously ‘dictatorship’ was not the property of “extremists” and wild-eyed revolutionaries. Far from being counterposed to democracy, it was viewed – favorably or hostilely – as an aspect of the movement of the Democracy.

Everyone had his own idea of what the proper sort of ‘dictatorship’ should be. Wilhelm Weitling had long advocated a messianic dictatorship with himself as the messiah, and in 1848 he openly advocated a dictatorship with a “single head”; a couple of weeks later, Marx attacked and rejected Weitling’s proposal in the same forum that Weitling had used.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n9) Bakunin, involved in the revolutionary movement in Bohemia, later recounted that his aim was the establishment of a “government with unlimited dictatorial power,” in which “all will be subjugated to a single dictatorial authority,” through three secret societies based on “strict hierarchy and unconditional discipline.” This was only the first version of Bakunin’s lifelong fabrication of various forms of a “secret dictatorship” exercised by “Invisible Dictators.”[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n10)

These concepts of ‘dictatorship’ (and others) were plainly antidemocratic, just as most concepts of ‘government’ were anti-democratic. But, like the word ‘government,’ ‘dictatorship’ could be filled with various contents, denoting some extralegal sort of emergency regime; and it was. In the “June days” of 1848, when the Paris working class erupted in the greatest revolt that modern history had yet seen, the panic-stricken provisional government replied by entrusting the power of military “dictatorship” to General Cavaignac, who used it for an educational bloodletting on a mass scale even after the fighting was over. (The term ‘dictatorship’ was not used officially, but was common in the press and on everyone’s tongue; the official term was “state of siege.”)

To be sure, Cavaignac’s dictatorship was not a modern dictatorship, but it was the prelude to the modern history of the term. It provided the juridical basis for the state-of-siege provision put into the French constitution of November 1848, which in turn led to the law of August 9, 1849, still in force in the twentieth century as the basic law of “constitutional dictatorship” in France. It provided the model for martial-law institutions in Berlin and Vienna later in 1848. It cleared the way for the dictatorship of Napoleon III, which did not call itself a dictatorship but merely the Second Empire. It made dictatorship a European institution.[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n11)

During this revolution Marx was the dominant figure on the extreme left of the revolution in Germany, as editor of the _Neue Rheinische Zeitung_ in Cologne. Like everyone else, the _N. R. Z._ referred to dictatorship. But the first mention of ‘dictatorship’ in its columns was not by Marx but occurred in a quotation from the head of the provisional government that had taken power in the revolution behind the mass surge of revolt – and which was determined to prevent the revolution from overthrowing the Crown and its absolutist government. The prime minister, Camphausen, a Rhenish capitalist, strenuously argued that if the provisional government and its assembly took sovereign power in the name of the popular rule, this would be a “dictatorship” – the dictatorship of the Democracy indeed. If the new government democratized the elite system of voting, this would be dictatorship too.

Now the main line championed by Marx’s _N.R.Z._ was the simple proposal that the National Assembly declare itself sovereign, repudiating the absolutist government and appealing to the people. No one doubted that this raised the question of revolutionary legality. That is what revolutions are for. The term ‘dictatorship’ on all sides simply reflected this problem, as Camphausen had exemplified by his attack on the dictatorship of the Democracy. It was in this context that the _N.R.Z._ advocated that the ‘dictatorship’ of the popular assembly put through a whole series of democratizing measures to revolutionize Germany’s autocratic society. Marx wrote:

Every provisional state setup after a revolution requires a dictatorship, and an energetic dictatorship at that. From the beginning we taxed Camphausen with not acting dictatorially, with not immediately smashing and eliminating the remnants of the old institutions.

There was no question of a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ here because Marx’s policy in this revolution was to champion the initial assumption of power not by the working-class movement (which was just getting organized) but by the liberal bourgeoisie, whose historical task it was (as Marx then saw it) to uproot the old regime of Crown-bureaucracy-feudalists and establish a bourgeois democratic society, in which the proletariat could develop its own movement and its own class struggle looking toward eventual victory. But the German bourgeoisie, in large part precisely because it saw a revolutionary proletariat pressing behind it, refused to play out this drama, and instead clung to the absolutist government’s power as its bulwark against the future proletarian threat.

The most important lesson that Marx learned from the revolutionary experience was that the German bourgeoisie could not be relied on to make its _own_ revolution, the bourgeois democratic revolution which would eventually lay the basis for the proletarian socialist revolution. The two tasks would have to be telescoped, unlike the pattern that France had exemplified. A German revolution would have to be pushed forward and still forward, from stage to stage, pressing leftward, until power could be taken by the extreme left, the revolutionary proletariat. This is, the concept which Marx summarized as “permanent (that is, ongoing or continuous) revolution,” “a revolution which does not come to a halt until the proletariat has taken power.” It is this conclusion that introduced the question of proletarian power (or, same thing, proletarian ‘dictatorship’) into Marx’s writings of 1850 analyzing the defeated revolution.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n12)

##### 3. The Fear of the ‘Dictatorship’ of the People

For decades Europe lay in the shadow of the defeated revolution. In the words of the _Communist Manifesto,_ the ruling classes had trembled before the specter of a Communist revolution, and one of the lesser consequences fell on their mode of language. Above all, talk of the threatened (and just averted), “dictatorship” or “despotism” of the people became journalistic commonplace. Of course the idea of the “despotism of the people” goes back to Plato’s and Aristotle’s horror of democracy as a threat to established society; but in the 1850s this fear became pandemic.

The London _Times_ thundered against giving the vote to the majority of the people on the ground that this would in effect disenfranchise “the present electors” by making the lower classes “supreme.” Manchester capitalists denounced a strike as “the tyranny of Democracy.” The liberal Tocqueville, writing in 1856 about the Great French Revolution, regretted that it had been carried through by “the masses on behalf of the sovereignty of the people” instead of by an “enlightened autocrat”; the revolution was a period of “popular” dictatorship, he wrote. It was perfectly clear that the “dictatorship” he lamented was the establishment of “popular sovereignty.”[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n13)

In 1849 Guizot, the last prime minister to serve under a French king, published an interesting book, _On Democracy in France._ In a great passage, the historian-statesman complained: everyone claims to be for democracy nowadays, including monarchists and republicans as well as leftists; but democracy means chaos, class war, and popular despotism. Popular despotism means that the people impose their will over those classes which, though a minority, have the mission of ruling society. The newfangled notion that sovereignty should flow from elections is totally un-French. “Popular tyranny or military dictatorship may be the expedient of a day, but can never be a form of government.”

Guizot assumed what everyone knew: democracy meant All Power to the People. This meant the dictatorship of the people. This dictatorship he was against.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n14)

Early in the same year, a Spanish conservative became famous all over Europe for a speech made in Spain’s parliament that said bluntly and even crudely what few others dared to put into words so frankly. Juan Donoso Cortés had been one of the Spanish political leaders who had helped put General Narvaez into power as a virtual dictator even before the European revolution had broken out. In his “Speech on Dictatorship,” Donoso had no compunction about asserting that power belonged in the hands of the propertied bourgeoisie by right of “intelligence” and by right of the saber. As for legality: ‘When legality suffices to save society, then legality. When it does not suffice, dictatorship.” Yes, he admitted, the word ‘dictatorship’ is a “fearful word,” but the word ‘revolution’ is “the most fearful of all.”

It was only a question of what kind of dictatorship you favored: “it is a question of choosing between the dictatorship of the insurrection and the dictatorship of the [present] government,” and _he_ chose the latter. Then came his high point:

It is a question of choosing between the dictatorship from below and the dictatorship from above: I choose the dictatorship from above, since it comes from a purer and loftier realm. It is a question of choosing, finally, between the dictatorship of the dagger and the dictatorship of the saber: I choose the dictatorship of the saber, since it is nobler.

The greatest dictatorship of all existed in England; for (mark this!) the British Parliament could do anything it wanted: “Who, gentlemen, has ever seen so colossal a dictatorship?” asked the Spanish reactionary triumphantly. It was something of an anticlimax for Donoso to reveal that God is a dictator also. This speech was quickly translated into many languages and published all over the world.[[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n15)

At the time, less attention was given to an important book on the European revolution published in 1850 by Lorenz von Stein, who eight years before had written one of the very first studies of the burgeoning of socialism in France. Stein’s analysis of “dictatorship” was complex, and cannot be summarized here; suffice it to say that he discussed it wholly in terms of class power, in particular in the context of the new proletariat’s class struggles. He saw the question of “dictatorship” in terms of Louis Blanc, whom he accepted as the spokesman of the French working class.

“Social dictatorship,” wrote Stein, “became the slogan of the proletariat” (meaning Blanc), “and popular representation the slogan of the Democracy and the property owners” (meaning the bourgeois democracy led by Lamartine). Louis Blanc’s followers, the social-democrats, could decide to “overthrow the government, replace it exclusively by Social Democrats, and therewith establish the rule of the proletariat.” The social-democrats’ idea of popular sovereignty became the idea that “a Provisional Government should uphold a dictatorship until it has carried out all measures it considers necessary.” “The struggle of the classes for control of the state was here clearly formulated.”

Aside from the fact that he took Louis Blanc’s rhetoric seriously, Stein presented the most sophisticated of the antirevolutionary analyses of the revolution. In some passages he seemed on the verge of using the very term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat,’ but it did not actually appear.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n16)

Marx went over the same ground, in his own way, but with much the same acceptance of the current vocabulary. Like Stein, Guizot, and everyone else, he not infrequently used ‘despotism’ in much the same way as ‘dictatorship’: in combinations like “class despotism” (applied to bourgeois-democratic regimes), “parliamentary despotism,” the industrial “despotism” of the factory, or the “despotic inroads on the rights of property” to be made by a workers’ state. The term ‘class despotism’ which he used quite often in the 1850s was virtually a variation on ‘class dictatorship.’[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n17)

In _Karl Marx’s Theory of Revolution_ 3, I have made a detailed survey of how the word ‘dictatorship’ occurs in the writings of Marx and Engels, but the conclusion is not startling: they used the term in ways as various as everyone else did in their day, particularly in metaphorical ways, many of which are still current. They might refer to the “intellectual dictatorship” of the medieval church, or of the popes; or to a financier as “dictator” of the Crédit Mobilier. The petty states of Germany were under the “dictatorship” of Prussia or Austria; the Berlin government submitted to a “Franco-Russian dictatorship”; all Europe was under a “Muscovite dictatorship”; and just as the referee is the dictator on a soccer field, so too it was standard for the editor of a daily newspaper to be called “dictator” of the press room, even though he was subordinate to owners. Marx exercised the same “dictatorship” as editor of the Cologne daily he put out during the hectic days of revolution in 1848-49.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n18)

The term ‘military dictator[ship]’ was less elastic; in fact, as far as I know, Marx and Engels never used this term about anyone or any regime toward which they felt kindly. I suspect this was true of the general usage too.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n19)

But on the other hand, Marx applied the term ‘dictator’ pejoratively to a number of political figures who exercised no dictatorship at all: in these cases the term merely stressed some sort of _domination_ in another form. Among these cases we find the Irish leader Parnell, Bismarck, Lord Palmerston, and a few others. This usage, fairly common in the press, should remind us of how often Franklin D. Roosevelt was called a “dictator” long after the meaning of the term had hardened.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n20)

More to the point are the cases where Marx or Engels attacked efforts toward personal domination inside the working-class or socialist movement; the word ‘dictatorship’ was indeed apt to crop up in the denunciation. The two best cases in point are those of Bakunin and Lassalle, both seekers after personal dictatorship inside the movement, and both attacked for this reason by Marx or Engels. Bakunin’s schemes for a “Secret Dictatorship” of his coterie (in the name of anarchist “libertarianism,” of course) were the basis of the Bakuninists’ drive to take over the International from about 1869 on; and by that time Marx came to understand that “This Russian evidently wants to become dictator of the European working-class movement.” The International published a brochure written mainly by Engels and Lafargue, exposing “the organization of a secret society with the sole aim of subjecting the European workers’ movement to the secret dictatorship of a few adventurers ...” This brochure, for years derogated by unreliable historians, has been confirmed in all essential respects by the accumulation of evidence on Bakunin’s dictatorial aspirations.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n21)

Ferdinand Lassalle was for several years defended by Marx _against_ the Communist club in the Rhineland which rejected Lassalle’s bid for membership. It is now known that Lassalle did not bother to conceal his “hankerings for dictatorship” of the workers’ movement, at least not from associates whom he regarded as inferiors. Marx found this out only in 1856. Then in an 1862 visit to Marx, Lassalle revealed more of his dictatorial ideas, his hostility to “individual liberty,” and his propensity for behaving “as if he were the future workers’ dictator.” Marx told him that they were poles apart, agreeing “on nothing except some far-distant ultimate ends,” and chaffed him as an “enlightened Bonapartist.” The accuracy of this assessment was fully confirmed when research turned up Lassalle’s attempt in 1863 to use the newly organized Lassallean social-democratic organization to make a deal with Bismarck: the Lassallean socialists would support a “social dictatorship” by the Crown in exchange for concessions. In this letter Lassalle pointed to his own personal “dictatorship” in the organization as evidence of the willingness of the “working class” to support dictatorship. The general nature of Lassalle’s machinations with Bismarck were known in the movement at the time, and were reported to Marx. It is hard to see why the myth of Marx’s “personal” hatred for Lassalle had to be invented to account for hostility to a man with such politics. [[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n22)

In a number of other cases Marx expressed his opinion on efforts at _personal_ dictatorship in the movement. Of Auguste Comte, whose sect called itself Positivist and was active in working-class circles, Marx wrote that he was a “prophet” of “personal _Dictatorship_” – “author of a new catechism with a new pope and new saints.” In England, where H. M. Hyndman founded a self-styled Marxist group, the Social Democratic Federation, his dictatorial conduct as boss of the organization was notorious. Hyndman, wrote Engels, had alienated associates particularly by “his impatience to play the dictator.” In what was left of the Chartist movement by 1855, Ernest Jones thought to stem decay by concentrating all organizational power in his own hands. Marx wrote the news to Engels that Jones “has proclaimed himself dictator of Chartism,” stirred a storm of indignation against himself, and showed himself an “ass” in his effort “to play the dictator himself.” [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n23)

These examples of the use of ‘dictatorship’ indicate the spectrum of meaning common in the nineteenth century. Indeed, much of this spectrum still conditions the term today; metaphorical uses are still common. But when Marx first wrote down the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat,’ it was a very specific sort of metaphorical usage.

##### 4. ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’: First Period

Quite early, by 1844, Marx came to the conclusion that, to achieve a communist transformation of society, the proletariat first had to conquer political power. This idea played a basic role for him, and various terms expressing it dot his writings: not only ‘conquest of political (or state) power,’ but ‘rule of the proletariat’ in particular; the outcome would be a ‘workers’ state’; in terms of the British movement, this meant ‘proletarian ascendancy.’ We are going to see that, under given circumstances, one of these terms was _also_ going to be ‘dictatorship of the proletariat.’ [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n24)

Marx recognized that this aim, the political ‘rule of the proletariat,’ was not at all unique to his own theory; on the contrary, he liked to stress that _all_ other real working-class movements set this as their goal. This is strongly stated in the _Communist Manifesto_: [[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n25)

The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: constitution of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of bourgeois rule, conquest of political power by the proletariat.

Above all, Marx knew and appreciated that the left Chartists (e.g., Harney) regularly advocated the “ascendancy” (or rule, or political power) of the proletariat. [[26]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n26) These Chartists, like Marx, had no trouble with the alleged problem raised by modern marxologists: _How can a whole class rule?_ The answer was the same for Marx and the Chartists as it was for their opponents, for (say) the liberal historian Macaulay, who feared universal suffrage on the ground that it would put “supreme power” in the hands of a class, the class of labor, hence generating a “despotism,” by which he openly meant a despotism over the bourgeoisie. [[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n27)

We are going to see, then, that Marx used the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ in exactly the same way as he used ‘rule of the proletariat’ and the other labels for a workers’ state. But under what circumstances did he tend to do so? A major clue is found in the fact that Marx’s and Engels’ use of the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ clustered in three periods and was in fact notably absent in between. These three periods were the following:

Period I: 1850 to 1852, the postrevolutionary period after the upheaval of 1848-1849.

Period II: 1871 to 1875, the postrevolutionary period after the Paris Commune.

Period III (naturally involving Engels only): a sort of echo from 1875.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n28)

In view of the career of the word ‘dictatorship,’ there is now no very difficult problem about Marx’s willingness to replace ‘rule’ with ‘dictatorship’ in certain contexts. But a review of these contexts is enlightening.

_Locus 1_. In the first chapter of his _Class Struggles in France,_ Marx mentioned that in the course of the revolution in France, “there appeared the bold slogan of revolutionary struggle: _Overthrow of the bourgeoisie! Dictatorship of the working class!”_ Since there is absolutely no record that “dictatorship of the proletariat” appeared as a slogan at all, I suggest that Marx is not saying here that _it_ appeared; he is only placing it in apposition with the slogan that did appear, the first-mentioned slogan, namely “Overthrow of the bourgeoisie!” In effect he is explaining what the first-mentioned slogan meant. In the same passage, by the way, Marx freely used “bourgeois terrorism” and “bourgeois dictatorship” interchangeably with bourgeois “rule” to characterize the “bourgeois republic. [[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n29)

In the second chapter, Marx mentioned that the proletariat was not yet sufficiently developed to take power itself. “the proletariat ... [was] not yet enabled through the development of the remaining classes to seize the revolutionary dictatorship ...” In writing this, Marx, as often, excluded the idea of a seizure of power by a minority in the Blanquist fashion.[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n30)

In the third chapter (written in March 1850 and published in April) Marx dissected the pink socialism of Louis Blanc and reported that as against such social-democratic reform currents, “the _proletariat_ increasingly organizes itself around _revolutionary socialism,_ around _communism,_ for which the bourgeoisie itself has invented the name of _Blanqui_.” It is important to note what this clearly states: Blanqui’s name was inventively applied to the communist tendency by its enemies, the bourgeoisie – and not by Marx himself.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n31)

Marx’s chapter goes on to say that this revolutionary socialism “is the _declaration of the permanence of the revolution,_ the _class dictatorship_ of the proletariat as the necessary transit point to the _abolition of class distinctions generally_” and thence to the revolutionizing of all society. Please note that Marx’s emphasis is on the term ‘class dictatorship.’

Marx’s reference to Blanqui is a shorthand reference to the then well-known use of Blanqui’s name as a revolutionary bogey by the counterrevolutionary politicians. At a crucial point in April 1848, when a workers’ demonstration against the government was building up, the right-wing Provisional Government leaders organized a massive campaign to circulate the story that Blanqui and his friends were preparing to overthrow the government and take over. (One of the first well-organized “red scares.”)

_Karl Marx’s Theory of Revolution_ 3 gives some space to Louis Blanc’s own historical account of the use made of Blanqui’s “name as a sort of bugbear.” Blanc referred to “the part so cleverly assigned to M. Blanqui, the better to frighten the bourgeoisie” – a role assigned, or invented, by the government majority anxious to put an end to revolutionary pressure from below. This is the meaning of Marx’s reference to the communist bugbear “for which the bourgeoisie itself has invented the name of Blanqui.” [[32]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n32)

The repeated claim that in this passage Marx was himself equating the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ phrase with Blanqui is a remarkable distortion that is almost standard among marxologists, not infrequently based on outright mistranslation.[[33]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n33)

_Locus 2_. In April 1850 the phrase ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ again cropped up, _in connection with_ the Blanquists but not as their expression.

At this time, still expecting that the quiescent revolution would burst out again on the Continent, Marx and his comrades of the Communist League, in London exile, looked for cooperative relations with other revolutionary groups. One of these was the left wing of the Chartists, led by Harney, already in close touch with Marx’s circle. Among the French, the only group Marx considered to be revolutionary was the Blanquist tendency, which had no prominent leaders and few ideas but did have some influence in the emigré community. Talks took place among these three tendencies looking toward the establishment of a sort of united-front organization for revolutionary cooperation. A number of programmatic points were jotted down – not by Marx or Engels – for consideration under the heading “Société Universelle des Communistes Révolutionnaires.” [The full story of SUCR is set out for the first time in Chapter 12 of _Karl Marx’s Theory of Revolution_ 3, which gives particular attention to the myths spun about SUCR by such writers as Nicolaievsky.]

All we really know of SUCR is that some sort of preliminary agreement was reached to discuss this proposal. All the participants signed the paper with the programmatic points. There is no evidence that any organization resulted. Indeed all the evidence indicates that the idea remained strictly on paper and never got off the ground. By October Marx – who had meanwhile come to the conclusion that the revolutionary situation was over for that period – repudiated the SUCR project.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n34)

For what it is worth, then, we can report that the SUCR program set down this article first of all: “The aim of the association is the downfall of all the privileged classes, to subject these classes to the dictatorship of the proletarians, maintaining the revolution in permanence until the realization of communism ...” [[35]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n35)

The “dictatorship of the proletarians” is a formula that Marx never used elsewhere; this is only one of several reasons to believe that the program was drafted not by Marx but by August Willich, a member of the Communist League close to the Blanquists personally.[[36]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n36) There is no mystery about why this phrase, as well as “revolution in permanence,” appealed to these people. The attractive appeal of these terms to Blanquist types who did not understand their content suggests a hypothesis on why, and under what circumstances, Marx occasionally used the term dictatorship of the proletariat.[[37]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n37)

The same hypothesis explains why the term makes its appearance _in connection with_ the Blanquists but not _by_ the Blanquists. Ordinarily Marx’s term for the idea would be, as we have seen, ‘rule of the proletariat,’ ‘political power of the working class,’ etc. _But when it is a question of counterposing this class concept to the Blanquist-type dictatorship, it is dressed in the formula ‘class dictatorship.’_ Class dictatorship is then counterposed to Blanquist dictatorship, to make the contrast.

Particularly in united fronts with the Blanquists, it was only such a formulation that would be acceptable to Marx. On its basis he could undertake to do what was necessary to re-educate his partners. Joint collaboration with these partners took place on a formulation that preserved the class character that was fundamental for Marx, while at the same time no doubt making the Blanquists happy with its revolutionary flavor.

To understand this, the reader must put aside the modern aura that makes ‘dictatorship’ a dirty word for us; for this aura did not yet exist. How do you counteract the primitive notion of dictatorship that was so common precisely among the people who wanted to be good revolutionaries? You tell them: _Dictatorship? That means rule. Yes, we want the rule of the proletariat; but that does not mean the rule of a man or a clique or a band or a party; it means the rule of a class. Class rule means class dictatorship_.

This is how the term came from Marx’s pen in 1850: an instrument in the re-education of the Blanquist and Jacobin-revolutionary currents around Marx’s own circle. The marxological myth which had ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ pegged as a “Blanquist” idea had history turned upside-down. ‘Dictatorship of the proletariat’ came into existence as an attempt to show would-be revolutionaries that there was _another_ way of being revolutionary, Marx’s way.

This understood, we can restate our basic thesis on the meaning of the term _to Marx._ For Marx and Engels, from beginning to end of their careers and without exception, ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ meant nothing more and nothing less than ‘rule of the proletariat,’ the ‘conquest of political power’ by the working class, the establishment of a workers’ state in the immediate postrevolutionary period.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n38)

The subsequent career of the term provides proof after proof of this thesis; at the same time no evidence turns up to gainsay it. This is the claim to be tested in the light of the facts.

##### 5. The First Period – Continued

The next appearances of the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ were echoes from Locus 1.

_Locus 3._ Otto Lüning, the socialistic editor of a leftist paper in Frankfurt, wrote a four-installment review of Marx’s _N.R.Z. Revue_ articles on _The Class Struggles in France._ It was published in June in Lüning’s _Neue Deutsche Zeitung_.[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n39) What Lüning criticized above all was the “red thread” that wound through Marx’s conception of society and history: “the cleavage of present-day society into different classes” with contradictory interests. Lüning’s kind of socialism believed in class harmony and reform. He therefore repeatedly underlined that Marx advocated the taking of political power by the working class: for Marx the aim of the revolutionary movement is “_the revolutionary rule, the dictatorship of the working class_.” But what Lüning keeps attacking is the “rule.” He finally reveals that his sharpest disagreement is with Marx’s emphasis on “the transference of rule from one class to another” _instead of_ on “the destruction of class differences.”

At no point did Lüning indicate any special interest in the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat,’ which he himself mentioned in passing. Throughout he was intent on repudiating the aim of a working-class state, of class rule, as well as (later in his review) attacking the very idea of a class interpretation of history. Obviously Lüning’s views had a great future as the format for anti-Marxism, but it was not ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ that drew blood.[[40]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n40)

Marx, who at first intended to write a longer analysis of Lüning for the N. R. Z. _Revue, compromised_ on a letter to the editor in the latter’s paper. Marx’s letter was short and sententious and replied only to Lüning’s claim that Marx had written _only_ about ‘rule of the proletariat’ and not about the further aim of abolishing class differences. It referred to the charge about “the rule and the dictatorship of the working class” but, just like Lüning, was interested only in the “rule” idea. The letter listed a series of references and citations to Marx’s writings in which the “abolition of class differences” had been prominently discussed, including the very passage that Lüning was reviewing.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n41)

What stands out, in Marx’s letter as in Lüning’s attack, was that the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ was not specially involved – for either of them. Both assumed that it had no special content other than ‘rule of the proletariat.’

_Locus 4._ Lüning’s associate editor and brother-in-law was a good friend and comrade of Marx’s, Joseph Weydemeyer. In 1851 Weydemeyer had to flee government harassment in Germany, and finally decided to emigrate to the United States. Soon after his arrival in November, he began writing for the radical German-American press, while corresponding with Marx. His first article appeared in the New York _Turn-Zeitung_ for January 1, 1852, an issue which also offered the first installment of Engels’ _Peasant War in Germany_ as well as Weydemeyer’s announcement of his own forthcoming weekly.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n42)

The title of Weydemeyer’s article was “Die Diktatur des Proletariats” (The Dictatorship of the Proletariat). The article was solely concerned with the subject of the _rule_ of the working class as expounded in the _Communist Manifesto,_ which is the source of the contents of the piece. The term in the title is not even repeated in the body of the article until the last passage, which speaks of the need for any revolution to have “a dictatorship at its head,” and then presents the idea of the dictatorship of “the proletariat which is concentrated in the big cities,” not the proletariat _tout court._ Obviously Weydemeyer did not grasp the idea of a class dictatorship, however many times Marx had underlined that term.

Now as he wrote an article condensing the teachings of the Man (as was clearly Weydemeyer’s aim), why did the title term occur to him? The answer, not very conjectural, is that he had only recently stood close on the sidelines as his associate Lüning had lifted a lance against “the rule, the dictatorship of the working class.”[[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n43)

Marx must have recently received a copy of Weydemeyer’s article (though there is no record of this) when on March 5, 1852, in response to his friend’s letters, Marx wrote him a lengthy bit of advice on how to deal with issues in the German-American press. It was in this context that Marx criticized the refusal by writers like Karl Heinzen to recognize the existence of classes in society. Marx wrote that no credit was due to him for discovering the existence of classes in modern society or the class struggle among them.

What I did that was new was (1) to show that the _existence of classes is_ simply bound up with _certain historical phases of the development of production_; (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the _dictatorship of the proletariat_; (3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the _abolition of all classes_ and to a _classless society._

If the reader substitutes the usual ‘rule of the proletariat’ for the striking phrase here, the content of this statement will be perfectly clear. There is nothing whatever in this passage to indicate that Marx thought he was making an unusual pronouncement. Then why did he use ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ instead of his usual term? Well, this is precisely what is explained by the fact that Weydemeyer himself had just given that term special visibility. Marx’s letter was simply echoing the title of the article by Weydemeyer, who was himself echoing the recent exchange in the _NDZ_ between Marx and Lüning. Marx was throwing in a phrase that had special associations for his correspondent. Writing a personal letter, Marx could let this be understood. When taken out of this context and held up to view as if it were an extraordinary statement, its significance is distorted.[[44]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n44)

##### 6. The Second Period of ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’

In the two decades before the Paris Commune, there was not a single case of Marx’s use of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat. [[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n45) As always, he kept referring to the ‘rule of the proletariat,’ ‘conquest of political power,’ ‘workers’ state,’ and similar expressions to denote the assumption of state power by the working class. Accidental? It is entirely explainable in terms of the thesis offered above. During these two decades, in which the left movement was at a low ebb, Marx’s work and activities did not involve him in any connection with Blanquist elements. There was no need for him to deal with their conception of dictatorship.

For the same reason the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ did not appear in _The Civil War in France,_ the defense and analysis of the Paris Commune that Marx wrote for the General Council of the International. At this time, and until the Communard refugees started trickling into London, the Blanquists had refused any ties with the International; it was not “revolutionary” enough for them.

In _The Civil War in France_ Marx argued that the Commune was a working-class government,” “the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of Labour.” The Commune was a _workers’ state_ of brief duration and naturally with all kinds of limitations and inadequacies. Marx’s characterization of the Commune was so sweeping in this regard that there can be no doubt that, for him, it was accepted as an example of the _rule_ (or “dictatorship”) of the proletariat.

At the same time _The Civil War in France_ filled pages with a description and celebration of the extraordinary advance in _democracy_ represented by the Commune government form and actions. The Commune “supplied the Republic with the basis of really democratic institutions”; its measures “could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people.”[[Den dialektiske materialismes ABC-1721248246487.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n46)

It is clear that, in Marx’s eyes, the Commune took no “dictatorial” measures – if the present-day meaning of the word is used. Indeed, there had been a proposal inside the Commune to do just that, as the military situation grew more and more precarious before the military power of the Versailles government. The Blanquist-Jacobin majority of the Commune proposed to set up a dictatorial body to be called (shades of Robespierre) a Committee of Public Safety, with special arbitrary powers. The debate over “dictatorship” (this is how it was put) was acrimonious; when the proposal was adopted, the Minority walked out of the Commune. This split would have attracted more attention from historians than it has if the final Versaillese assault on the city had not commenced at virtually the moment of the split, making it academic as all pitched in to the military defense. But in hindsight it is important to note that the antidictatorial Minority represented most of the International people as well as the Proudhonists, and in particular it included all the figures who had any special connection with Marx or showed any tendency to look to his ideas (for example, Serraillier, who was practically Marx’s personal representative; Frankel, Longuet, Varlin).[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n47)

Since the Paris Commune clearly had no “dictatorial” trappings in the modern sense, it has always represented a problem for those who maintain that Marx’s ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ meant something specially “dictatorial” as compared with a mere workers’ state. When we find that Marx (not only Engels) had no compunction about calling it a “dictatorship of the proletariat,” this fact itself speaks volumes about our basic thesis.

After the fall of the Commune, Blanquist Communards among others found their way to London, where they began working with Marx, especially on refugee aid; several were co-opted onto the General Council. No evidence is needed to understand that Marx naturally discussed his views with them, as with others; but there is good evidence nevertheless. In other words, as in the 1850s, Marx tried to “re-educate” them from his standpoint.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n48) The Blanquists just as naturally set out to turn the International into a Blanquist sect. With this two-way influence, it is of the greatest interest that now we find Marx – once again after twenty years – using the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat.’ And we will also now find the Blanquist refugees using it too! – in their case, for the first time.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n49)

_Locus 5._ The first post-Commune meeting of the International was the London Conference of September 1871. At its end there was an anniversary celebration of the International’s founding, bringing the participants together in a social occasion – a banquet plus “toasts” (short speeches). Marx was voted into the chair and forced to make a short speech.

A correspondent of the _New York World_ sent in a longish dispatch about the banquet (“The Reds in Session”) with a considerable summary of Marx’s talk. About the Commune, Marx reiterated his view that “the Commune was the conquest of the political power of the working classes.” Its aim was to remove any “base for class rule and oppression”: “But before such a change could be effected a proletarian _dictature_ would become necessary.” (The verbs are those of the reporter’s paraphrase.)

Thus Marx’s first use of the term since 1852 took place before an assemblage heavily weighted with Blanquist Communards, where “the name that set the whole assembly in motion like an electric shock was Blanqui’s” (in the words of the dispatch). Apparently Marx even used the French form of the term (_dictature_). He was once again confronting the Blanquist mind with his own conception of _class_ dictatorship.[[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n50)

_Locus 6._ Marx’s next use of the term came in an article written around the turn of the year 1872 into 1873, as a polemic against Proudhon and anarchism, not so much on anarchism itself as on the anarchist stance of principled hostility to revolutionary political activity. It was published in December 1873 in an Italian socialist annual under the title “Indifference to Politics.”

The article begins abruptly with a long section, all in quotation marks, which purports to represent what an antipolitical Proudhonist or anarchist would say if he set down his views frankly. The ‘dictatorship’ term occurs in the course of this fictitious speech; for the speaker is shown attacking the idea of the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ in the same way as he attacks any idea of political action or political power.

In this way the Proudhonist is represented as asserting: “If the political struggle of the working class assumes violent forms, if the workers substitute their revolutionary dictatorship for the dictatorship of the bourgeois class, they commit the terrible crime of violating principle, for” (continues Marx) “the workers do not lay down arms and abolish the state but rather “give it a revolutionary and transitional form.”

As usual, the ‘dictatorship’ phrase is used here as only another formulation for workers’ political power; but there is a special interest. Here Marx makes the thought plain by counterposing two class “dictatorships”; the “dictatorship of the bourgeois class” is made coordinate with the “revolutionary dictatorship” of the working class. This usage underlines that Marx thinks of class dictatorships (either one) in terms of the class nature of political power, rather than in terms of special governmental forms.[[51]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n51)

When the Hague Congress of the International (September 1872) decided to transfer the center to New York – a proposal Marx made, no doubt, in order to stave off the coming push by the Blanquists to take over the movement for their own purposes, having helped save it from Bakunin – the Blanquists reacted by announcing their split from the International and their open reconstitution of a Blanquist sect. By this time their programmatic ideas had undergone a degree of “Marxification,” though not on their basic notion of revolution by a putschist band. In pamphlets, _Internationale et Revolution_ (1872) and _Aux Communeux_ (1874), they set down their ideas. As Engels wrote to a friend, the 1872 brochure “quite seriously explains all our economic and political principles as Blanquist discoveries.” This is a jocular exaggeration, but indeed the Blanquists threw in the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ as a new formulation (new for them) for the coming Blanquist seizure of power. [The passages in the Blanquist brochures which talked about “dictatorship” are quoted and discussed in _Karl Marx’s Theory of Revolution 3;_ they would be digressive here. Suffice it to say that other passages in the brochures still made it clear that, however new their phraseology, they still advocated the assumption ofrevolutionary power by a minority band, in the traditional Blanquist sense.] This led to Engels’ first use of the term under his own name.[[52]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n52)

_Locus 7._ Hard on the heels of Marx’s Italian article, Engels used the term in Part III of his work _The Housing Question._ It occurred in two passages.

In the first Engels discussed the Blanquist pamphlet of 1872, which, he claimed, “adopted, and almost literally at that, the views of German scientific socialism on the necessity of political action by the proletariat and of its dictatorship as the transition to the abolition of classes and with them of the state – views such as had already been expressed in the _Communist Manifesto_ and since then on innumerable occasions.” This shows strikingly that Engels saw nothing in the term ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ which was not already in, say, the _Manifesto_ – which said nothing about any “dictatorship.”

The second passage is interesting for a similar reason. Here Engels was polemizing against a Proudhonist, who attacked the very notion of class political power, or “class rule.” Engels replies: why, _every_ political party wants to establish its rule in the state; a socialist workers’ party likewise strives for the rule of the working class.

Moreover, _every_ real proletarian party, from the English Chartists onward, has always put forward a class policy, the organization of the proletariat as an independent political party, as the first condition of the struggle, and the dictatorship of the proletariat as the immediate aim of the struggle.

What leaps to the eye is Engels’ assumption that ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ has no _special_ meaning other than the establishment of the “rule” of the working class. “Every” real working-class party stands for it: this statement can make no sense to anyone who believes that there is some special “theory of proletarian dictatorship” in Marx and Engels, involving special notions about “dictatorial” measures.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n53)

_Locus 8._ The clearest explanation of the meaning of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ came soon (1874) in an article by Engels devoted precisely to the Blanquists’ adoption of the term, in their brochure _Aux Communeux._ This article, “Program of the Blanquist Refugees of the Commune,” is, far and away, the best analysis of the Blanquist tendency ever published, but this is not our present subject. Its statement on _our_ subject goes as follows:

From the fact that Blanqui conceives of every revolution as the _coup de main_ of a small revolutionary minority, what follows of itself is the necessity of dictatorship after its success – the dictatorship, please note, not of the entire revolutionary class, the proletariat, but of the small number of those who made the _coup de main_ and who themselves are organized beforehand under the dictatorship of one person or a few.

One can see that Blanqui is a revolutionary of the previous generation.

There could be no more instructive differentiation between – on the one hand – Marx’s conception of the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ as the rule (‘dictatorship’) of a majority c lass or class movement, and – on the other – the traditional conception of dictatorship, the idea of the “previous generation,” as the dictatorship of the party or revolutionary band, hence entailing the dictatorship of the latter _over_ the proletariat.[[54]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n54)

_Locus 9_. The confrontation with the Blanquists, we see, produced several contexts for the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ during the first half of the 1870s. The term had cropped up, and this no doubt accounts for the fact that it was used by Marx in an important document in 1875.

As the two German socialist parties – the so-called “Eisenachers” led by Bebel and the Lassalleans – prepared to unite at a congress in Gotha, a draft program made for the occasion was filled with concessions to the Lassalleans. Marx, incensed, sent a letter to Eisenacher leaders, critically analyzing the program and attacking the Lassallean formulations and ideas. This “Critique of the Gotha Program” was neither a personal letter nor a public article, but a restricted circular of political discussion.

The passage referring to ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is one of the most often-quoted loci, but also one of the barest. It came in a section where Marx first attacked the Lassallean formula “free state.” No, wrote Marx, we do not want to make the state “free,” but rather to put it under democratic control. “Freedom consists in transforming the state from an organ set above society into one thoroughly subordinated to it, and today too the state forms are more free or less free to the extent that they restrict the ‘freedom of the state.’” This was a blow struck against “the Lassallean sect’s servile belief in the state.” Marx next objected to confusing the terms “present-day state” and “present-day society.” The latter is capitalist society, and _different_ present-day states may have capitalist society as their social basis. He then raised a question about the “future” state beyond bourgeois society:

The question comes up, then: what transformation will the state undergo in a communist society? In other words, what societal functions will remain there that are analogous to the present state functions?

His answer was lamentably brief:

Between the capitalist and the communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. To this there corresponds a political transition period whose state can be nothing but _the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat._

The one thing this short statement makes clear is that Marx did not think in terms of more or less dictatorial forms of the transitional period represented by the workers’ state. Especially in the twentieth century it was not uncommon to read that, according to Marx, a workers’ state might _or might not_ be a “dictatorship of the proletariat,” depending presumably on how severely dictatorial it had to become. This interpretation is excluded by Marx’s words: the workers’ state “can be nothing but” a dictatorship of the proletariat; in other words, the two terms are synonymous. In this connection, it is worth noting that, soon after the passage quoted, Marx warned against confusing the “state” with the “government machine.” This has to be applied to the previous statement that in the transitional period _the state will be the dictatorship of the proletariat_. For Marx this was a statement about the societal content of the state, the class character of the political power. It was not a statement about the forms of the government machine or other structural aspects of government or policies.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n55)

This was the last appearance of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ in Marx’s writings.

##### 7. The Third Period of ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’

When Marx died in 1883, the term had not come up for eight years; and another seven years passed before it appeared again under Engels’ name. During this fifteen-year hiatus, the old Blanquist problem that had originally elicited the term had completely changed. When the term re-emerged, it was as an echo from 1875, that is, it was due to the publication of Marx’s “Critique of the Gotha Program.”

In 1890 the German Social-Democratic Party was preparing to adopt a new party program, replacing the Gotha Program of 1875. (The new program was going to be adopted by the Erfurt Congress of 1891.) Engels was determined to use the pre-Congress discussion to make known to the movement what the party leadership (specifically Liebknecht, Bebel being in prison) had done its best to suppress, namely Marx’s views on Lassalle and Lassalleanism. Engels disinterred the manuscript from Marx’s papers and, with some difficulty, managed to get it published in the party press.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n56)

_Locus 10_. In October 1890, as he was pulling the critique out of the archive, he sat down to write a letter to a comrade discussing the materialist conception of history. This is one of the letters in which Engels explained that this conception does _not_ present economic factors as alone operative in history. Look at Marx’s _Eighteenth Brumaire,_ he advised, “which almost exclusively concerns itself with the _special_ role that political struggles and events play, naturally within the framework of their _general_ dependence on economic conditions.” Pointing to other analyses by Marx, he added:

Or why then do we fight for the political dictatorship of the proletariat, if political power is economically powerless? Force (i.e., state power) is also an economic power. [Letter to C. Schmidt, October 27, 1890]

Once again, we see, Engels assumed, as a matter that did not even require discussion, that ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ was a mere synonym for the conquest of political power by the working class. Once again, if the term is assigned a narrower or more special meaning, this rather casual reference by Engels ceases to make sense.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n57)

When Marx’s “Critique” was published in the _Neue Zeit,_ it was a “bombshell” (as Engels said). The main reason for this was its criticism of Lassalleanism, but the reference to the “revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat” was equally denounced by the right wing of the party. One leader of the parliamentary group repudiated it on the floor of the Reichstag. For a while the entire party leadership boycotted Engels personally for daring to make Marx’s views known to the party membership and the public. Never before had the right wing’s hostility to Marx come out in the open as it did now.[[Deres Moral og Vores-1721249695853.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n58)

_Locus 11,_ Meanwhile Engels was working on a new edition of Marx’s _The Civil War in France._ In March he finished his new introduction to that analysis of the Paris Commune. This was in effect an essay on the Commune: once more he dissected the Blanquist approach to revolution –

the viewpoint that a relatively small number of resolute, well-organized men would be able ... to maintain power until they succeeded in sweeping the mass of people into the revolution and ranging them round the small band of leaders. This involved, above all, the strictest, dictatorial centralization of all power in the hands of the new revolutionary government.

Like Marx, Engels reviewed the Commune’s implementation of real democracy. And then, at the very end, he paid his respects to the right-wingers who were attacking Marx’s “Critique”:

Of late, the Social-Democratic philistine has once more been filled with wholesome terror at the phrase: dictatorship of the proletariat. Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In calling the Commune a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ Engels was echoing Marx’s banquet speech of 1871, which until quite recently was virtually unknown to the marxological industry. Hence for a very long time it was customary for writers to assert that this was Engels’ own invention – for how could the Commune be a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ if it did not take some sturdily “dictatorial” steps? Plainly these marxologists will have to argue that Marx – like Engels – did not understand “Marxism”; only they do, having virtually invented it.[[59]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n59)

_Locus 12._ Three months later, Engels had another bombshell ready for the “Social-Democratic philistine” wing of the party: a critique of the draft Erfurt Program. He was taking the opportunity, he said, “to strike at the peaceable opportunism of the _Vorwärts_ [the party organ]” and at the reformist view that bourgeois society would of itself “grow” into socialist society. (By the way, the myth that by this time Engels had become an advocate of “peaceable” gradualism was invented, after his death, by the very people against whom this campaign was directed.)

Engels’ critique of the draft program especially raised the question of including a demand for the democratic republic as one of the “democratic” planks, and argued that a peaceful assumption of power was not possible in Germany. This emphasis was directed head-on against the trend toward reformist adaptation to the German imperial state which was developing in the party. He wrote:

If anything is established, it is that our party and the working class can come to power only under the form of the democratic republic. This is even the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the great French revolution [the Paris Commune] has already shown.

It was another chance for Engels to get in a lick for the phrase that had recently upset all the Social-Democratic philistines; in a different year he might have said, “specific form for the workers’ state.” But the important thing was that he was explaining the relationship between the _governmental form_ (democratic republic) and the class content of the state (dictatorship of the proletariat). The Paris Commune [Because of the expression “great French revolution,” the assumption has often been made that Engels meant the French Revolution of 1789; but the idea that he, or anyone else, could view 1789 (or 1793) as a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is too absurd to entertain. The specific reasons why this interpretation is untenable are presented in _Karl Marx’s Theory of Revolution_ 3.[[60]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n60)] had shown in revolutionary practice that a workers’ state (dictatorship of the proletariat) could and probably would be based on the forms of the democratic republic.[[61]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n61)

Engels’ coupling of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ with the term ‘democratic republic’ has been another target for the marxological campaign to turn ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ into a special slogan about dictatorship. Much of this campaign depends, unwittingly, on the _later_ pattern according to which the term ‘democratic’ was used as a shorthand form for ‘bourgeois-democratic,’ especially but not only in the Russian movement. But neither Marx nor Engels ever _limited_ the word ‘democratic’ to the meaning of ‘bourgeois-democratic.’ Indeed, no one has ever tried to show that they did; we are again dealing with an unthought-through assumption, based on the naive belief that one’s own political jargon had arisen with Adam.

But the main difficulty has not been inability to see that ‘democratic republic,’ to most people, meant a republic that was democratic, and not some special term that only the sophisticated initiates could understand. The main difficulty, as before, is the assumption that a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ _has_ to be “dictatorial” in the modern sense, and therefore could not be clothed in straightforward democratic forms.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n62)

Engels, who thought that a ‘democratic republic’ meant a democratic republic, had a proposal to make in his critique of the draft Erfurt Program, especially for those who argued that the demand for a democratic republic could not be openly placed in the program because the government would utilize it as a pretext to harass the party. We can get around that, he suggested: “in my opinion what should go in and can go in is the demand for the _concentration of all political power in the hands of the people’s representation._”

This is a classic formulation of the meaning of thoroughgoing democracy: “the concentration of all political power in the hands of the people’s representation.” It would stand for the illegal “democratic republic, “ which is “the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat.” Engels, the advocate of that revolutionary dictatorship which so appalled the right wing, was arguing with them that they should say something about their goal of a democratic republic _instead of adapting themselves to the legality of the kaiser’s regime._[[63]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n63)

##### 8. Engels vs. Plekhanov: Pointer to the Future

The last echo of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ that comes to us from Engels’ last years points straight ahead to the next period, in which the term parted company with Marx and Engels.

In 1893 a young Russian Social-Democratic emigré visited Engels. Plekhanov, the leader and theoretician of the relatively new Russian Marxist group, had given him a letter of recommendation. A third of a century later, A. M. Voden wrote up his memoirs, including his “Talks with Engels.” Just why ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ came into the conversation is not clear from Voden’s account. The two were discussing the relations between Narodniks (Russian Populists) and the Russian Social-Democrats, including Plekhanov’s attitude. Voden writes:

Engels asked how Plekhanov himself stood on the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. I was forced to admit that G. V Plekhanov had repeatedly expressed his conviction to me that when “we” come to power, of course “we” would allow freedom to no one but “ourselves” ... However, in response to my question who exactly should be taken to be the monopolists of freedom, Plekhanov answered: the working class headed by comrades who correctly understand Marx’s teachings and who draw the correct conclusions from those teachings. And in response to my question on what comprises the objective criteria for a correct understanding of Marx’s teachings and the correct practical conclusions flowing therefrom, G. V Plekhanov limited himself to the statement that it was all laid out “clearly enough, it seems” in his (Plekhanov’s) works.

If Voden’s report was accurate (and there is no reason to doubt it), then it is clear what the leader and teacher of Russian Social-Democracy – destined also to be the leading theoretician of Russian Menshevism – was teaching his movement. When “we” seize power, democratic rights (“freedom”) would be withdrawn from opponents, and a dictatorial regime would be imposed with the dictatorship in the hands of the victorious party or just its leadership. There is no mystery about where Plekhanov – himself a Narodnik only a few years before – had gotten these notions: this conception of dictatorship had long been the unquestioned orthodoxy of the Blanquist and Bakuninist elements who had long provided most of the training of Russian (and other) revolutionaries. He did not get it from Marx’s old term; the relationship was the other way ’round – this was the standard conception which he imposed on Marx’s term when he heard it. And what did Engels think of this, when told by Voden? We learn this in Voden’s memoirs, which continue as follows:

After inquiring whether I personally on the other hand was satisfied with such an objective criterion [that is, Plekhanov’s], Engels expressed the opinion that the application of that sort of criterion would either lead to the Russian Social-Democracy’s turning into a sect with its unavoidable and always undesirable practical consequences, or it would give rise in the Russian Social-Democracy – at least among the emigré Russian Social-Democrats – to a series of splits from which Plekhanov himself would not benefit.

In short, thought Engels, Plekhanov’s perspective would wreck the movement, either by a split or (what amounts to the same thing) sectification. There is an indication in Voden’s memoirs that there was more to report about Engels’ hostile reception to this account of the Russian leader’s views. Engels remarked that Plekhanov seemed to him a Russian analogue of H. M. Hyndman. Voden footnoted that Plekhanov took this as a compliment, and it is likely that Voden had no idea of what it meant. Hyndman, the leader of the British “Marxist” sect which Marx and Engels used to denounce in the most cutting terms, was furthermore viewed by them as a sect dictator, whose dictatorial patterns had split the movement more than once.

It is hard to exaggerate the significance of this little-known episode, as a symbol and as an educational beam of light on the meaning of the question. In just a few years the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party was going to become the first socialist organization in the world to include the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ in its program – though Marx and Engels had always refused to propose such a step. The term was written into the party program by Plekhanov, who by that time was perhaps the most prestigious theoretician of Marxism outside Germany.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article2.htm#n64)

Thus the new era of the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ was launched on its way – not by Lenin (as the usual myth has it) but by the future leader and theoretician of Menshevism.

Thus the antidemocratic interpretation of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat,’ repudiated by Engels when it was reported to him, was going to blossom in the Second International and particularly in the Russian movement.

### Marx and the Working Class

According to the legend tirelessly peddled by his critics, Marx was an incorrigible snob who despised working-class socialists, regarding them as dolts and asses who had acquired ideas above their station. The biographer Robert Payne, for example, refers to ‘Marx’s contempt for humanity and especially for that section of it which he called the proletariat’. Even a sophisticated Marxologist such as Professor Shlomo Avineri can write that ‘Marx’s sceptical view of the proletariat’s ability to conceive its own goals and realise them without outside intellectual help has often been documented. It suits his remark that revolutions never start with the “masses” but originate in élite groups.’ Where have these views and remarks been documented? You will search the works of Marx – and indeed the footnotes of Avineri – in vain. Avineri mentions the ‘snubbing’ of Wilhelm Weitling: however, Marx was in fact remarkably generous to Weitling, arguing that one shouldn’t be too beastly to a poor tailor who had genuinely suffered for his beliefs, and what caused their eventual rift was not lordly disdain for the underclass but terminal exasperation at the political and religious delusions of an insufferable egomaniac. Had Weitling been a middle-class intellectual, Marx would have treated him far more savagely.

Which brings us to Avineri’s second exhibit. ‘Even one of his most loyal followers, George Eccarius, also a tailor by trade, came in for a generous measure of unearned contempt from his master and teacher.’ Once again no sources are cited: clearly Marx’s lofty scorn for tailors, cobblers and other pond-life is so universally accepted as to need no verification.

This is the exact opposite of the truth. It was Marx who gave Eccarius his first break by publishing his study of ‘Tailoring in London’ in the short-lived London journal, _NRZ Revue_. ‘The author of this article,’ Marx informed readers, ‘is himself a _worker_ in one of London’s tailoring shops. We ask the German bourgeoisie how many authors it numbers capable of grasping the real movement in a similar manner? ... The reader will note how here, instead of the sentimental, moral and psychological criticism employed against existing conditions by Weitling and other workers who engage in authorship, a purely materialist understanding and a freer one, unspoilt by sentimental whims, confronts bourgeois society and its movement.’

No sign there of contempt, unearned or otherwise. Throughout the darkest days of the 1850s Marx remained attentive and sympathetic, helping Eccarius place articles in German-language newspapers abroad in the hope of rescuing him from the treadmill of tailoring from five in the morning until eight in the evening. ‘If any money is forthcoming, I would suggest that Eccarius get some first so that he doesn’t have to spend all day tailoring,’ he advised a journalistic comrade in Washington. ‘Do try and see that he gets _something,_ if at all possible.’ However dire his own financial straits might be, he insisted that Eccarius’s needs should take priority.

When Eccarius went down with consumption, in February 1859, Marx described it as ‘the most tragic thing I have yet experienced here in London’. A few months later he noted sadly that Eccarius ‘is again going to pieces in his sweatshop’, and asked if Engels could send the poor chap a few bottles of port to sustain him. In 1860, forced by ill health to give up tailoring for a while, Eccarius was installed in lodgings rented at Marx’s own expense and fixed up with regular work for the American press at $3 an article. When three of Eccarius’s children died during the scarlet-fever epidemic of 1862, it was the poverty-stricken Marx who organised an appeal fund to cover the funeral expenses. Finally, when invited to nominate a speaker for the historic public meeting in September 1864, he again pressed the claims of his old friend. Eccarius put on a ‘splendid performance’, Marx reported to Engels afterwards, adding that he himself had been happy to remain mute on the platform. And yet, even now, many authors continue to repeat the old nonsense about Marx’s mean-spirited and snooty disdain for mere tailors.

In fact, it was the presence of so many genuine workers – and the refreshing lack of preening middle-class dilettantes – that attracted him to the International’s inaugural rally, persuading him ‘to waive my usual standing rule to decline any such invitations’. Although he came to St Martin’s Hall only as a silent observer, by the end of the evening he had been co-opted on to the General Council.

Now there seems to be a slight paradox here. Marx himself was indisputably a bourgeois intellectual. By joining the Council was he not in danger of diluting the proletarian purity which he so admired? To answer the question we need to look more closely at the composition of the International. The General Council consisted of two Germans (Marx and Eccarius), two Italians, three Frenchmen and twenty-seven Englishmen – almost all of them working class. It was a muddled _mélange_: English trade unionists who cared passionately about the right to free collective bargaining but had no interest in socialist revolution; French Proudhonists who dreamed of utopia but disliked trade unions; plus a few republicans, disciples of Mazzini and campaigners for Polish freedom. They disagreed about almost everything – and particularly about what role, if any, the enlightened middle classes should be allowed to play in the International. In a letter to Engels two years after its foundation, Marx reported an all-too-typical contretemps:

By way of demonstration against the French monsieurs – who wanted to exclude everyone except ‘_travailleurs manuels_’, in the first instance from membership of the International Association, or at least from eligibility for election as delegate to the congress – the English yesterday proposed _me_ as President of the General Council. I declared that under _no_ circumstances could I accept such a thing, and proposed Odger [the English trade union leader] in my turn, who was then in fact re-elected, although some people voted for me despite my declaration.

The minute-book for this meeting records that Marx ‘thought himself incapacitated because he was a head worker and not a hand worker’, but it is not quite as simple as that. (His desire to get on with writing _Capital_ may have exerted a stronger tug at the sleeve.) A few years later, when a doctor called Sexton was proposed for membership, there were the usual mutterings about ‘whether it was desirable to add professional men to the Council’; according to the minutes, however, ‘Citizen Marx did not think there was anything to fear from the admission of professional men while the great majority of the Council was composed of workers.’ In 1872, when there were problems with various crackpot American sects infiltrating the International, it was Marx himself who proposed – successfully – that no new section should be allowed to affiliate unless at least two-thirds of its members were wage labourers.

In short, while accepting that most office-holders and members must be working class, Marx was unembarrassed by his own lack of proletarian credentials: men such as himself still had much to offer the association as long as they didn’t pull rank or hog the limelight. Engels followed this example, though as an affluent capitalist he was understandably more reluctant to impose himself. After selling his stake in the family firm and moving down to London in 1870, he accepted a seat on the General Council almost at once but declined the office of treasurer. ‘Citizen Engels objected that none but working men ought to be appointed to have anything to do [with] the finances,’ the minutes record. ‘Citizen Marx did not consider the objection tenable: an ex-commercial man was the best for the office.’ Engels persisted with his refusal – and was probably right to do so. As the Marxian scholar Hal Draper has pointed out, handling money was the touchiest job in a workers’ association, for charges of financial irregularity were routine ploys whenever political conflict started; and a Johnny-come-lately businessman from Manchester would have been an obvious target for any ‘French monsieurs’ who wanted to stir up trouble.

Marx may have preferred to work behind the scenes, but he worked exceptionally hard all the same: without his efforts the International would probably have disintegrated within a year. The Council met every Tuesday at its shabby HQ in Greek Street, Soho – on the site which, almost exactly a century later, was to become the Establishment night-club, where satirists such as Lenny Bruce and Peter Cook used rather different techniques to undermine prevailing orthodoxy. The minute-books show that he was happy to take on his share of the donkey-work. (‘Citizens Fox, Marx and Cremer were deputed to attend the Compositors’ Society ... Citizen Marx proposed, Citizen Cremer seconded, that the Central Council thank Citizen Cottam for his generous gift ... Citizen Marx stated that societies in Basle and Zurich had joined the Association ... Citizen Marx reported that he had received £3 from Germany for members’ cards, which he paid to the Financial Secretary...’) His influence was apparent from the outset. The initial item of business at the Council’s very first meeting, on 5 October 1864, was a proposal by Marx that William Randal Cremer of the London Trades Council should be appointed secretary. (‘Mr Cremer was unanimously elected.’) Later that evening Marx was elected to a subcommittee whose task was to draw up rules and principles of the new Association.

So far so good. But then Marx fell ill, thus missing the next two meetings. He was roused from his sick-bed on 18 October by an urgent letter from Eccarius, who warned that if he didn’t come to the General Council that evening a hopelessly insipid and confused statement of aims would be adopted in his absence. Marx staggered down to Greek Street and listened aghast as the worthy Le Lubez read out ‘a fearfully cliché-ridden, badly written and totally unpolished preamble pretending to be a declaration of principles, with Mazzini showing through the whole thing from beneath a crust of the most insubstantial scraps of French socialism’. After long debate, Eccarius proposed that this unappetising menu be sent back to the subcommittee for further editing, cunningly forestalling any suspicion of a coup by promising that its ‘sentiments’ would remain unchanged.

This was the opportunity Marx needed. Putting on his most innocent expression, he suggested that the subcommittee meet two days later at his house, which offered rather more comfort (and a better stocked cellar) than the poky little room in Greek Street. When the team assembled _chez_ Marx, he then spun out a discussion about the rules at such interminable length that by one in the morning they had still not even begun their ‘editing’ of the preamble. How were they to have it ready in time for the next gathering of the General Council five days later? His weary colleagues, yawning fit to bust, gratefully accepted Marx’s suggestion that he should try to cobble something together himself. All the draft papers were left in his hands, and they departed to their beds.

‘I could see that it was impossible to make anything out of the stuff,’ he told Engels. ‘In order to justify the extremely peculiar way in which I intended to edit the sentiments that had already been “carried,” I wrote _An Address to the Working Classes_ (which was not in the original plan: a sort of review of the adventures of the working class since 1845); on the pretext that all the necessary facts were contained in this “Address” and that we ought not to repeat the same things three times over, I altered the whole preamble, threw out the _déclaration des principes_ and finally replaced the forty rules by ten.’ As a sop to the more pious and less revolutionary members, he threw in a few references to truth, morality, duty and justice, and avoided the belligerent rhetorical flourishes that had so enlivened the _Communist Manifesto._ As he explained to Engels, ‘It will take time before the revival of the movement allows the old boldness of language to be used. We must be _fortiter in re, suaviter in modo._’ Which, being translated from the Latin, essentially means: speak softly and carry a big stick.

Despite the years of seclusion, Marx had lost none of his old procedural guile. At its meeting of 1 November, partly at his suggestion, the General Council co-opted several new members. They included Karl Pfänder, the Communist League veteran who had once examined Wilhelm Liebknecht’s skull; Hermann Jung, a Swiss watchmaker; Eugène Dupont, a French musical-instrument maker; and Friedrich Lessner, the tailor who had rushed the manuscript of the _Communist Manifesto_ to the printers in 1848. All were stalwart supporters of Marx – and he needed all the support he could get, since some of the English members were none too happy with his new text. One of the milder suggestions, as the minutes record, was that ‘some explanation should be given (in the form of a footnote) of the terms “nitrogen” and “carbon"’. (Marx thought this quite unnecessary. ‘We need hardly remind the reader,’ he commented wearily in the footnote, ‘that, apart from the elements of water and certain inorganic substances, carbon and nitrogen form the raw materials of human food.’) A more hostile complaint came from a printer, William Worley, who had made his opinions clear at the previous meeting by objecting to the statement that ‘the capitalist was opposed to the labourer’. This time, his reformist conscience was outraged by Marx’s description of capitalists as ‘profitmongers’. By eleven votes to ten, the council agreed that the inflammatory word be erased. The address was then passed _nem. con_.

The unanimous acceptance of this ‘review of the adventures of the working class’ is a tribute to Marx’s skill in judging how far he could go. There were no revolutionary predictions, no spectres or hobgoblins stalking Europe – though he did his best to make the reader’s flesh creep with a description of British industry as a vampire which could survive only by sucking the blood of children. Mostly, he allowed the facts to speak for themselves, larding the document with official statistics plagiarised from his own work in progress, _Capital_, to justify his claim that ‘the misery of the working masses has not diminished from 1848 to 1864’. But, as ever, his attempt to imagine an alternative was as formless if sweet as a bowl of blancmange: ‘Like slave labour, like serf labour, hired labour is but a transitory and inferior form, destined to disappear before associated labour plying its toil with a willing hand, a ready mind and a joyous heart.’

The address ended with the words ‘Proletarians of all countries, Unite!’; the equally familiar phrase encouraging them to throw off their chains was tactfully omitted. Even so, one can’t help wondering how closely his colleagues scrutinised the text before approving it. ‘The lords of land and the lords of capital will always use their political privileges for the defence and perpetuation of their economical monopolies,’ he announced in the final pages. ‘To conquer political power has therefore become the great duty of the working classes.’ Such a notion was anathema to many of the English representatives on the General Council, who thought that the great duty of the working classes was to form trade unions which could bargain for better pay and conditions, while leaving politics to Members of Parliament. This was certainly the view of the impeccably moderate general secretary, William Randal Cremer, who later became a Liberal MP and ended his career as a knight of the realm. The fact that even he voted for the address tells us much about Marx’s powers of persuasion. As old Communist Leaguers such as Pfänder and Lessner knew, Marx’s intimidating presence – his dark eyes, his slashing wit, his formidable analytical brain – would always dominate any committee. Scarcely a month after sitting silently on the stage at St Martin’s Hall, he was already taking charge.

But mere force of personality was not enough to quell the feuds and animosities that inevitably characterised such an incongruous hybrid as the International. Even the small French contingent on the General Council was itself split into two irreconcilable factions of republicans and Proudhonists. The republicans, represented by Le Lubez, were essentially middle-class radicals – red hot for _Liberté, égalité_ and _fraternité_ but rather less excited by arguments about industry or property. Proudhon’s earnest disciples, led by the engraver Henri Louis Tolain, regarded republics and governments as centralised tyrannies that were inimical to the interests of the small shopkeepers and artisans whose cause they championed; all they wanted was a network of mutual-credit societies and small-scale co-operatives. Another Proudhonist, who joined the General Council in 1866, was the young medical student Paul Lafargue, later to become the husband of Laura Marx. His first encounters with his future father-in-law were unpromising. ‘That damned boy Lafargue pesters me with his Proudhonism,’ Karl complained to Laura, ‘and will not rest, it seems, until I have administered to him a sound cudgelling.’ After one of Lafargue’s many speeches declaring nations and nationalities to be the purest moonshine, Marx raised a laugh among his English colleagues by pointing out that ‘our friend Lafargue, and others who had abolished nationalities, had addressed us in “French,” i.e. in a language which nine-tenths of the audience did not understand’. He added mischievously that by denying the existence of nationalities the young zealot ‘seemed quite unconsciously to imply their absorption by the model French nation’.

If the doughty English trade unionists were incredulously amused by these Gallic squabbles, they were downright astonished to learn that the great Mazzini – a heroic figure in London – was regarded by the Germans and French as a posturing ninny whose passion for national liberation had quite eclipsed any awareness of the central importance of class. ‘The position is difficult now,’ Marx admitted after another bruising session at Greek Street, ‘because one must oppose the silly Italianism of the English, on the one hand, and the mistaken polemic of the French, on the other.’

It was a time-consuming business. In a letter to Engels of March 1865 he described a fairly typical week’s work. Tuesday evening was given over to the General Council, at which Tolain and Le Lubez bickered until midnight, after which he had to adjourn to a nearby pub and sign 200 membership cards. The next day he attended a meeting at St Martin’s Hall to mark the anniversary of the Polish insurrection. On Saturday and Monday there were subcommittee meetings devoted to ‘the French question’, both of which raged on until one in the morning. And so to Tuesday, when another stormy session of the General Council ‘left the English in particular with the impression that the Frenchmen stand really in need of a Bonaparte!’ In between all these meetings, there were ‘people dashing this way and that to see me’ in connection with a conference on household suffrage which was to be held the following weekend. ‘What a waste of time!’ he groaned.

Engels thought so too. After Marx’s death he said that ‘Moor’s life without the International would be a diamond ring with the diamond broken out’, but at first he simply couldn’t understand why his friend wished to spend hours suffering in dingy Soho back rooms when he could be at his desk in Hampstead writing _Capital_. ‘I have always half-expected that the _naïve fraternité_ in the International Association would not last long,’ he commented smugly in 1865, after another bout of internecine squabbling among the French. ‘It will pass through a lot more such phases and will take up a great deal of your time.’ Until he retired to London in 1870 Engels played no part in the association.

By 1865 Marx was the _de facto_ leader of the International, though his official title was ‘corresponding secretary for Germany’. Even this was a misnomer: the death of Lassalle left him with only a couple of friends in the whole of Germany – Wilhelm Liebknecht and the gynaecologist Ludwig Kugelmann – and most of his ‘corresponding’ took the form of sniggers about the alleged homosexuality of Lassalle’s successor, Johann Baptist von Schweitzer, plus a few dismissive remarks about the appalling political backwardness of the Teutonic race. ‘There is _nothing_ I can do in Prussia at the moment,’ he wrote to Dr Kugelmann. ‘I prefer my agitation here through the “International Association” a hundred times. The effect on the English proletariat is direct and of the greatest importance. We are now stirring the General Suffrage Question here, which is, naturally, of quite different significance here than in Prussia.’

Extending the franchise was the dominant parliamentary issue of the moment – though it should be added that the various proposals for reform put forward by Tories and Whigs in the mid-1860s owed less to high principle than to the jostle for party advantage. There were debates galore, which today seem as remote and incomprehensible as the Schleswig-Holstein question, about the voting rights of ‘copyholders’, ‘£6 ratepayers’ and ‘£50 tenants-at-will’. But amid all the arcane arguments over fancy franchises and plural voting, one point was accepted by all peers and MPs: there must be some sort of property qualification to prevent the great unwashed from having any say in the nation’s affairs. ‘What I fear,’ Walter Bagehot wrote in his _English Constitution_, ‘is that both our political parties will bid for the support of the working man; that both of them will promise to do as he likes...’ Even the National Reform Union, a supposedly radical pressure group, desired only the enfranchisement of householders and rate-paying lodgers.

In the spring of 1865, after a packed meeting at St Martin’s Hall, a Reform League was founded to campaign for universal manhood suffrage. (The possibility that women might be either willing or able to vote was, apparently, too far-fetched to merit consideration.) Marx and his colleagues from the International took charge: ‘The whole leadership is in our hands,’ he revealed triumphantly to Engels. For the next year or so he threw himself into the crusade with gusto while also attending to the International, the manuscript of _Capital_, the demands of his family and creditors – and, of course, those blossoming boils on his bum, which were more prolific than ever. He hacked away at them with a cut-throat razor, watching with vicious satisfaction as the bad blood spurted over the carpet. Sometimes, having staggered to bed at 4 a.m. several nights running, he felt ‘infernally harassed’ and wished he had never emerged from hibernation.

Was the game worth so many late-night candles? He convinced himself that it was. ‘If we succeed in re-electrifying the political movement of the English working class,’ he wrote after launching the Reform League, ‘our Association will already have done more for the European working class, without making any fuss, than was possible in any other way. And there is every prospect of success.’ Not so. Reformist trade union leaders such as Cremer and Odger soon made concessions, deciding that they would be quite content with household suffrage rather than one man one vote. And that, more or less, is what they got. In the summer of 1867, Parliament approved Disraeli’s Reform Bill, which lowered the property qualification for county voters and extended the franchise to all urban householders – thus doubling the size of the electorate. But the vast majority of the working population remained as voteless as ever.

The International, too, never quite lived up to Marx’s hyperbole. There were some early successes, notably in sabotaging attempts by English employers to recruit foreign workers as strikebreakers, and the ensuing notoriety persuaded several small craft societies to affiliate – among them such exotic bodies as the Amalgamated Cordwainers of Darlington, the Hand-in-Hand Society of Coopers, the West-End Cabinet Makers, the Day-Working Bookbinders, the English journeymen Hairdressers, the Elastic Web Weavers’ Society and the Cigar Makers. But the big industrial unions stayed aloof. William Allen, general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, refused even to meet a deputation from the International. More galling still was the failure to enrol the London Trades Council, even though its secretary, George Odger, was also president of the International. By the time of the Association’s first pan-European Congress, held in Geneva during the summer of 1866, the total number of members in affiliated societies was 25,173 – by no means negligible, but hardly proof that the English proletariat had been ‘re-electrified’. If the International was to expand any further it would have to live up to its name and broaden its horizons far beyond the Cordwainers of Darlington.

Marx himself missed the Geneva Congress, yet still managed to dominate the proceedings. When the French Proudhonists issued their well-rehearsed protest against middle-class socialists (‘all men who have the duty of representing working-class groups should be workers’), William Randal Cremer defended the record of the few non-manual workers on the General Council. ‘Among those members I will mention one only, Citizen Marx, who has devoted his life to the triumph of the working classes.’ The baton was then taken up by James Carter of the Journeymen Hairdressers:

Citizen Marx has just been mentioned; he has perfectly understood the importance of this first congress, where there should be only working-class delegates; therefore he refused the delegateship he was offered in the General Council. But this is not the reason to prevent him or anyone else from coming into our midst; on the contrary, men who devote themselves completely to the proletarian cause are too rare for us to push them aside. The middle class only triumphed when, rich and powerful as it was in numbers, it allied itself with men of science ...

After this barber-shop testimonial even the leader of the Proudhon faction, Henri Tolain, felt obliged to congratulate the absent hero. ‘As a worker, I thank Citizen Marx for not accepting the delegateship offered him. In doing that, Citizen Marx showed that workers’ congresses should be made up only of manual workers.’ Citizen Marx had not intended to show anything of the kind, and there is no evidence that he stayed away from Geneva to avoid offending proletarian sensibilities. A more likely explanation is that he didn’t wish to endure tedious harangues from the French exclusionists when he could have a few days’ uninterrupted work on _Capital_.

A year earlier he had told Engels that the draft required only a few ‘finishing touches’, which would be done by September 1865. ‘I am working like a horse at the moment.’ His friends had heard many such hopeful forecasts over the years, but this time he really did seem to be in the final furlongs – even if the spavined old nag was proceeding at a limping trot rather than full gallop. Through the summer of 1865 he was vomiting every day (‘in consequence of the hot weather and related biliousness’), and a sudden influx of house guests provided further unwelcome distraction. Jenny’s buffoonish brother, Edgar von Westphalen, came to stay for six months, drinking the wine cellar dry and ‘pondering the needs of his stomach from morn till night’; other visitors included Marx’s brother-in-law from South Africa, a niece from Maastricht and the Freiligrath family. This was the price he paid for moving to a house with spare rooms, but it was a price he could ill afford. ‘For two months I have been living solely on the pawnshop,’ he fretted. ‘A queue of creditors has been hammering on my door, becoming more and more unendurable every day.’ And yet, at the still point in the centre of this whirlwind, his masterpiece was nearing completion. By the end of 1865 _Capital_ was a manuscript of 1,200 pages, a baroque mess of ink-blots and crossings-out and squiggles. On New Year’s Day 1866 he sat down to make a fair copy and polish the style – ‘licking the infant clean after long birth pangs’. But then the carbuncles returned. On doctor’s orders he was banished to Margate for a month, where he did little except bathe in the sea, swallow arsenic three times a day and feel thoroughly sorry for himself ‘I can sing with the Miller of the Dee: “I care for nobody and nobody cares for me.”’ At the end of his sea cure the carbuncles had gone – only to be replaced by rheumatism and toothache. Then the old liver trouble returned for an encore. Even on days when he was fit to work some new misfortune usually descended, as when his stationer refused to supply any more paper until the last batch had been paid for.

With exquisitely bad timing, Paul Lafargue chose this unpropitious moment to ask for the hand of the twenty-year-old Laura Marx in marriage. The Creole medical student, having met Marx through the International, had transferred his attention to the old man’s green-eyed daughter and begun wooing her with an enthusiasm which Karl thought most indecorous. Lafargue was suspect anyway, not only for Proudhonist tendencies but also because of his exotic Franco-Spanish-Indian-African ancestry, which to his prospective father-in-law suggested a certain genetic flightiness. As soon as writing paper could be found Marx sent the overzealous suitor a letter of which any Victorian paterfamilias would have been proud.

My dear Lafargue,

Allow me to make the following observations:

1. If you wish to continue your relations with my daughter, you will have to give up your present manner of ‘courting’. You know full well that no engagement has been entered into, that as yet everything is undecided. And even if she were formally betrothed to you, you should not forget that this is a matter of long duration. The practice of excessive intimacy is especially inappropriate since the two lovers will be living at the same place for a necessarily prolonged period of severe testing and purgatory ... To my mind, true love expresses itself in reticence, modesty and even the shyness of the lover towards his object of veneration, and certainly not in giving free rein to one’s passion and in premature demonstrations of familiarity. If you should urge your Creole temperament in your defence, it is my duty to interpose my sound reason between your temperament and my daughter. If in her presence you are incapable of loving her in a manner in keeping with the London latitude, you will have to resign yourself to loving her from a distance.

In fact it was Marx and not Lafargue who attributed this ardour – and almost everything else – to the ‘Creole temperament’. As late as November 1882 he was still going on about it, telling Engels that ‘Lafargue has the blemish customarily found in the negro tribe – _no sense of shame,_ by which I mean shame about making a fool of oneself.’

Before consenting to the marriage, Marx required a full account of the young man’s prospects. ‘You know that I have sacrificed my whole fortune to the revolutionary struggle,’ he wrote to Lafargue. ‘I do not regret it. Quite the contrary. If I had to live my life over again, I would do the same. I would not marry, however. As far as it lies within my power, I wish to save my daughter from the reefs on which her mother’s life was wrecked ... You must have achieved something in life before thinking of marriage, and a long period of testing is required of you and Laura.’ Not that long, as it turned out: Laura Marx’s engagement to Paul Lafargue was announced in September 1866, only a month after Marx dispatched his letter, and they were married in St Pancras register office on 2 April 1868. Her father, rather unromantically, described the union as ‘a great relief for the entire household, since Lafargue is as good as living with us, which perceptibly increases expenses’. At the wedding lunch Engels cracked so many jokes about the bride that she burst into tears.

Lacking the vivacity of Jennychen and Eleanor, Laura never enjoyed being the centre of attention. (‘As I am in the habit of keeping in the background, I am very apt to be overlooked and forgotten.’) Of all the Marx girls she was probably the most like Jenny Marx: while her sisters dreamed of careers on the stage, Laura’s only ambition was to be a good wife. Her first child, Charles Etienne (nicknamed ‘Schnapps’), was born on 1 January 1869, almost exactly nine months after the wedding, followed over the next two years by a daughter and another son. All died in infancy. There was, it seemed, no escaping those reefs on which her mother’s life had been wrecked. ‘In all these struggles we women have the harder part to bear,’ Jenny Marx wrote, mourning the loss of her grandchildren, ‘because it is the lesser one. A man draws strength from his struggle with the world outside, and is invigorated by the sight of the enemy, be their number legion. We remain sitting at home, darning socks.’

### * * *

Frederick Demuth (1851-1929) has recently become an important character in the (after)lives of Karl Marx (1818-83) and Friedrich Engels (1820-95); he was certainly no such thing at the time. Freddy, nearly 40 when his mother Helene Demuth (1820-90) died, was the sole beneficiary of her will. She left everything (£95) to her ‘son Frederick Lewis Demuth’, born Henry Frederick, according to his birth certificate, which gave no father.

Helene, known in Marx family circles as ‘Lenchen’ or (in various spellings) ‘Nim’ or ‘Nimmy’, was the daughter of a Rhineland village baker, and at an early age she had become the young Jenny von Westphalen’s maid at home. As such she had joined the Marx family in their Brussels days in the mid-1840s in order to help look after the infants. From all accounts she was good-humoured and literate, and in later years she helped the married daughters Jenny (1844-83) and Laura (1845-1911) with their babies. By 1883, the Longuet children – Jenny’s – were settled with their widower father Charles in France, and the three children of Laura and Paul Lafargue had all died in childhood by the early 1870s. After Marx’s death, Lenchen needed a ‘situation’ and Engels needed (yet another) housekeeper, so she settled there with him in the Regent’s Park Road N.W. until she died at 70 in 1890. Engels spoke at her funeral, and she was buried with the Marx family at Highgate (KM 183; 1 K 278-97; 2 K 429-40; 37 MEW 498).

Freddy was evidently well known to the Marx girls as Lenchen’s son. Jenny wrote to Laura in 1882 about a debt to Freddy and her inability to help ‘Nim’ make a journey to Germany. Shortly after Freddy’s mother died, Eleanor (1855-98) wrote to Laura, mentioning past wrongs and a sense of guilt: ‘Freddy has behaved admirably in all respects and Engels’s irritation against him is as unfair as it is comprehensible. We should none of us like to meet our pasts, I guess, in flesh and blood. I know I always meet Freddy with a sense of guilt and wrong done. The life of that man! To hear him tell of it all is a misery and shame to me.’

In the next few years Eleanor, Laura and their brother-in-law Charles Longuet helped Freddy out financially, and in 1892 Eleanor wrote to Laura: ‘It may be that I am very “sentimental” – but I can’t help feeling that Freddy has had great injustice all through his life. Is it not wonderful when you come to look things squarely in the face, how rarely we seem to practise all the fine things we preach – to others?’

Engels did not mention Freddy in his will of 29 July 1893, in which there were numerous bequests, nor in his codicil of 26 July 1895 (when he knew he was dying). Eleanor and Laura were asked by Engels in a letter to hold one-third (some £3000) of their combined share in trust for Jenny Longuet’s French children, who could not be named for legal reasons. The two women, in conjunction with their brother-in-law Charles, managed to channel some of the funds from Engels’s estate to Freddy.

In late 1897 and early 1898 – just before she apparently committed suicide on 31 March – Eleanor was in a terrible state about money, her relationship with the philandering socialist Edward Aveling (1851-98) and his deteriorating health. She wrote a series of moving letters, confiding in Freddy as Lenchen’s son: ‘I don’t think you and I have been very wicked people – and yet, dear Freddy, it does seems as if we get all the punishment.’ ‘I say to you what I would not say to anyone now’, she continued, ‘I would have told my dear old Nymmy, but as I have not, I have only you’ (2 K 680-8; 2 H 727-30; DKM 224, 240, 285; 39 MEW 318-19).

It is not apparent from the reliable evidence that survives exactly what injustices Eleanor thought Freddy had suffered and at whose hands. None of the Marx girls seemed at all occupied with paternity in their dealings with Freddy, and all three accepted him as Lenchen’s son. How long they had known of his existence, and his maternity (as it were) are not known. Possibly they were troubled about him and inclined to thoughts of guilt because he had grown up apart from his mother, so far as is known, and had enjoyed few educational advantages. Any feelings that his mother had been disadvantaged did not occur to them or did not surface in the correspondence that survives. Children were commonly put out to nurse in the 1850s, even amongst poor families like the Marxes, whose little Franziska (28 March 1851-14 April 1852) had been boarded out at about the same time as the infant Freddy. Frau Marx related this in her memoirs written in 1865: ‘We gave the poor little thing to a nurse, for we could not rear her with the [three] others in three small rooms.’ Lenchen, then about six months pregnant, was obviously in much the same position, except that housemaids who became pregnant were lucky to be kept on. Then in her memoirs Frau Marx also refers to an event in the early summer of 1851 – Freddy was born on 23 June – that caused them much distress: ‘It greatly contributed to increase our worries, both personal and others’. But she said that she did not ‘wish to relate [it] here in detail’ and gave no specifics. Marx’s letters of the following August speak of infamies and tales visited on his wife, and he mentions names, but not substance:

My wife will go under if things continue like this much longer. The constant worries, the slightest everyday struggle wears her out; and on top of that, there are the infamies of my opponents ... who seek to avenge their impotence by casting suspicions on my civil character and by disseminating the most unspeakable infamies about me. Willich, Schapper, Ruge and countless other democratic rabble make this their business.

The context here is probably the break-up of the émigré German communists into rival groups who quarrelled bitterly about money as well as politics.

More pertinently Marx had written to Engels on 31 March 1851 about a ‘mystery’ – ‘in which you also figure’ – that had given matters a ‘tragi-comic turn’. But in writing that letter he was interrupted, and in the following letter of 2 April he put off relating the matter until his visit to Manchester at the end of the month. From mid-1850 the Prussian ambassador in London, and the Prussian government itself, had been conducting a campaign to discredit Marx and Engels and other communists, and in March 1851 Ferdinand von Westphalen (1799-1876), stepbrother of Frau Marx and a civil servant in the Ministry of the Interior, was involved in moves to secure the deportation of the chief revolutionaries from Britain. Prussian methods included the use of agents to find compromising material and collect rumours and allegations that might influence the British government to comply with the plan to push the communists further afield, and Marx and Engels were circumspect in their correspondence. But it may also be that the housemaid’s pregnancy was under discussion. Engels, who was supporting the Marxes on his slender resources, was in a position to pay to have the infant fostered, but there is no record of any arrangements to which he may or may not have agreed.

If any of the odd comments in letters and memoirs were really about the pregnant Lenchen, then the affair seems to have been viewed as an inconvenient embarrassment by Marx and as the source of personal distress by his wife, but there is no sense that Marx was intimately implicated, nor that Frau Marx saw him any differently, nor that Engels himself was going to be seriously put out, because the comments that do survive indicate that everyone involved was on much the same terms as usual. The pregnant housemaid and the problem of her offspring were real – but peripheral to the domestic difficulties with money and political difficulties with spies and communists that the Marxes and Engels had to endure (R 23-4; KM 271-3; 38 CW 324-5, 402-3, 626-7).

Freddy would be an altogether minor character in any consideration of Engels’s life or Marx’s, were it not for a document, first published in extracts in 1962. According to the story recounted there, Freddy is suddenly a relation of Marx and his family and – in an ambiguous way – of Engels himself. Ostensibly the tale concerns Marx and his alleged affair with the housemaid, but it is Engels who plays the central role in the supposed narrative.

This typewritten document appears to be a letter dated 2-4 September 1898, written by Louise Freyberger _née_ Strasser (1860-1950), three years after the Engels household broke up. As Louise Kautsky, the recently divorced wife of the prominent German socialist Karl Kautsky (1854-1938), she had been asked by Engels, within a month of Lenchen’s death, to keep house for him, and she arrived post haste from Vienna. In 1894 she married Dr. Ludwig Freyberger, another émigré, and he came to live in Engels’s house, too – much to Eleanor’s displeasure, as she disliked Louise and her influence over Engels, then in his seventies (2 K 444; 2 H 725-6).

The document spins a lurid tale of deathbed revelations by Engels to Eleanor Marx, principally the claim that Marx himself was Freddy’s father. Fearing gossip imputing paternity, Engels is said to have declared ‘the truth’, in case he should be accused, after his death, of treating Freddy shabbily. The date on the document is some six months after Eleanor’s suicide, so if there was a letter, Eleanor was conveniently out of the way, though others mentioned as in on the story to some degree – such as Sam Moore (_c_. 1830-1911), Marx’s English translator, and Eleanor’s sister Laura – clearly were not. The addressee of the supposed letter, the prominent German socialist and trade unionist August Bebel (1840-1913), or anyone else who had been the recipient of such tales from Louise, could have checked with them.

Louise’s ‘letter’ has put Marx and his works in a bad light, and made Engels’s deathbed into high Victorian melodrama. After such a gothic story it is extraordinarily difficult to see the situation any other way, but this now well-known version of events must nonetheless be tested stringently against the facts as we have them. In particular Engels’s actions – attested and alleged – must be carefully scrutinized.

At the time of Freddy’s conception in 1850 and birth in 1851 the four principals in the affair, so far as we know, were Lenchen, Marx, Frau Marx and Engels. The birth of an illegitimate child to the maid was obviously difficult and trying for the household, because the situation precluded any truly humane solution. Frau Marx would not have wanted to lose her long-time maid, and Lenchen no doubt wished to keep her livelihood. Continued residence for Lenchen with the Marxes, together with her illegitimate baby, would have associated the household with ‘free love’ and moral irresponsibility, whoever the father was in fact or by repute. This was especially problematic with respect to the legitimate children, who would have been confronted – according to the standards of the time – with an example of flagrantly immoral behaviour, and one specially relevant to young girls. These were standards held by both conventional conservatives and responsible communists, albeit for somewhat different reasons. In any event such an establishment would have been poor publicity for communism, and a considerable burden for the children to bear, both legitimate and illegitimate. Lenchen could have been set up outside the family with her baby, but this was probably – with or without genuine regrets – beyond Engels’s means, and certainly against his wish to spare his own family the possibility of serious embarrassment, as his connection with ‘immorality’ might well leak out, whether or not he was presumed to be the father. The Engels family were, in any case, his employers. The obvious solution was to board the child out and leave him there, and that is in fact what happened, so far as we know.

Lenchen may not have objected very much, as it was clearly for her own good to keep her situation, for the Marx family to continue unencumbered and for the communist cause to suffer no invidious criticism. The fact that she continued in the household with evident aplomb accords with this hypothesis, and with Eleanor’s evident blankness on any injustice done to Freddy’s mother, whose infant had gone to another home. The grievous injustice, from Eleanor’s point of view, could have been the fact that Freddy had to grow up as a foster-child – no doubt a hard upbringing – away from his mother and the civilized influence of a cultured household.

Throughout their lives all four principals lived very happily together, and Lenchen ultimately served in both the Marx and the Engels households without any suggestion of reluctance. Hers is another unheard voice, as she left no written testimony other than her will, but memoirs of the two households attest to her willing service. If there were difficulties amongst the four principals of the 1850s – about finances, maternity, paternity or whatever – they were swiftly settled and never revisited. Frau Marx would hardly have made her remarks in her correspondence about disturbing events if she knew that Karl were the father, as she was most particular about the obligations of family life and could not have wished to spread such a tale any further. Presumably she made her comments because they were about a situation – one that was outside her immediate relationship with her husband – that affected her deeply.

If Engels were the father, or had taken the rap for Karl, this story would surely have surfaced at some point in the émigré community, since spiteful gossips abounded. Indeed Engels was quite capable of dishing up that sort of thing himself. Writing to Marx in 1846 about their communist contacts near Paris, Engels indulged himself in ribaldry: ‘The best of it is that in the house ... there are 2 women, 2 men, several children, one of them dubious, and despite all this not a thing happens there. They don’t even practise pederasty’ (38 CW 55).

A considerable number of highly communicative people – not all of them life-long friends of Marx or Engels by any means – knew of Freddy’s existence, and it seems to have been no particular secret that Freddy’s mother was a close associate of both Marx and Engels. Had there ever been a serious possibility that Freddy’s paternity would pose problems for either of the two – and hence for the ‘Marx party’ within the communist movement – the principals could easily have passed him off as a Demuth nephew or other relation.

Indeed the adult Freddy was known and loved in the family as Lenchen’s son, who had suffered a great injustice and needed to be helped. Eleanor spoke of him in those terms before Engels’s death and afterwards, and for that reason she is unlikely to have been the recipient of revelations on the subject of Freddy and unlikely to have sorted the Engels papers to remove any proof of Marx’s paternity. If she had learned in 1895 of something scandalous she could hardly have gone on with Freddy exactly as before, and made almost exactly the same kind of comments about injustice. The correspondence that survives concerning Freddy reflects a steady, continuing interest in him on the part of the Marx girls – and vice versa – from sometime before 1882 up to his final correspondence with Laura, shortly before her suicide in 1911. Insofar as Lenchen was a second mother to her, Freddy was a kind of half-brother, and because Lenchen was in effect a member of the Marx family, Eleanor’s efforts to put him on a par with the other Marx legatees of Engels’s will are understandable in those terms alone. Also the Engels estate was probably her only source of spare cash. Eleanor commented quite correctly in 1892 that Freddy was part of Engels’s past, but did not mention the other three principals of the original affair, because by the time of her letter they were all dead. Later when she mentioned again the injustices done to Freddy, she did not mention Engels, because by that time he was dead, too.

Engels’s reported irritation with Freddy suggests that he did not want an old embarrassment exhumed, as there was no way that Freddy’s circumstances could reflect well on himself and the Marxes as communists, and there were numerous ways that it could be construed to bring discredit on the movement. With Freddy on the scene in London questions might arise about his treatment in early life or just possibly his paternity, and the difficult matter for Engels of proving himself or others innocent of all callous behaviour might arise if such an ill-natured and unedifying inquiry were opened.

Engels had already put himself up for criticism in respect of the Burns sisters, Mary (_c_. 1823-63) and Lydia (‘Lizzie’) (1827-78) and so he was party already to conventional discretion as a first line of defence. His liaisons were never widely advertised, they were never made to look like ‘free love’, and they never involved children – though exactly why not, we do not know. Thus they appeared – to those who were determined to inquire – to be responsible domestic relationships that had merely foregone the formalities of marriage. As he was evidently ‘doing right’ by the Irish girls, not too much could be made of his living arrangements by conservatives bent on gutter politics or communists with scores to settle against Marx. The situation with respect to Freddy might well have been more difficult to explain and less easy to justify.

The most curious thing about Louise’s ‘letter’ is that it contains allegations about Marx and Engels that are quite sensational, but until the 1960s quite unknown. The ‘letter’ was addressed to one of the most prominent socialist leaders in Germany. In any case, why did Louise never raise the matter again? She was nothing if not energetic and determined, and as the intention of the ‘letter’ was plainly to impose a revelation on the world, it seems inconceivable that she put pen to paper once, and then let the sensational story drop for no less than the _fifty-two years_ that elapsed before her death in 1950.

Moreover Louise’s account of the deathbed revelation is as suspect as some of the other ‘facts’ in the document (such as the Marxes stopped sleeping together in the early 1850s – Eleanor was born in 1855 and there was a further still birth – and Louise’s very odd claim that Eleanor knew all this!). And even if the tale of Engels’s death-bed is truly told, the validity of _his_ claim that Marx was Freddy’s father is open to doubt. Of the two, Engels himself is a better candidate than Karl, and he was indeed living in London at the relevant time, September-October 1850. The younger, unmarried and handsomer man was the one with a taste for girls, working-class ones at that, and Lenchen was his exact contemporary. Writing to Marx from Paris in 1847 Engels let rip about _grisettes_ – ‘easy’ working-class girls called after their cheap grey attire: ‘it is absolutely essential that you get out of boring Brussels for once and come to Paris, and I for my part have a great desire to go carousing with you ... If I had an income of 5000 francs I would do nothing but work and amuse myself with women until I went to pieces. If there were no Frenchwomen, life wouldn’t be worth living. But so long as there are _grisettes_, well and good!’ (38 CW 115).

By contrast Karl was notably struck on Jenny as his long-suffering wife; and from all accounts he was uxorious in the home – even if he did complain a bit in letters – and desperately anxious for a son. He mourned his two dead ones – Edgar or ‘Musch’ (_c_. December 1846- 6 April 1855) and Guido or ‘Föxchen’ (after the incendiary Catholic rebel Guido or ‘Guy’ Fox) (_c_. 31 October 1849 – _c_. late November 1850) – with particular bitterness. The younger boy had only recently died, and on the occasion of his third daughter Franziska’s birth he commented, ‘My wife, alas, has been delivered of a girl, and not a boy. And what is worse, she’s very poorly.’ When his last surviving child, Eleanor, was born in January 1855, he wrote to Engels, ‘my wife was delivered of a bona fide TRAVELLER – unfortunately of THE “SEX” _par excellence_. If it had been a male child, well and good’.

Lenchen and Frau Marx were very close – Lenchen was a link for Jenny with the von Westphalens and happier days – and Frau Marx was virtually all that Helene Demuth had in the world. The two no doubt spent more time together than Jenny spent with Karl, who devoted long hours to his work in the British Museum. It seems difficult to imagine Lenchen deceiving her mistress, and if violence were perpetrated on the maid by Karl, it seems difficult to imagine Jenny allowing the household to continue as if nothing had happened.

Marx’s wife Jenny complained on occasion about August Willich (1810-78), one of the expatriate ’48ers, saying that he was lurking around the household with seduction on his mind. Someone like that seems a better candidate for Freddy’s father than either Marx or Engels. At registration Freddy was named Henry, possibly after Karl Heinrich Marx, and Frederick, possibly after Friedrich Engels, who had no alternative Christian name but sometimes anglicized his own. The two were very possibly charged by the unhappy mother and her distraught mistress with doing the best they could for the infant – at a distance (38 CW 326; 39 CV 509; 1 K 21; KM 246-7).

The story of ‘Marx’s illegitimate son’ has been the most obvious reading of Louise’s ‘letter’. But the document should be particularly scrutinized for its allegations about Engels, namely his behaviour on his deathbed and before. In the ‘letter’ Louise says: ‘[Engels] said that he did not wish his name to be besmirched ... He had stood in for Marx in order to save him from a serious domestic quarrel ... I have seen the letter which Marx wrote to General [Engels’s nickname] in Manchester at the time ... I believe that he had this letter but, like so much of their correspondence, has destroyed it’ (R 134-8).

If Engels were genuinely worried at any stage that Freddy’s paternity would be laid at his door – and there is no evidence that he was – he would hardly have wanted to destroy the one piece of evidence that would have cleared him, as Louise’s ‘letter’ suggests. If, as seems more likely, he cared more for Marx’s name within the communist cause than for his own respectability, then – if there were a letter incriminating Marx – he might well have burnt it, but many years before Louise arrived in his household in 1890. However, there is little likelihood that on his deathbed Engels would suddenly demonstrate an overpowering concern for his own moral reputation in the shallowest sense, and then seek to salvage it from an entirely hypothetical attack, by imputing Freddy’s paternity to Marx. Indeed Engels took special care to provide for the Marx children, and if Freddy were one as well, Engels could easily have written another codicil and included him amongst the legatees. He would thus have protected himself from charges of ‘shabby treatment’ with substantial help rather than with unsubstantiated allegations.

Overall Engels was far more concerned for the good name of the communist movement, and for Marx’s good name first and foremost within it, than he was for his own. By the time he died he had devoted fifty years to this cause, and he is unlikely to have wanted to blacken Marx’s name for any reason whatsoever. The personal and the political were far too closely intertwined in his life to come apart so catastrophically, indeed they were virtually one and the same. Louise’s ‘letter’ is instructive because it illustrates precisely the kind of thing that he was _least_ likely to say. Political action played a large part in his personal relationships – what they were and how they were conducted – and indeed the idea of political action completely filled his personal life.

Heinrich Gemkow and Rolf Hecker have published a useful article which surveys and reproduces much of the material cited and excerpted above, together with a number of extracts from documents that are difficult to access and in some cases newly added to the list of materials relevant to the ‘Freddy affair’ (GH). In particular they focus attention on three letters from August Bebel to Eduard Bernstein (1850-1932), dated 8 and 18 September 1898, and 3 August 1899 (and on Bernstein’s replies of 11 and 18 September 1898). These are evidently part of the exchange of letters to which Louise’s (lost) original letter was directed, i.e. Bebel wrote to her (letter lost), she replied to him (apparent copy dated 2-4 September 1898). Gemkow and Hecker further consider a letter from Frederick Demuth to Jean-Laurent-Frederick Longuet (1876-1946) of 10 April 1912; a letter from David Borisovich Ryazanov (1870-1934), the director of the Marx-Engels-Institute and editor of the first Marx-Engels-_Gesamtausgabe_, to Clara Zetkin (1857-1933), dated 20 February 1929, and Zetkin’s reply of 27 February, written from Moscow where she was then living (GH 47). It is rather unclear from their text exactly which of these items was ‘unknown’ and in exactly what sense. While the authors admit that these materials offer no _conclusive_ proof that Marx was Frederick Demuth’s father, and while they note Bernstein’s scepticism on this point (in a previously ‘known’ letter), and refer to Kautsky’s (in a published article of 1929), they nonetheless regard this additional material as weighty enough to close the case (GH 45 n. 7, 49, 51).

The Bebel-Bernstein exchange of correspondence provides a context for Louise’s ‘letter’, namely the activities and thoughts of Bebel and Bernstein in the late summer and early autumn of 1898 when they were dealing with Edward Aveling’s estate (GH 47-50). Aveling had died on 2 August, having been in bad health for some time, one of the factors assumed to have been behind Eleanor Marx’s suicide on 31 March of the same year. Their involvement with Freddy and his (rather usual) attempts to gain money, one way or another, from the Marx family, are perhaps explained (at least in part) by some suggestion that one of the points at issue was a loan from Eleanor to Aveling, which could possibly be recovered in Freddy’s favour (GH 48). Freddy had not figured in Eleanor’s will, despite her declared affection for him (something which troubled Bernstein, who spoke rather ill of the dead on this matter), and as with the Engels estate, there was something of a pattern of trying to secure him some funds (GH 48). As Helene’s son, and friend of Eleanor and Laura, he was at least in that way a family-member. This correspondence was also the occasion for an exchange between Bebel and Bernstein about a possible closer (and scandalous) relationship to the Marx family, namely the ‘information’ (from Louise) that he was Marx’s son (and therefore Eleanor’s illegitimate half-brother). However, as the authors state, these documents provide no direct evidence on this point, other than a rehearsal of their varying opinions about this possibility (and their views on Louise’s reliability as an informant – about anything). The conclusion between them was that Freddy would be getting no money from the Aveling estate, at least through their offices, however needy or deserving he actually was (GH 49).

The letter from Frederick Demuth himself, some years later, to ‘Johnny’ Longuet (Jenny’s son), does not feature in Gemkow and Hecker’s arguments, as it merely relays the thoughts of a man in bad health who is, once again, asking for money, and they do not seem to take his own claim to be Marx’s son with any degree of seriousness (GH 50). In any case, the document relates no new information on the subject, beyond Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim, as recounted in the typewritten document from which the current controversy solely arises.

The Ryazanov-Zetkin exchange does actually add a new claim, namely that Zetkin herself, while present at Eleanor Marx’s house (apparently at the beginning of August 1896), was introduced by Eleanor to Freddy as her (i.e. Eleanor’s) ‘half-brother’ and ‘the son of Nymmy and Mohr [i.e. Marx]’. Zetkin also says that Eleanor said that she (i.e. Zetkin) ‘would know the history’ (GH 56-7). Curiously the authors do not focus much attention on this, even though it represents the first claim that someone, _other than Louise_ (who merely recounts _Engels’s_ alleged claim, and _her_ claim that Engels was telling the truth, and that others _knew_ the story), was told about this in direct terms of paternity _independently_ of Louise.

However, Zetkin’s narrative contains another ‘surprise’. According to her, Louise Kautsky (as she then was) turned up at Engels’s in 1890 about to become a ‘mother’ (i.e. pregnant), and her marriage to Dr. Ludwig Freyberger was rushed through on Engels’s doing in order to maintain respectability (GH 57-8). A fact not noted by Gemkow and Hecker is that Louise and Ludwig were married only in 1894, though the authors do comment on Zetkin’s speculations concerning the father of Louise’s baby. According to Zetkin the father was definitely not Ludwig, but could have been Bebel or Adler or Engels himself! (despite his advanced age). Gemkow and Hecker merely note that according to evidence from their correspondence Bebel and Adler were not in contact with Louise at the relevant time. Unmentioned, but certainly striking, is the fact that Zetkin’s is the sole account of all this scandal concerning _Louise_ and illegitimacy/fatherhood, for which nothing else survives or fits. This puts Zetkin rather in Louise’s camp as someone who exaggerates and creates fantasies, as Bernstein put it in 1898 (the first time round on this kind of scenario).

Zetkin’s concern in her letter seems to be political in a number of senses: she considers Marx, Engels, and Kautsky all to be cold and callous (males) in their evident disregard for Freddy, whether as infant, youth or adult, whatever his exact relationship to the Marx family; and she also considers Kautsky and Engels to be too influenced by bourgeois niceties and hypocrisies in these matters (and indeed she seems to see that class/gender fault as part and parcel with revisionism in the case of Kautsky) (GH 58). Zetkin also rather indirectly suggests (by giving us remarks she ascribes to Bebel) that Bernstein destroyed or censored letters from Marx to Engels (which could include the one in which the former apologises for asking the latter to accept paternity and thereby avoid a family row), whereas Louise seemed to think that that letter had already been destroyed by Engels (GH 56). Zetkin mentions Bernstein’s scepticism, which also surfaces in Kautsky’s article written about the time the two exchanged letters (and was then published on 20 February 1929), even though Zetkin seems to boast that she got the Marx/paternity story from ‘Kautsky himself’. However, she says that _he_ got the story from Bernstein, who is supposed to have made the crucial discovery of the letter (and then presumably reversed his earlier scepticism about the Freddy-Marx non-resemblance, though we have no record of any of this) (GH 50, 54). The authors note with some surprise Zetkin’s word-for-word recollections (at age 71) of social occasions at ‘Tussy’s’ (i.e. Eleanor’s) some 30 years before, but then according to Zetkin’s account, Eleanor had promised her a ‘surprise’, so it would have been quite memorable (GH 50). In short, Zetkin seems somewhat flawed and unreliable as a witness (rather like Louise), not least because she was writing 30 years after in overcharged circumstances and with certain battles on her mind. Despite her reference to _Eleanor_ as an independent source for the Freddy/Marx/paternity story (_other than Louise_), Zetkin’s account is very much framed _by_ Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim (and so does not count as fully independent corroboration).

The Gemkow/Hecker article displays some telling confusions:

- Engels’s presumed role in sorting out adoption is confused with Engels’s ‘assumption of paternity’, when the two should be clearly distinguished and separately evaluated.
- Engels’s (alleged) denial of his paternity for Freddy is logically separate from his (alleged) allegation of Marx’s, as he could certainly have been informed (enough) about the former, but mistaken (or less than fully informed, or indeed fictive) on the latter.
- The authors’ methodology is one of rediscovering or decoding ‘evidence’ based on reading Louise’s tale _into_ remarks that, ambiguous as they are, may well refer to other things; whereas the authors should _also_ be discussing ‘the case against’ the claim that these materials are indeed ‘evidence’ for the given hypothesis – in other words they are throughout the article given to assuming what needs to be proved.
- The validity criterion for establishing the truth, or at least the overwhelming likelihood, of the authors’ hypothesis (that Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim is accurate) is apparently a cumulative one, i.e. the more reference that can be found to those, particularly amongst respected socialists, who say that they believe it (or are said to say that they believe it), the more certain we can be that the hypothesis is the right one; whereas this ignores the common source for the entire affair, and also the hearsay and unsubstantiated claims that are made about who (else) knows the tale and believes it.

In what I hope is a scholarly manner, I summarise the case for, and the case against, in two paragraphs below, and then offer some further thoughts on the current state of scholarship in this area.

**Reasons for believing that Marx was Freddy’s father**:

- a circumstantial and reinterpretive ‘fit’ between Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim and various letters that survive;
- testimony in _their own_ letters that Bebel and Zetkin believed Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim based on their respective close relationships with Louise and Engels (Bebel) and with Eleanor Marx (Zetkin).

**Reasons for not believing that Marx was Freddy’s father**:

- no direct evidence that bears unambiguously on this matter;
- direct evidence from correspondence that those in contact with Freddy were not concerned with his paternity;
- direct evidence from correspondence that those concerned with the original ‘scandal’ were not at odds with each other from 1850 onwards;
- direct evidence that the 1895 Engels ‘deathbed’ revelations made no difference to those involved;
- no source for any concern about this issue other than Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim (in the 1890s and after the 1960s), other than the suggestion from Bebel that _Louise_ had told him something about Engels/Marx/Freddy in the early 1890s; the recollection from Zetkin that _Eleanor_ had told her that Marx was Freddy’s father; and Frederick’s self-interested and otherwise unsupported claim to be ‘the son of the great Marx’;
- lack of recorded comment on the subject from numerous people who are all said (by Louise or Zetkin) ‘to know’, e.g. Frau Marx, Moore, Eleanor Marx, the Lafargues, Jenny (Marx) Longuet, Engels, Ludwig Freyberger, Lessner, Pfänder, Parvus [pseud. Alexander Lazarevich Gel’fand or Helphand], Tanya Helfand [Parvus’s wife], ‘a friend of Bernstein’s’ etc. ... other than the self-declared sceptics Bernstein and Kautsky (in so far as we have their directly recorded comments, which neither Louise nor Zetkin take up directly);
- Bernstein (in 1898) and Kautsky (in 1929) say directly that they don’t believe Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim, or that they are not convinced by what they’ve heard of it, giving their reasons (e.g. that it was out of character for Marx, and that Louise’s character lent itself to fantasy);
- confusion about the one (supposed) letter that would confirm the ‘Engels accepted paternity to get Marx off the marital hook’ thesis (of course, Freddy’s father might really be someone else anyway, even if Marx had had an affair and thought he was the father, and so wanted to ‘transfer’ this to Engels);
- Louise had 52 more years in which to tell the tale, and no obvious reason why not (i.e. unlike Zetkin, she was not a political figure, nor even a party stalwart).

In short, all roads in this matter lead back to Louise (save for Zetkin’s story about Eleanor’s ‘surprise’, and even that surfaces in a context influenced by Louise) and to Louise’s apparent interest in safeguarding Engels’s ‘good name’ and presumably his money albeit very retrospectively. Possibly there is also an element here of Louise’s concern to cause trouble for Eleanor, even after the latter’s death, in conjunction with the estate of her ‘partner’ Aveling, by making difficulties there and saddling Eleanor with a bastard brother (whom Engels evidently didn’t like, on Eleanor’s testimony). The gossip and scandal, such as we have it, all dates from 1898 (according to surviving materials, which have no anomalies solely soluble in terms of Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim).

I suggest the following methodological principles for investigation of the ‘Freddy affair’:

1. no reading of Louise’s tale into the evidence without rigorous testing as to whether other circumstances fit equally well or better.
2. rigorous separation of factual and hearsay claims, and testing of these separately, e.g. what does _Louise_ say and should we believe it? what does _Engels_ (supposedly) say and should we believe it? What does anyone else actually say _in their own words and from their own experience_?
3. source material should be reproduced in full, rather than excerpted, not least to establish the context of remarks, i.e. what questions the writers are asking and answering and with what result in mind, which is seldom the same as a (much later) scholarly enquiry into a (not very simple) fact. (In a short article, of course, this is not always possible; however, I am aiming to collect all the relevant documents for publication in full in English translation.)
4. due attention to the commonplace idea (as it was then before DNA testing, anyway) that ‘maternity is a fact, and paternity is an opinion’! We have no testimony at all from the one person whose account would command special credence – _Helene Demuth_ – even if there might still be room for doubt about her exact knowledge or veracity. I suspect what concerns contemporary scholars is the answer to a different question: did Marx have an affair with, or perpetrate violence on, the housemaid? Again the one person whose account would command special credence has apparently left us nothing.

##### Conclusion

We will never know about this ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. Why we should care is another question. Marx might appear a model family man, in a qualified sense (given his need to ‘do right’ by them all in a bourgeois world), but has there been an industry devoted to projecting him in the guise of model heterosexual male? He was notably low key on these issues (though not entirely silent; see P-MMx ch. 9).

Moreover, if Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim is accepted as read, Engels emerges as shabby, shallow and pathetic, and there is some implied criticism of him along these lines in the Bebel-Bernstein exchanges as they consider the possibilities and consequences of Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim. Engels may very well have been that way late in life (or indeed somewhat earlier), but it is in some ways more shocking, given his youthful polemics against the ‘bourgeois family’, an area where Marx had rather less to say (and also, so far as we know, rather less to do in terms of ‘womanizing’, given his long courtship and ‘childhood sweethearts’ sexual trajectory; see PMMx ch. 10).

At this stage of the investigation I am personally more persuaded by Bernstein’s view in 1898 (the father was someone unacceptable to the family) and by Kautsky’s comments in 1929 (Marx’s paternity of Frederick was ‘wholly improbable’) than to Louise’s account/Engels’s alleged claim. It fits much more plausibly with the correspondence, events, feelings and character of everyone concerned ... except Louise’s. While it is difficult to see quite why Louise would deliberately construct such a spiteful tale, it is significant that there was scepticism about it amongst the inner circle at the time (as well as credence). There is an undoubted element of gossipy invention and speculation in the document, anyway, which even Louise’s most ardent supporters (such as Yvonne Kapp, Eleanor Marx’s biographer) have had to acknowledge. However powerful the tale, and however well it ‘seems to fit’ into other ambiguities, historians and scholars have a duty to formulate clear hypotheses and to mount clearly constructed tests.

In sum, historians and biographers should sharpen up the tools of their trade, and not be seduced by the evident narrative power of gossip and scandal, however much they are vicariously involved with their socialist celebrities.

There is a bulky output of literature alleging that Marx’s essay _On the Jewish Question_ is anti-Semitic because it equates Jewry with the spirit of money-making, the merchant-huckster, preoccupation with self-interest and egoism - that is, with the commercialism of the new bourgeois order. The charge has been furthered in various ways, including forgery: one honest critic renamed the essay _A World Without Jews_ as if this were Marx’s title. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n1) Few discussions of the essay explain clearly its political purpose and content in connection with the Jewish emancipation question, or even accurately present the views of its target, Bauer. Mainly, the allegation is supported by reading the attitudes of the second half of the twentieth century back into the language of the 1840s. More than that, it is supported only if the whole course of German and European anti-Jewish sentiment is whitewashed, so as to make Marx’s essay stand out as a black spot. This note will take up only the 1843 essay and its background.

The general method was memorably illustrated in C.B. Kelland’s 1936 novel _Mr. Deeds Goes to Town_, which some may know as a Gary Cooper film. In an attempt to have a hearing declare Mr. Deeds of unsound mind, two little old ladies are brought in from his home town to testify. It’s well known, one explains, that he is pixillated – balmy in the head. The honest woman’s evidence seems damning. But the case blows up later when she is asked one more question: “Who else in your town is pixillated?” She answers: “Why, _everybody!_”

As soon as the question is raised, it is not difficult or even controversial to show that virtually the entire population of Germany (and the rest of Europe, too) was pixillated-that is, habitually used and accepted the words _Jew_ and _Jewry_ in the manner of Marx’s essay whether they were favorable to the Jews’ cause or not, whether they were anti-Semitic or not, whether they were Jews or not. In this they were only following the very old, if now discredited, practice of using national and ethnic names as epithets, usually derogatory, for people showing a trait supposedly characteristic of the nation or ethnic group. This practice, which began to be suppressed in self-consciously polite society only a few decades ago, was as common in English as in any other language, and some of it still hangs on. Consider a few: _wild Indian_ (active child), _apache_ (Paris criminal), _Hottentot_ (as in _Hottentot morality_), _street arab_, _gypsy_, _bohemian_, _Cossack_, _blackamoor_, _Turk_; or, as an adjective: _Dutch courage_, _Mexican general_, _French leave_. Another of this group, for centuries, has been _Jew_.

#### 1. The Pattern in Germany

Marx’s essay represents a very attenuated form of the general pattern, for most commonly _Jew_ was a synonym for _usurer_, whereas by this time mere money-making was eminently respectable. [[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n2) Bauer’s writing assumed that _Jew_ meant usurer – quite in passing, for he was not interested in the economic Jew but in the “Sabbath Jew”. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n3) The same economic stereotype of the Jew can be found in Arnold Ruge [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n4), who remained a liberal and never became a communist, as well as in Max Stirner [[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n5), whose book _The Ego and Its Own_ heralded anarchism. These names already cover the spectrum of the Young Hegelian milieu, whose philosophic mentor Feuerbach provided the immediate example for this language about the role of Jewry. [[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n6)

A special case, near if not in the Young Hegelian tendency, was Moses Hess: conscientiously Jewish himself, Hess had been brought up in an orthodox household and later became the progenitor of Zionism. It is well known that the language of Marx’s Part II of _On the Jewish Question_ followed the view of the Jews’ role given in an essay _On the Money System_ just written by none other than Hess, and just read by Marx. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n7)

Hess’s thesis was that present-day society was a “huckster world”, a “social animal-world”, in which people become fully developed “egoists”, beasts of prey and bloodsuckers. “The _Jews_”, wrote the father of Zionism, “who in the natural history of the social animal-world had the _world-historic_ mission of developing the _beast of prey_ out of humanity have now finally completed _their mission’s work_.” It was in the “Judeo-Christian huckster world” that “the mystery of the _blood of Christ_, like the mystery of the _ancient Jewish blood-worship_, finally appears quite unmasked as the _mystery of the beast of prey_.” There is more verbiage, going back to the “blood-cult” of ancient Judaism as the prototype of modern society, and on to a condemnation of priests as the “hyenas of the social animal-world” who are as bad as the other animal-people by virtue of their “common quality as beasts of prey, as bloodsuckers, as Jews, as financial wolves”. [[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n8) Earlier in 1843 Hess had published an important article on _The Philosophy of Action_, which only incidentally remarked that “The Christian God is an imitation of the Jewish Moloch-Jehovah, to whom the first-born were sacrificed to ‘propitiate’ him, and whom the _juste-milieu_ age of Jewry bought off with money ...” [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n9) Hess intended no special anti-Jewish animus in any of this stuff, compared to which Marx’s approach is complimentary and drily economic. Note that Judaism is criticized as part of the Judeo-Christian complex, and not in order to praise Christianity – this being the same pattern as Voltaire’s; although Hess saw no contradiction between his own continued Jewish faith and loyalties and his opinion, expounded in his writings, that Christianity was the more advanced, modern and “pure” religion – all in the Feuerbachian groove. [[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n10)

It is relevant to add that much of the economic-Jew stereotype had at this time gained general _Jewish_ acceptance, at least as applied to rich Jews: so one can learn from the best German historian of anti-Semitism, Eleonore Sterling. [[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n11)

If we move outside Young Hegelian circles, we may note that two other famous Jews of the period are no exception to the rule: Lassalle [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n12) and Heine. Heine is especially interesting, as always. His article on the Damascus affair of 1840 – one of the famous frameups of Jews on the “blood” accusation – is full of bitter indignation against the French Jews for lack of concern over their victimized brethren abroad. “Among the French Jews, as with other Frenchmen,” wrote Heine (in France), “gold is the god of the time, and industry is the prevailing religion.” Baron Rothschild and the noted Jewish plutocrat Fould are called “two distinguished rabbis of finance”. Heine says caustically, “I do not believe that Israel ever gave money, save when its teeth were drawn by force. . . . There are, of course, now and then examples that vanity can open the obdurate pockets of Jews, but then their liberality is more repulsive than their meanness.” [[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n13) (At this point the American translator was moved to apologize for Heine’s language, for by this time, 1891, the modern racist type of anti-Semitism was over a decade old; in 1840 it had no such significance or motivation.) An excellent study by William Rose gives the context of Heine’s aphorism that “The Jews were the Germans of the Orient, and now the Protestants in the Germanic countries ... are nothing else than old-oriental Jews.” [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n14) Rose naturally makes clear Heine’s polyvalence about Jewry _(ambivalence_ would be too weak).

As for other products of the Hegelian school, farther right, D.F. Strauss [[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n15) was _more_ virulently anti-Jewish than those mentioned; and the famous Hegelian scholar Eduard Gans, whose lectures Marx attended at the university, was another Jewish case in point. Indeed, Gans’s case can be considered a symbol. When Marx came to the University of Berlin in 1836, Gans (in jurisprudence) was the big Hegelian influence on the faculty. Seventeen years before, Gans had helped Leopold Zunz found the first society for Jewish studies in the world, of which he became president. The project bogged down because the rich Jews whom they had counted on refused to dip into their pockets. Zunz cried that Jewry was beyond reform, “the prey of barbarians, fools, moneylenders, and _parnasim_” (synogogue money-men), “slaves of mere self-interest ... a pap of praying, bank notes, and charity.” But he plugged on. President Gans reported: “The only link which unites the Jews is fear; the only interest for which they are willing to part with some of their worldly goods is charity” – whereupon he went through the baptism route from the _cheder_ to the _Katheder_. But even earlier, in the society’s journal, Gans had had no inhibition against remarking that “Jewish life” reflected a “double aristocracy whose component parts ... are ... money and rabbis.” [[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n16)

Hegel himself had written along the same lines mainly in early works, that is, before his Prussian conservatization. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n17) This was no paradox. It was the conservative right that usually expressed antipathy to Jewry in religious and racialist terms; it was the left-of-center that put the spotlight on the _economic_ role of Jewry, the economic Jews; and both stereotypes flourished among peasants and other poor victims of the system. Fichte, another source of philosophic radicalism, deserved the name of systematic anti-Semite more than any so far mentioned. [[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n18)

If we move to anti-Establishment dissent to the right of the Young Hegelians and their circle, we find that the Young Germany movement, through the pens of its leader Karl Gutzkow and prominent literary light Heinrich Laube, wrote no differently about the Jews, and at some length. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n19)  
 

#### 2. The Universality of Pixillation

In the 1840s both sides, for and against political emancipation, held the economic image of the Jew as common ground. The strong bourgeois-liberal movement pressing for Jewish rights was quite vocal in arguing that civil emancipation was necessary in order to solve the Jewish question by dissolving Jewry as a recognizable entity into the general pool of Germanness and thus eventually eliminating it. Hess himself had presented this viewpoint in his most successful book, in 1841. [[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n20) Says Gustav Mayer of the pro-Jewish liberals: “Only through full and equal rights, they believed, would it be possible to wean away the Prussian Jews from their un-German customs and from their one-sided preference for petty trade.” [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n21)

Glickson, in the course of an indignant harangue against Marx, lets slip the following statement: “It is a well-known fact that the contemporary masters of philosophy and literature, with the single exception of Lessing, had no sympathy for Jews or Judaism. The greatest of them taught that the Jews were foreign and different, and drew definite political conclusions from these teachings. Goethe, the great world-citizen, strongly opposed the liberation of the Jews; he saw in them heretics who deny ‘the source of our high culture’.” [[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n22) Goethe had worse and stupider things to say about the Jews than this, including of course the commercial stereotype. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n23) Lessing, the alleged “single exception”, had been dead for sixty-two years and was hardly a contemporary; we will come back to this mythical exception. (_Why, everybody’s pixillated!_)

Silberner, who writes as a prosecuting attorney, eventually makes the following remark: “The most various writers could indeed have reinforced Marx’s prejudice against the Jews. Many representatives of German classical literature and philosophy were not precisely fond of the Jews, and since he read much of them, they could have contributed to his Judeophobia.” [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n24) Silberner does not mention any who _were_ “fond of the Jews”, including Jews. All of German history exists, for him, only as an influence on Marx. This bizarre approach is due to the understandable reluctance, shown by him and similar writers, to inform the modern reader that so many great men either disliked the Jews or thought of them in terms of the economic stereotype, for fear of reinforcing contemporary anti-Semitic currents by giving them respectable sanction. It is only Marx who is to be accused of being pixillated.

As Roman Rosdolsky said of this modus operandi, “In this manner one could very easily assign to the camp of anti-Semitism three-quarters of the thinkers, writers, and politicians of the past.” [[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n25) If we consider only left-of-center circles, the proportion would be closer to 100 percent, since it is on the left, rather than on the right, that the _economic_ structure and role of Jewry was the main operative factor.

All this was not only true of Germany. In France and England the economic stereotype of the Jew and its expression in leftish circles was similar; we are not dealing with a phenomenon of the German soul. France was worse.

An essay by Z. Szajkowski is illuminating on the subject of France. It reports at the end that it is impossible to find _any_ “sympathetic reference to the Jews in the French socialist literature, from Saint-Simon to the date of Drumont’s first appearance [1886]”. For the most part, what this involved was the stereotyped identification of Jews with money values and economic exploitation. More virulent attitudes existed among the Fourierists especially. The tradition of dislike for Jewish economic activities goes back in France not simply to Voltaire but to the history of Jewry in the later Middle Ages and the Enlightenment. [[26]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n26)

In France, indeed, one first finds a new note: here Jew-hatred took a proto-Nazi form in the express desire of Proudhon (father of anarchist “libertarianism”) for the physical extermination of all Jews. Bakunin, the other father of anarchism, was almost as virulently anti-Semitic in the modern sense as Proudhon. [[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n27) But in this period, this proto-Nazi anti-Semitism is found only among these anarchist liberty-shouters, as far as I know.

England was by no means as bad as France. But routine equation of the economic Jew with money-bags, financial overlords, commercial exploitation, and the rest, cropped up in the Chartist press, including the best of the left Chartists [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n28), in the manner of Marx’s essay. To take another part of the political spectrum: Macaulay can be viewed as an English example of the liberal _supporter_ of Jewish civil emancipation who expressed as much aversion to Jewish economic activities as many an opponent. [[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n29) The jibes at the economic Jew stereotype are not at all peculiar to socialist writings: they are found wherever there is expression of antagonism to the bourgeois or financial world. The reactionary antibourgeois critic Thomas Carlyle was not only virulently anti-Jewish but also opposed the granting of greater legal rights to the Jews. [[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n30)

But it would be a complete misunderstanding of the economic-Jew stereotype if it is identified with an anti-Jewish context only. Leaving aside the advocates of Jewish emancipation who used language similar to Marx’s essay just as automatically as its opponents, it is instructive to look at the first _Jewish_ socialist movement which began stirring in the latter 1870s.

This is three decades later than the period of Marx’s essay; the whole basis of awareness of the Jewish question has been transformed by the rise of a systematically racist anti-Semitic movement for the first time; we are dealing with Jewish-conscious socialists reacting to a _real_ anti-Semitic threat; and by this time there is something of a Jewish proletariat in existence. Everything is different; but still, consider the terms of the first socialist manifesto issued to Jewry, by Aaron Lieberman, the historic pioneer of this movement. His _Call to the Jewish Youth_ reverberated with the tones of Isaiah (as in _Isaiah 2: 7-9_, for example). It said: “Emancipate yourselves from the power-lust that lies at the bottom of your privileges. Stop praying to gold and might.” Lieberman blames the Jewish bankers and merchants for the plight of his people:

We have had to pay for your sins! The race hatred, the religious hatred, with all their terrors have fallen mostly upon us [the poor Jews]. You kindled the fire that devours us. We have you to thank for it that the name Israel has become a curse. The entire Jewish people, suffering and astray, must suffer more than all other peoples because of your greed. It is your fault that we have been exposed to calumny. International speculators, who have dragged our name through the mud, you do not belong to us! [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n31)

The power of the traditional stereotype is recognized here precisely by the justified fervor of the plea to repudiate it, to emphasize the class struggle _within_ Jewry in order to exorcize it. There is a historical background to this.

#### 3. Roots of the Economic Jew

We have assumed up to now that the reader has a general conception of the economic history behind the stereotype – at any rate, how Jews were forced into a lopsided economic structure by Christendom’s prohibition on their entrance into agriculture, guild occupations, and professions. Three myths about the economic Jew are easy to refute but not germane here; they are: (1) that Jews _controlled_ finance or any part of economic life; (2) that _all_ Jews were rich; and (3) that it was the Jews that created, or invented, capitalism. After these myths are disposed of, however, the real historical basis of the economic Jew can be broached. Something else was involved beyond these exaggerations, and may be summarized as follows:

1. The important role that the (upper stratum of) Jews did play in the development of postfeudal society, especially considering the tiny proportion of the population they constituted.
2. The great tilt in the economic structure of Jewry toward middleman and financial occupations, including the bulk of _poor_ Jews in huckstering occupations, for example, peddlers, petty merchants.
3. The relatively high visibility of the Jews’ economic role – as, for example, when Junkers employed Jews as loan collectors and mortgage foreclosers, thus gaining the profits while the Jews gained the onus as “bloodsuckers”.

In 1843 little was known, even to those aware of the question, about the economic or sociohistorical development of the Jewish people. The very concept of a _Wissenschaft des Judentums_ (Jewish studies) had arisen only in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Today there is a considerable literature on the question [[32]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n32), but it is ahistorical to predate its acquisition. A portion of that history which is important background for our present subject is well summarized in Sterling’s _Judenhass_, which deals precisely with Germany in the years 1815-1850:

The enlightened officials recognized, already in the middle of the eighteenth century, the useful and progressive function of the Jews in the development of commerce and industry, which tended to transform the still seminatural-economy state into a modern money- and credit-economy state. The princes summoned Jews to their courts in order to carry out the financing of their provinces independently of the Estates, in order to obtain moneys for raising and maintaining their armies, and to make possible the operation of new businesses. In this way was formed a small rich and politically privileged upper stratum within the Jewish population. Jewish court agents, bankers, and army contractors assumed an important position in finance, in commerce and in the industry of the mercantilist-oriented states. When the economic upswing set in after the Napoleonic war, many Christians as well as Jews found themselves in an advantageous position because they had large amounts of liquid capital at their disposal. Still their number must have been slight ...

In the course of time arose a new but also not numerous group of Jews who became well-to-do through the new economic development. Unhindered by old traditions and guild regulations, they quickly adopted the methods of the modern English credit system and stock speculation. They understood how to turn out large quantities of goods produced in the new factories for the market, got in position to give state loans, and participated in railroad construction and built factories.

In that way the real security of the Jews essentially depended on their usefulness to others and on the good will of the governments; all their enterprises, indeed their very existence, remained always in jeopardy. They therefore attempted with great energy to compensate with economic power for the legal and social security they lacked. In this way the Jewish financiers who had grown rich in the new capitalist order, in which money was all-powerful, achieved a “privileged” position ...

In the sections where capitalist commerce and industry had already made important progress even without Jews, the Christian population by no means felt that the success of the Jewish upper stratum was a handicap for themselves. Thus, already in 1817 the _Gewerbepolizei_ in Aachen said that Jewish business in the Prussian Rhineland could no longer be considered “usury” but a synonym for free trade and the profit system. [[33]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n33)

Such favorable attitudes were not taken, however, by merchants’ corporative guilds and the patrician order in the smaller German states and backward areas, not to speak of the peasantry and artisanry.

It is clear why the spearhead of the Jewish emancipation drive, the petition campaign,

came mostly from the big-bourgeois circles of the cities in which industrial development was already far advanced and in which the Jews of the bourgeois upper stratum already played an integrating function in the economy. It was Christian and Jewish great merchants, factory owners, bankers, and insurance directors who drafted the petitions and submitted them with numerous signatures. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n34)

This was the nature of the emancipation campaign which Marx supported and Bauer attacked.

But it would be a mistake to believe that the economic-Jew stereotype among the population was merely a reflection of this upper stratum, of the Rothschilds and Foulds. Many or most of the _poor_ Jews also functioned as middlemen – peddlers, hawkers, hand-to-mouth traders and merchants, petty money-lenders – in very direct contact with the poor Christian population, caught in the classic pattern of having to squeeze those below as they were squeezed from above. Jews were associated with “financial exploitation” on levels far below Rothschild: “Recent happenings in the Rhineland and Alsace,” relates Solomon Bloom, “strengthened this popular suspicion; Jewish moneylenders broke up properties of landlords and farmers at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Western radical community was not unaffected by the resulting animosities.” Gustav Mayer says, of anyone brought up in the young Marx’s place and time: “’The Jews’ to him meant mainly the Jewish cattle dealers in the Rhineland, those who bought from, and sold to the small peasants, taking advantage of their own superior business abilities.” [[35]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n35)

For our present purposes it is not necessary to settle the controversy over just how important the Jews were in the rise of capitalism. The identification of Jewry with commercialism, which was everybody’s pixillation in the 1840s, was elaborated in great detail as late as 1911 by Werner Sombart’s _The Jews and Modern Capitalism_; and after all the nonsense in that erudite opus is discounted, there is more than enough left to explain the mind of a generation that existed before economic history had even been invented.

#### 4. Ex Post Facto Anti-Semitism

After the rise of Hitlerism, it became _de rigueur_ to play down the Jews’ significance for capitalism, since the Nazis used it for their own purposes. [[36]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n36) But eminent Jewish historians have proudly lauded their role. In his introduction to Ruppin’s _The Jews in the Modern World_, for example, Professor L.B. Namier, writing militantly as a Zionist Jew and a true-blue Englishman, boasted: “Two races [_sic_] headed the movement [of progress in the capitalist system] though under vastly different conditions – the British and the Jews; they were the pioneers of capitalism, and its first, and perhaps chief, beneficiaries.” For others, that picture was considered to hold only until about the middle of the nineteenth century, which thoroughly covers Marx’s essay. [[37]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n37)

A. Leon has argued, against Sombart and others, that Jewry played such a role in _pre-_capitalist society:

Judaism was an indispensable factor in precapitalist society. It was a fundamental organism within it. That is what explains the two-thousand year existence of Judaism in the Diaspora. The Jew was as characteristic a personage in feudal society as the lord and the serf. It was no accident that a foreign element played the role of “capital” in feudal society ... The “capital” of precapitalist society existed outside of its economic system. [[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n38)

But, continues Leon’s thesis, the rise of capitalism to dominance in the social system went hand in hand with the _decline_ of Jewry in this function. Thereupon the Jews were pushed more and more into the interstices of the system, especially in a capacity as distribution middlemen and as usurers dealing more with the poor than with kings, as formerly. “In the measure that usury became the principal occupation of Jews, they entered increasingly into relations with the popular masses, and these relations worsened all the time.” The peasant who lost his land or stock, or the artisan who lost his tools, to the Jewish money-lender, was incapable of seeing the upper-bourgeois Christians behind the usurer; hatreds were let loose on the highly visible intermediaries. [[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n39) Leon’s term for Jewry, the _people-class_, is an attempt to give scientific form to the social basis of what we have been calling the economic-Jew stereotype. [[1*]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#na)

Leon aimed at a Marxist analysis; but we can turn to a leading theoretician of Socialist Zionism for confirmation, from an entirely different angle, of the effective universality of the old equation for which Marx’s essay gets denounced. Hayim Greenberg, writing in 1942, was disturbed about the use made by Nazi anti-Semitism of the _facts_ of the Jews’ economic role. He denies “the old charge that Jews are parasites in the world’s economic order” by arguing that the economic role which Jewry was forced into was in fact useful, honorable, and nothing to apologize for. He concludes that “There is nothing wicked in being a middleman, but it is not sound for a whole people to consist of middlemen.” What Greenberg is trying to say is that it is no more wicked to be a Jewish middleman than a Christian one. All of which was true, of course, as Marx had demonstrated in his own way by transforming the issue from the _contrast_ of Jews to Christians into the _economic equivalence_ of Jews and Christians. In the course of this defense, however, Greenberg testifies to the universality of pixillation – in queasy terms which, it must be remembered, are being written by a Zionist champion a hundred years after Marx’s essay and over a decade after the rise of Nazism:

Jews also have been considerably influenced by the notion that they constitute an unproductive, or even a destructive force, in the world’s economy. We speak of Jews as essentially a people of ... individuals whose occupations are unsubstantial, who are exploiters, speculators and traffickers in the labor of others.

Signs of this self-condemnation first appear in the literature of our “enlightenment”. Jews who felt spiritually emancipated from the civilization of the ghetto even before they were emancipated from its legal disabilities, developed a great admiration for European culture and were in no small degree affected by its anti-Jewish prejudices. Certainly they shared the European’s disdain for the Jew as a trader.

By 1942 all this had become anti-Semitic by ex post facto determination; but note that Greenberg was not so ignorant or hypocritical as to pretend that he had Marx in mind:

The views of many Jewish socialists in regard to the economic role of the Jews have also been tinged by a certain anti-Semitic bias ...

Non-Jewish socialists, and not necessarily Marxian socialists, have tended to look down on the Jew in the world’s economy.

He cites the Russian Narodnaya Volya, the peasant-oriented populist-terrorist movement of the late nineteenth century, which was even known to encourage peasant pogroms as one activity in their struggle. The Populists, he explains, held “the idea that the Jew was essentially a ‘bloodsucker’,” and adds: “This also explains Tolstoy’s rather unfriendly attitude towards the Jews, an attitude most eloquently expressed by his repeated failure to speak up on behalf of the persecuted Jews.” There goes another pixillated “libertarian”. But Greenberg goes further: to the Zionist socialists themselves _and_ their left wing:

Nor is Zionism free from its share of responsibility. There was a time when it used to be the fashion for Zionist speakers (including the writer) to declare from the platform that “to be a good Zionist one must first be somewhat of an anti-Semite”. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n41)

Greenberg states that this attitude can be found in Pinsker, Syrkin, Borochov, A.D. Gordon, and others – all of them the leaders and founders of the Labor Zionist movement. “To this day,” he adds, “Labor Zionist circles are under the influence of the idea that the Return to Zion involves a process of purification from our economic uncleanness.” [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n42) It should be added that the movement’s social-democratic theoretician, Ber Borochov, based his whole theory of Socialist Zionism on a class analysis of the Jewish people along the now-interdicted (”anti-Semitic”) lines, and that his fundamental “Marxist” argument for Zionism was that it was the only road to changing the class composition of the Jews. The same goes for his successor as the theoretician of Socialist Zionism, Nachman Syrkin. [[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n43)

It cannot be overemphasized that all of this, for which Greenberg beats his breast, was a matter of contrasting the economic Jew with the Christian world to the Jews’ _discredit_; for this bolstered the Zionist aim of making the Jews “a people like other people”. None of this sort of thing was in Marx’s 1843 essay, which repudiated such a derogatory contrast by already _identifying_ modern (bourgeois) Christendom with the commercial role of what Leon called the people-class.

While we have shown that this identification was in no way peculiar to Marx but was the common coin of the time – and it was precisely for this reason that Marx could turn it to account in order to make his political point – we must now go a little further along these lines. This identification was not merely generally accepted, but had been built into the language. McLellan goes so far as to put it this way:

_Judentum_, the German word for Judaism, had the derivative meaning of “commerce”, and it is this meaning which is uppermost in Marx’s mind throughout the article. “Judaism” has very little religious, and still less racial, content for Marx and it would be little exaggeration to say that this latter part of Marx’s review [Part II of _On the Jewish Question_] is an extended pun at Bauer’s expense. [[44]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n44)

This pun was not a jest but a play on words. Such word-play was indeed a favorite literary pattern of the young Marx, as it was of Hegel. In both it was not a humorous but an explicatory device: a means of developing, out of the different aspects of meaning packed into one word, various aspects of the reality which the word reflected.

Ruppin states that “in the Middle Ages the conceptions of Jew and trader became well-nigh synonymous.” Gustav Mayer makes a similar statement: “to the average German, Judaism and capitalism came pretty close to being synonymous.” Sterling quotes the economist Friedrich Harkort at the time, on the fact that behind the Jewish money-lenders and mortgage collectors stood the Junkers, who made the profit. These Junkers Harkort called “the Jews with boots and spurs” who constituted the real speculators and grasping creditors. [[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n45) The synonymy of Jew and some form of commercialism was taken for granted not only by those who threw epithets at the Jews but equally by those who defended them.

With this background in mind, one can go back to Marx’s _On the Jewish Question_ to read it as it was written, not as it is refracted through the dark glass of contemporary ignorance and malice.

It was a contribution to a hotly fought campaign in favor of Jewish political emancipation – not however on behalf of the “Christian and Jewish great merchants, factory owners, bankers, and insurance directors who drafted the petitions,” but to show how to link this current battle up with the eventual struggle _against_ these very gentlemen. Its aim was to support political emancipation today in order to make possible social emancipation tomorrow. Hence its last words: “The _social_ emancipation of the Jew is the _emancipation of society from Judaism_.”

These compact words do in fact sum up the entire burden of the argument: It is wrong to make the political emancipation of the Jew wait on his social emancipation (as Bauer wanted); for we are dealing with the economic Jew, and economic Judaism is now one with bourgeois society as a whole.

#### 5. How to Manufacture Anti-Semites

It should be clear now that there were two quite different issues involved in attitude toward the Jews, from the period of the Enlightenment to at least the 1870s (when anti-Semitism first became a racialist social and political movement and indeed the term itself was invented – by anti-Semites). One issue involved an opinion about _das Judentum_ [[2*]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#nb) (like or dislike); the other, a position on the status of Jews in the state and society (abolition of civic, legal, political disabilities). As we have seen, a dim view of Jewry was well-nigh universal, in some not-always- clear sense and for varying reasons, but with clear roots in the nature of “economic Judaism”. The division in public opinion occurred on the second issue, the question of political emancipation and equal rights.

As a result there is a curious system common among historians, not to speak of marxologists. Historical figures are made into “philo-Semites” or “anti-Semites” at will by referring only to one or the other issue, with the same obtuse lack of distinction that was so characteristic of the people of that benighted era itself. A couple of examples will give a proper perspective on the treatment of Marx’s essay.

We saw that Glickson (p.595) had looked for a single exception among the contemporary masters to the general lack of sympathy for Jews, and had gone back to the previous century to turn one up: G.E. Lessing, whose poetic drama _Nathan the Wise_ (1779) was the most renowned “philo-Semitic” production in Germany, perhaps in European history. This reputation is based on the sympathetic portrayal of Nathan as _Edeljude_, the noble Jew, good and wise. This reputation brought down on Lessing’s head the vituperation of generations of anti-Semites-for example, Nazi-like ravings by E. Dühring in 1881. [[Den dialektiske materialismes ABC-1721248246487.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n46) Without derogating Lessing’s contribution for its time, a closer look at the play produces a strange result if it is counterposed to Marx’s essay.

1. Lessing’s play does not raise the question of equal rights for Jews; to the contrary, it takes their inferior status for granted. For the setting is Saladin’s Jerusalem, where both Jews and Christians exist on the sufferance of Saladin, who is portrayed as being just as noble as Nathan.
2. Lessing’s chosen model, Nathan, is a rich Jewish merchant who has just returned from a debt-collecting trip, bringing back a fabulous wealth of goods. He is so rich that he is capable of playing the part of Rothschild to the sultan. In short, he is the worse of the two stereotypes of the economic Jew, not the poor-huckster model but the financial-plutocrat model. Lessing does not challenge the stereotype; he gilds it. He glorifies his rich Jew by painting him in pleasing colors.
3. Nathan is a Jew by birth but not by belief in Judaism, being in fact a Deist, like Lessing himself. He explains in a parable (which is the ideological centerpiece of the play and was its starting point in Lessing’s mind) that the three religions are as like as identical rings; the only difference is that one happens to inherit one rather than the other. The repugnance the wise Nathan would feel for Jewish orthodoxy is left implicit but is unquestionable.
4. The point is repeatedly made that Nathan is an _exceptional_ Jew. Repeatedly “Jew” is used generically to refer to the usual mean; miserly, money-mad Jew of the popular language. The noble Sittah twice wonders whether Nathan is a Jew like other Jews or whether he is good as reported; the noble Templar wonders whether Nathan has really unlearned “to be a Jew”; and the noble Nathan himself, wondering at one point what game the sultan is playing with him, soliloquizes, “Who here is really the Jew – he or I?” (To be sure, Lessing does not refer to “the dirty Jews”; instead, he refers just as routinely to “the dirty Moors”, the contemporaneous equivalent of “dirty niggers”.) [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n47)

In short, the great “philo-Semitic” message of the play is the equivalent of “Some of my best friends are Jews”, or even “You would hardly believe he’s a Jew, my dear!” In fact, Lessing had written it down himself, in an early (1749), “philo-Semitic” comedy called _The Jews_: “Truly there are Jews who aren’t Jews at all.” [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n48) Replying to a critic who urged that the noble-Jew figure was so great an improbability as to invalidate the play, Lessing vigorously agreed the case was rare, but argued that, since the Jews’ unfortunate condition was due to their necessity for “living purely and simply from trade”, it would cease with the cause, when the Jews no longer “maintain a wretched existence through base small trade”. Hence, he explained, he chose a rich man as his figure. [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n49) Lessing’s views revolved around the economic-Jew stereotype as completely as anyone’s.

The single exception in a hundred years, Lessing, turns out to have used _Jude_ as the same generic cuss-word as every other pixillated German and European. In contrast, Marx used _Judentum_ as an impersonal historic-economic category, to make the point that Jewry and Christendom had been homogenized in our huckster society.

There is a second example, mentioned earlier: the case of “Voltaire’s anti-Semitism”, as reported by Peter Gay. [[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n50) Voltaire’s derogatory remarks about the Jews, including the inevitable economic stereotype, are exhibited. But we are told in addition that Voltaire’s transgression is so much the less forgivable because the very same period held a live option for “philo-Semitism” which was taken by other men.

John Locke is cited as the philo-Semite, against Voltaire the anti- Semite. The evidence is Locke’s _Letter on Toleration_ (1689), where he indubitably comes out in favor of religious worship for Jews: “The Jews are permitted to have dwellings and private houses; why are they denied synogogues?” If Locke was also in favor of equal rights for Jews across the board, as Gay seems to imply, Locke neglected to say so in this essay. He goes so far as to state that “neither Pagan nor Mahometan nor Jew should be excluded from the commonwealth because of his religion.”

Gay did not mention, however, that in this very same passage Locke makes clear that _he_ considers Judaism to be “abominable”. [[51]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n51) This is said only in passing; but then the other statements are in passing too; for Locke’s essay is a closely reasoned argumentation, not a discursive article, and the reference to the Jews is a hurried one. We know of no reason to believe that Locke had any greater liking than Voltaire for the practitioners of this “abominable” cult: he was arguing in the spirit of the civil-liberties lawyer who battles for equal rights even for known criminals.

But was not Voltaire also for religious toleration in the same sense? Yes, he was; and in fact in 1764 a French translation of Locke’s essay was joined to Voltaire’s treatise on toleration to make one book, with a preface (which Professor Klibansky believes was written by Voltaire himself) praising Locke’s argument. [[52]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n52)

We can now see how to create (or appoint) philo-Semites and anti-Semites at will. Granted that both Locke and Voltaire were for toleration of the Jewish religion, and that both disliked the Jews themselves, you quote Locke on the first and Voltaire on the second – _voilà!_ The system is an infallible recipe. [[3*]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#nc)

There is a further complication about the “anti-Semite” Voltaire, which Gay does set forth. It seems, argues Gay, that in these excursions Voltaire was interested in striking not so much at Judaism as at Christianity, for he wanted to reinforce his hostile view of Christianity by also discrediting the source (Judaism) from which this pernicious religion derived. Hence his “dislike of the Jews ... was a partly unconscious, partly conscious cloak for his anti-Christian sentiments.” [[54]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n54) In fact, Voltaire was interested in attacking all religions from his Deist standpoint – just as, from the same Deist standpoint, Lessing wanted to represent all religions as equally meaningless as far as differences were concerned. Where Lessing portrayed the noble Jew, Moslem, and Christian with equable brush in a paroxysm of reconciliation, Voltaire painted all the devout as fools, knaves, and miscellaneous miscreants – also fairly impartially. In his century there was no reason to let the Jews off the hook; that makes him an “anti-Semite” in this century – for historians who project themselves back into history as undercover agents of the Anti-Defamation League.

Lastly: we mentioned earlier that the “Young Germany” movement (Gutzkow, Laube) has been cited for anti-Semitic treatment of Jewish figures – like everybody else. Gutzkow, for example, wrote a novel involving this sort of anti-Semitism. But when the young Engels, not yet nineteen, became enthusiastic about Young Germany’s liberal and democratic tendency, the figure he admired most was Ludwig Borne. Indeed his letters of this time to a boyhood friend are filled with encomiums on this German Jewish publicist. [[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n55) In this young man’s eyes, Young Germany stood not only for political freedom in general but in particular for Jewish emancipation – “Who can have anything against this?” [[4*]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#nd) For him, the “distress of the Jews” is part of the liberal indictment of the status quo. He tells his friend about his literary hero: You call for a faithful Eckart? “See, there he is already, a small chap with a sharp Jewish profile – his name is Borne ...” He mentions the liberal poet Creizenach twice with warm praise, and both times prominently identifies Creizenach as a Jew. He brings up the “Wandering Jew” (in German, the “Eternal Jew”) as one of the models for freedom of the spirit about which he dreams of writing a second _Faust_. He lists “the emancipation of the Israelites as the first of three positive achievements of Napoleon. [[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n57)

Is this young man a philo-Semite like Lessing? Yes, like Lessing: for, in this same correspondence with his friend, one also finds the routine use of the economic-Jew stereotype as a jibe, as also in later life. Quoted by itself, this would make him an anti-Semite – like all the other pixillated people.

The real issue of the time had nothing to do with the use of language about Judaism based on the universally accepted economic-Jew stereotype. The real Jewish question was: _For or against the political emancipation of the Jews? For or against equal rights for Jews?_

This was the Jewish question that Marx discussed, not the one that dominated the minds of a sick society a century later.

Among these he mentioned the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Lombards, and Normans, as well as the Jews, all of them operating in the “interstices” or “pores” of a society not itself based on commerce. [[40]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n40)

[2*.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#fb) This, in turn, divides into two subquestions: one’s opinion of the religion (Judaism) or of the people. The first problem was consciousness of the distinction. Marx had distinguished between the two with unusual clarity in his letter of 13 March 1843 (see p.111fn), in which he mentioned his repugnance to the religion as against supporting the demand for Jewish emancipation. It must be recalled that at this point Judaism meant mainly the orthodox faith as it had emerged from the Middle Ages; Reform Judaism had just taken shape but would not have determined the public discussion. The rise of Reform Judaism was itself a symptom of the widespread repugnance felt by those modernized Jews who were not willing to be hypocritically orthodox à la Rothschild.

[3*.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#fc) Gay does the same with Montesquieu, but with an open contradiction. He cites Montesquieu as his second example of philo-Semitism as against Voltaire, since Montesquieu deplored persecution of the Jews. But Gay also mentions, before closing the matter, that Montesquieu was so misguided as to note “the Jews’ affinity for commerce and banking”, and that he even wrote: “You ask me if there are Jews in France. Know that wherever there is money, there are Jews.” [[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/hal-draper/article.htm#n53) Everybody is pixillated.

Marx Myths and Legends. Humphrey McQueen

### Reading the “unreadable” Marx

Il n’y a pas belles pensées sans belles formes.  
Flaubert.

The first rule, indeed by itself virtually a sufficient condition for good style, is _to have something to say._  
Schopenhauer.

From 1850 until his death in 1880, the French novelist Gustave Flaubert compiled a “Dictionary of Received Ideas” as his catalogue of stupidities, inanities and misinformation. In this word association game, “Malthus” summoned up “infamous,” and “Louis XVI” evoked “unfortunate.”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n1) Were we to update Flaubert by including “Marx,” the gully-trap of clichés would be clogged with “discredited” and “unreadable.”

Other contributors to this collection will discount the “discredited” label. This article tackles the accusation that Marx is “unreadable.” The two charges are connected. The more that people fear that Marx is impenetrable, the harder it will be to convince them to recover his relevance.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n2)

The way to challenge the accusation that Marx is “unreadable” is to read him. From _The Communist Manifesto_, here is the paean to the bourgeoisie that Marx and Frederick Engels penned in 1848:

Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned ...[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n3)

To keep pace with this torrent of transformations, Marx and Engels abbreviated their phrasing. To sketch how this turmoil had come about, they continued to use parataxis:

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n4)

The second sentence is as breathtaking as the tumult it captures in its run of snapshots.

Even as we read the passage, it seems impossible that anyone could have condensed the expanse of capitalism across 500 years into a statement as exhilarating as it is exact.

Marx’s admiration for the historic achievement of the bourgeoisie as a class did not extend to their apologists. How he would have revelled in Flaubert’s “Dictionary"! Marx stretched language so far that, in 1860, he was probably the first person to use “Da-Da!” to voice his own detestation of what he called “twaddle.”[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n5) Challenged as to its propriety, Marx came back: “Da Da puzzles the Philistine and is comical ... It pleases me, and it fits my system of mockery and contempt.”[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n6)

Just as the assault on Feudalism had broken through the Scholastic mode of communication to allow Martin Luther to render the bible in vigorous, direct and metrical German, so did the bourgeois revolution propel the prose of Marx and Engels. To convey the eruption of economy into society, they had to fashion a syntax, a vocabulary and a repertoire of devices in tune with the acceleration of life. Marshall Berman reads _The Manifesto_ as a prose poem, as “the first great modernist work of art,” anteceding Baudelaire’s _Spleen_.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n7)

Engels had got there four years earlier when composing _The Condition of the Working Class_ _in England in 1844_. In the 1970s, that work attracted the literary critic Steven Marcus who knew of no contemporary summary of the industrial revolution “that is as succinct, as wide-ranging and as coherent.” Apart from Engels’s use of “vortex,” he made scant use of hyperbole because “the unprecedented magnitude of the event is its own intensifier.” Marcus placed Engels alongside Carlyle and Dickens as writers who “were performing one of their quintessential functions: they were taking dead writing and transforming it back into living writing. Or we can say that they were transforming information into a present history whose structure they were simultaneously inventing.”[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n8)

### _Eighteenth Brumaire_

Bourgeois ideologues proved less keen to entertain the prospect of perpetual upheaval, once the proletariat began to challenge the rule of capital from the 1820s. History, therefore, had to come to an end, as Marx observed in 1847.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n9) By contrast, his welcoming of the organised working class allowed him to treat the present as history.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n10) He delivered a notable example of this perspicacity in his account of the rise to power between 1848 and 1852 of the French emperor, Napoleon III. Marx’s _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte_, is extraordinary for making so elaborate and so penetrating an analysis on the run. The parts, like a Dickens novel, were planned as installments to a weekly paper. The result is much more than a model of political journalism. By keeping the struggles between and within classes front and central to his unravelling of events, Marx could “demonstrate how the class struggle in France created circumstances and relations that made it possible for a grotesque mediocrity to play a hero’s part.”[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n11)

The opening lines of _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ grace the _Oxford Dictionary of Quotations_:

Hegel remarks somewhere that all events and personages of great importance in world history occur so to speak twice. He has forgotten to add: the first time as tragedy, the other time as farce.

A few lines further on, Marx observes:

People make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please: they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living. And just when they seem engaged in revolutionising themselves and things, in creating something that has never yet existed, precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle cries and costumes in order to present the new scene of world history in this time-honoured disguise and borrowed language.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n12)

Marx rounds off the first section of _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ by dismissing Napoleon III as the farcically bad copy of his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte:

Finally, the scum of bourgeois society forms the _holy phalanx of order_ and the hero Crapulinski installs himself in the Tuilleries as the “_saviour of society_.”[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n13)

Here, Marx has turned to his favourite contemporary poet, Heinrich Heine, for the figure of Crapulinski.

These three extracts indicate something of the range in Marx’s style. The opening is aphoristic, memorable for its puncturing of grand narrative with humour. The insertion of “somewhere” is no lapse of memory, but a considered affront to his erstwhile colleagues among the Young Hegelians. The middle passage is as suggestive in imagery as it is rich in concepts, bringing to life the vital processes on which Marx is commenting. He strengthens his representation of history’s slide into farce by associating its actors with a the travesty of cross-dressing. Hegel saw in parody the means by which one age returned to its past in order to criticise it. Marx saw parody, according to Margaret Rose, as “accompanying discontinuity in history.”[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n14) Just as revolutions are ruptures in practice, so revolutionary writers need tropes that allow for disjunctures in thought. In the third extract, Marx turns to earthy language to put the pretender in his place;[[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n15) the see-sawing between scum and holiness, between crap and saviour, recalls the tumble from tragedy into farce.

Despite the care that Marx devoted to his prose, he never pursued style for style’s sake. For him, the form of his writing had to confirm its content and structure. _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ is a fabulous read because he made it an exemplar of historical materialism. And it is exemplary because Marx’s tone of voice is as dialectical as his assembling of evidence and his pattern of analysis.

The German social philosopher Theodor Adorno might have had _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ in mind in 1946 when he charged that

... the dialectic advances by way of extremes, driving thoughts with the utmost consequentiality to the point where they turn back on themselves, instead of qualifying them...

... limitation and reservation are no way to represent the dialectic...

If a dialectician, for example, marked the turning-point of his advancing ideas by starting with a “But” at each caesura, the literary scheme would give the lie to the unschematic intention of his thought.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n16)

For Marx, the dialectic had to be fleet-footed, or it ceased to be dialectical. Bertell Ollman writes of the “dance of the dialectic.”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n17) For the dialectician, there are no fixed categories, no external essences, no Ideal Forms. Everything, always and everywhere, is in a condition of becoming and passing away. The difficulties that this mobility presents to readers can be limited if an author makes our static medium convey the transitory.

The excitement in Marx’s manner of expression grows from his fulfilling of Schopenhauer’s contention that the “sufficient condition for good style, is _to have something to say_.”[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n18) Hence, the deepest pleasure from reading Marx flows from the substance and structure of his thinking. The French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss recalled that he “rarely broached a new sociological problem without first stimulating my thought by rereading a few pages of _The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte_ or the _Critique of Political Economy_.”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n19)

Two of the cerebral stimuli from _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ are the ground rules that Marx offered for intellectual history and for tracing the political formation of a class. He summarised his explorations of these issues in two key passages. The first establishes the starting place for the history of ideas:

Just as little must one imagine that the democratic representatives are indeed all shopkeepers or enthusiastic supporters of shop keepers. In their education and individual position they may be as far part from them as heaven from earth. What makes them representatives of the petty bourgeoisie is the fact that in their minds they do not get beyond the limits that the latter do not get beyond in life, that they are consequently driven, theoretically, to the same problems and solutions to which material interest and social position drive the latter in practice. This is, in general, the relationship between the _political_ and _literary_ _representatives_ of a class and the class they represent.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n20)

This explication of how ideas connect with social practices confirms the materialist credentials of the opening passages of _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ where metaphors haunt present actors.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n21)

As a materialist, Marx recognised that existence conditioned consciousness. Hence, class consciousness could not fall from the sky as a disembodied idea. As a dialectician, he knew also that existence was insufficient to generate self-consciousness. Marx drew on the experiences of the French peasantry to illustrate why class consciousness had to be the outcome of social practices through organisation:

Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient; it itself directly produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with society. A smallholding, a peasant and his family; alongside them another smallholding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these make up a village, and a few score of villages make up a department. In this way, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes.

The structure of this passage reproduces Marx’s case: phrases are accumulated into a statement that lacks a doing word, just as the “vast mass” of small-holders do not engage in “manifold relations with one another.” The next step takes in a larger social group and therefore requires an unbroken sentence. Finally, the commentary arrives at a metaphor apposite to farm life: the potato sack. As the class forms politically, Marx makes the units of his prose cohere:

In so far as millions of families live under economic conditions of existence that separate their mode of life, their interests and their culture from those of the other classes, and put them in hostile opposition to the latter, they form a class. In so far as there is merely a local interconnection among these small-holding peasants, and the identity of their interests begets no community, no national bond and no political organisation among them, they do not form a class.

Each sentence loops around alternative criteria for the forming of a class. Their juxtaposition gives way to a synthesis:

They are consequently incapable of enforcing their class interest in their own name, whether through a parliament or through a convention.

Marx can now distill the components of his case into eight words which continue the see-sawing: “They cannot represent themselves, they must be represented.” From this position, Marx strikes out to link the movement of class into class consciousness with the structure of the state:

Their representative must at the same time appear as their master, as an authority over them, as an unlimited governmental power which protects them against the other classes and sends them rain and sunshine from above. The political influence of the small-holding peasants, therefore, finds its final expression in the executive power subordinating society to itself.[[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n22)

The assertiveness of “therefore” underlines Marx’s introduction of authoritarianism. Nonetheless, he has just mocked the capacity of any government to control nature, and hence, presumably, its ability to stem the tide of class conflict. While acknowledging that the life circumstances among the small peasants have allowed “Crapulinski” to ascend to the throne, Marx hints that their unsatisfied needs will unseat him.

### _Aphorisms_

Another way to entice readers towards Marx has been to dangle some of the aphorisms at which he was a dazzler, as when he observes: “Hence money may be dirt, although dirt is not money.”[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n23) Of Proudhon, he quipped: “He wants to be the synthesis – he is a composite error.”[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n24) Marx also used aphorisms as exclamation marks at the end of an analysis, a kind of “Eureka!” The impact of “Circulation sweats money from every pore”[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n25) is convincing only if encountered as the outcome of his investigations into the metamorphosis of commodities. Torn from the page, it is mere assertion. “One capitalist always kills many”[[26]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n26) sounds more than a tocsin after Marx has explained the thrust of monopolising through the logic of competition.

The risk in parading Marx’s maxims is that his meaning is rendered obvious, that is to say, is misrepresented. Wrenched from its context, the bait can catch the opposite response to the one after which Marx had been angling. That outcome is true of a remark favoured by militants: “Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to _change_ it.”[[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n27) Marx never supposed that we could change the world without interpreting it, any more than he believed that we can interpret the world correctly without changing it.

Perhaps no quip from Marx is better known than his line that “Religion is the opium of the people.” Few assertions are more misunderstood. Placing that remark back in his 1844 _Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right_ will reveal its significance, and display far finer turns of phrase than is apparent from the fragment:

_Religious_ distress is at the same time an _expression_ of real distress and a _protest_ against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of spiritless conditions. It is the _opium_ of the people...

To abolish religion as the _illusory_ happiness of the people is to demand their _real_ happiness. The demand to give up illusions about the existing state of affairs is the _demand_ to give up a state of affairs which needs illusions.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n28)

Marx’s meaning, along with the rhythms in which he expressed it, is evident once the epigram is returned to its textual origin. That relocation refutes any supposition that he was spurning all varieties of religious experience. Rather, he anchored his empathy with those enduring immiseration in his materialist appreciation that incorrect ideas are more than the product of wrong thinking.

Marx’s choice and arrangement of words strengthened the persuasiveness of this perception. His first sentence pivots on a conflicted concept of religion. The next carries that dichotomy through three variations, threaded with sibilance. After their rising inflection, the notorious remark falls as a lamentation, not a rhetorical slap. The second paragraph repeats this pattern, its recapitulated “illusions” again leading to a consolation. The compassion in Marx’s comment is assured by the felicities in his prose.

### _Figures of speech_

As we have seen, wordplay is as much a part of Marx’s prose as the class struggle is pivotal to his picture of the world. The social philosopher Vilfredo Pareto worried that Marx’s words were like bats since one can see in them both birds and mice.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n29) One danger with this ambiguity is that his meaning can never be pinned down, and so his epigones can escape criticism by alleging that their prophet has been misunderstood – a variant of the irrefutability that upset Popper. This possibility is unavoidable in coping with contraries, and thus is a small price to pay for the depth of understanding that Marx was able to provide by his appreciation of the fluidity of nature and social relationships.

Alertness to three of Marx’s favourite literary devices, to wit, puns, paradoxes and irony, will help with a reading the first volume of _Capital_ by showing how wove his dialectical method into the texture of his writing. One should always read Marx with an ear tuned for words, phrases and whole passages “enclosed by intonational quotation marks,” or trailing implied question marks.[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n30)

Puns: To associate puns with the lowest form of wit is another possible entry in Flaubert’s dictionary. Marx used puns to bind concepts together, as in his specifying the feature of alienation under the rule of capital. He shows that alienation under capitalism is different from other kinds of estrangement because the wage-slave has sold his capacity to labour. In English, “alienate” means to sell and to make strange. In German, Marx makes play on the German “äusser” to convey that connection. [“_Aus_-” in German is the prefix for “out,” so that _ein Auslander_ is a foreigner.]

One can sympathise with anyone translating passages such as:

Was früher _Sichäußerlichsein_, reale Entäußerung des Menschen ist nur [nun], zur Tat der Entäußerung, zur Veräußerung geworden.

The Soviet edition rendered this rolling pun:

What was previously _being external to oneself_ – man’s actual externalization – has merely become the act of externalizing – the process of alienating.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n31)

The three different German words rooted on “äußer” have been given as cognates of “external.” _Veräußern_ can mean “to sell one’s honour.” That medieval concept invokes capitalist alienation where the labourer is separated from the honour that the craftsman once put into a product, and from the honour that he drew from its quality. In addition, the wage labourer has sold his human capacities, his honour.

To complain about this aspect of Marx’s style is like objecting to Shakespeare’s punning on “will” in Sonnets 135 and 136. As Fowler has it: “Puns are good, bad and indifferent, & only those who lack the wit to make them are unaware of the fact.”[[32]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n32)

Paradox: Marx combined punning with paradox: “Das seine Lebensäußerung seine Lebensentäußerung ist,” that is, “The manifestation of his life is the alienation of his life.”[[33]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n33) The paradox is a pauper’s straining after dialectics. Paradoxes abounded in the young Marx as one mark of his legacy from Idealism where words stood in for reality. For example, he concluded _The Introduction to the Contribution to Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Law_: “Philosophy cannot be made a reality without the abolition of the proletariat, the proletariat cannot be abolished without philosophy being made a reality.”[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n34) This phrase-mongering contrasts with a comparable point which Marx made four years later at the close of the _Manifesto_: “The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.” The bi-polar form of the paradox remains, but Marx is no longer conjuring with categories. Instead, he is calling for the “forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.”

Irony: Francis Wheen has discovered in Marx the Dean Swift of industrial capitalism. Marx and Swift share brilliance in irony, but they differ in tone because of opposed social outlooks. Irony in Swift is chilling. Marx’s can be red hot.

Swift’s “A Modest Proposal for preventing the Children of the Poor People in Ireland, from being a Burden to their Parents or Country; and for making them beneficial to the Publick” (1729) reasoned that those infants should be reared as food for the English landlords whose expropriation of field and farm was devouring the parents. “A Modest Proposal” was Swift’s attempt to persuade his own class to alter their ways. By contrast, Marx aimed his ironies at energising a revolution of the masses.

Irony helped Marx to reproduce his dialectical method, as it had for Hegel who saw irony as dialectical because it allowed for two meanings simultaneously.[[35]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n35) An ironic comment has a kernel of subversive intent inside the shell of innocent observation.

Like Hegel, Marx saw that irony operates outside the logic that something must be either “A” or “non-A.” Marx’s analysis of capital could not be contained in such mutual exclusivities. Capital is capital only when it is expanding. To expand, it has to be in motion, passing from its money form, through a stage of production, into a commodity form, and then back to the money form so that the process can start over on an enlarged scale. Money is a shape-shifter and a form-changer.[[36]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n36) Marx found an analogue in irony, which not every commentator gets.[[37]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n37)

Marx’s ironic voice might not have been innate, but he had made it his own before he composed _The_ _German Ideology_ of 1845, as this prefatory note demonstrates:

Once upon a time a valiant fellow had the idea that men were drowned in water only because they were possessed with the _idea of gravity_. If they were to get this notion out of their heads, say by avowing it to be a superstitious, a religious concept, they would be sublimely proof against any danger from water. His whole life long he fought against the illusion of gravity, of whose harmful consequences all statistics brought him new and manifold evidence.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n38)

Marx has emphasised the fallacy of Idealist philosophy by understatement, never stepping outside the voice of an objective observer to display his own point of view by inserting “foolish” in front of “fellow.” The reader is left to add that judgement.[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n39)

### _Capital_

Quoting from the most popular of Marx’s writings to show how far they are from being unreadable was easy. Does _Capital_ promise equal delights? Barriers exist between _Capital_ and a mass readership. First, there is its length, 800 pages in volume one alone, and another 2000 pages in the three volumes that he left partly completed.

Above all, the difficulty with _Capital_ is in the issues that Marx tackled. The dynamics of capital expansion will never be glimpsed by a Murdoch columnist fixated on Foxtel, or, for that matter, by a research assistant clipping the _Financial Times_ each morning. Marx wrote books. He did not spray bullets from a Microsoft power point. To approach his writings, you have to be a prose person, not a dot.point person.

Most sympathetic guides to _Capital_ warn the beginner away from beginning at the beginning.[[40]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n40) In those pages, Marx presented the results of twenty years research. He might have kept that material until the end, so that by the time we reached its intricacies we would have been drawn towards his conclusions and become familiar with his terms and cast of mind. Instead, he gave us the results first. They also set forth his method of analysis.

Marx acknowledged that “the method of analysis which I have employed ... makes the reading of the first chapters rather arduous.”[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n41) Their 100 pages cannot be recommended as in-flight entertainment. A clear head, a pen in hand, and the preparedness to read the material at least three times over several years are required to absorb all the secrets that Marx uncovers. As Marx knew from experience: “There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.”[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n42)

At the trial of the Knave of Hearts in _Alice_’s _Adventures in Wonderland_, the King of Hearts admonishes the White Rabbit: “Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.” In the case of _Capital_, it is perhaps more judicious to start at the end of volume one with the nine-page chapter on “The Modern Theory of Colonisation.” Australians are not the only people surprised that Marx wound up with the settlement of our continent. He tells a story about Edward Gibbon Wakefield who proposed a plan for Systematic Colonisation to compel workers to sell their labour power instead of setting up as farmers or tradespeople for themselves:

Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative – the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. A Mr Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of 50,000. This Mr Peel even had the foresight to bring besides 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once he arrived at his destination, “Mr Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.” Unhappy Mr Peel who provided for everything except the export of English relations of production to Swan River![[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n43)

Seven pages further, the final sentence establishes the true north of Marx’s life project. He is not concerned with Mr Wakefield, his schemes, or the emotional quotient of Mr Peel:

The only thing that interests us is the secret discovered in the New World by the Political Economy of the Old World, and proclaimed on the house-tops: that the capitalist mode of production and accumulation, and therefore capitalist private property, have for their fundamental condition the annihilation of self-earned private property: in other words, the expropriation of the labourer.[[44]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n44)

The germ of _Capital_’s 800 pages is in these sixty words. Almost every word that Marx wrote after 1842 was his contribution to the struggle to check exploitation and to end expropriation. Before reading any part of _Capital_, whether for the first or the umpteenth time, it is worth returning to these lines for orientation. Should you feel lost in the detail of factory laws, perplexed by the delineation of use, exchange and surplus values, or trip on the poetic allusions, remember that “class struggle” is an anchor against being blown off course.

### _Three hurdles_

Although the advice to postpone an encounter with the opening segment of _Capital_ is sensible, that engagement cannot be put off for ever by any serious students of capitalism. After passing so many warning signs, readers are in for a surprise at how smoothly those early pages seem. Marx’s prose is neither convoluted nor arcane. The sentences are not very long. The vocabulary is well within the range of the average reader. There is no algebra. A year-eight student could manage the sums.

Before attending to how Marx draws us towards his discoveries, three difficulties in reading _Capital_ should be mentioned. They are mathematics; Hegelian methods and language; and references to other literary works.

Mathematics: Many of the formulae in _Capital_ are not algebra. Instead, they abbreviate Marx’s description of the circuits of capital. The simplest of these notations is M-C-M+, where M is money capital, C is Commodities, and M+ is the expanded volume of money capital that results from the making and sale of commodities. Marx could have kept writing these terms out in words, but hoped that a shorthand version would be easier on his readers. One does not need to understand any kind of mathematics to follow his notation. It involves no calculation. The formulae are closer to equations in chemistry than in mathematics.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n45)

Hegel: In an 1873 re-issue of _Capital_, Marx acknowledged that, in 1867, he had “openly avowed” himself “the pupil” of Hegel at a time when professors in Germany were contemptuous of “that mighty thinker.” Flaubert’s “Dictionary of Received Opinion” would now place “impenetrable” after Hegel’s name, not without justification, though he could be witty, clear and pungent.[[Den dialektiske materialismes ABC-1721248246487.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n46) Ponderousness is one element in Hegel’s worst writing that Marx did not inherit. Indeed, when Marx admitted that he had, “here and there, in the chapter on the theory of value, coquetted with the modes of expression peculiar” to Hegel, the crucial word is “coquetted.” Even at his most Hegelian, Marx never lost his cutting edge, peppering his denunciations with raillery, lightening his expositions with caricature.

Literary allusions: The learning that Marx brought to his subject can be another toll-gate to entry. At the close of a discussion of commodities, he asked: “Who fails here to call to mind our good friend, Dogberry, who informs neighbour Seacoal, that, ‘To be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but reading and writing comes by Nature’.”[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n47) The question today is who will be familiar with Dogberry as a comic character from Shakespeare’s _Much Ado About Nothing_. Volume One of _Capital_ includes quotations from Balzac, Cervantes, Dante, Goethe, Homer and Sophocles, whom Marx gave in their original tongues. Shy references to a host of other poets, dramatists and novelists embellish his critique of political economy.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n48)

Marx studded his writings with a comparable density of allusions to the ideas and terminologies of philosophers, historians and political economists. For example, when he likened life under communism where everyone would be able “to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticize after dinner.”[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n49) In the first three activities, Marx was mocking Adam Smith and almost every vulgar economist for their “unimaginative fantasies.”[[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n50) The post-prandial critical criticising was another dig at the Holy Family of Young Hegelians. Cultural semi-literates who fail to recognise these sources do not hesitate to berate Marx for putting forward an insipid picture of comforts suiting a country gent, or Tolstoy.[[51]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n51)

Another joy in reading _Capital_ comes from discovering the treasures lurking in its footnotes which, as in Edward Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall of Roman Empire_, contain several of the work’s more memorable insights and striking formulations:

This much however, is clear, that the Middle Ages could not live on Catholicism, nor the ancient world on politics. On the contrary, it is the mode in which they gained a livelihood that explains why here politics, and there Catholicism, played the chief part. For the rest, it requires but a slight acquaintance with the history of the Roman republic, for example, to be aware that its secret history is the history of its landed property. And there is Don Quixote, who long ago paid the penalty for wrongly imagining that knight errantry was compatible with all economic forms of society.[[52]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n52)

This blast at the ludicrousness of idealist historiography is a marvel of concentrated thought, delivering more perception in its 80 words than 80 professors chorusing “discredited” at the mention of Marx’s name could come up with in a lifetime.

The greatest amazement from _Capital_ is how Marx could keep so many levels of investigation going at once. Symphonists can rarely develop more than two principal themes, no matter how many variations they then introduce. Charles Dickens in _Bleak House_ (1852) depicted the Court of Chancery’s generating multitudes of cases and devouring the lives of all who approach. Critics who disparage the novel’s spontaneous combustion scene fail to see that the energy of Dickens’s composition is of a piece with spontaneous combustion. How was it possible for him to keep all the themes, plots and sub-plots running without his brain catching fire? Marx’s portrayal of the expansion of capital matches _Bleak House_ in its encompassing of energies marshalled and of forces unleashed.

Marx and Dickens also shared a fury at the grinding down of human capacities, especially in children. Marx summarised official reports on the effects of 72-hour week on the culture of children, anyone of whom could have been the model for Smike from _Nicholas Nickleby_, or Jo in _Bleak House_. Questioned by the Employment Commissioners, the twelve-year old Jeremiah Haynes responded:

We have a king (told it is a Queen), they call her the Princess Alexandra, Told that she married the Queen’s son. The Queen’s son is the Princess Alexandra. A princess is a man.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n53)

Marx fills page after page with such evidence until he takes another swipe at hypocrisy:

Meanwhile, late by night perhaps, self-denying Mr Glass-Capital, primed with port-wine, reels out of his club homeward droning out idiotically, “Britons never, never shall be slaves!”[[54]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n54)

Marx will have none of Dickens’s paternalism. Repentance no more than abstinence will redeem Mr Glass-Capital. The ghost that is haunting his kind is not Christmas Past but the spectre of a communist future.

### _The secret novelty of_ Capital

To propose that _Capital_ can be read as a novel is not to imply that it is fictional, still less a faction. The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975) proposed that “the plurality of styles and levels” is “characteristic of the novel as a genre.” As a social investigator, Marx called on all manner of literary devices to convey the complexities that he traced through the social relationships of capitalism. By Bakhtin’s criterion, _Capital_ Volume One lives within the genre of novel.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n55)

Balzac hinted at a secret history of “a scandalous kind.”[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n56) For Marx, the secret history of the Roman Republic was in “landed property.” In capitalism, the secret rests in how the commodity form conceals “the expropriation of the labourers,” which is the condition for their ceaseless exploitation.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n57)

The plotline of _Capital_ confronts us with this secret history, and then conducts us through the evidence. The secret about the commodity form proves to be another multiplicity of secrets about money as another commodity; about money as the universal equivalent for every commodity; about human capacity as a commodity. Having established these premises, Marx can lead us to an indictment of a system of exploitation which presents itself as one of a fair exchange of equal values.

Marx wrote in the tradition of Realism, not of Naturalism. He compiled details about factory conditions to uncover the logic of the expansion of capital. Thus, although he accumulated evidence with the assiduousness of a miser hoarding brass farthings, he used those mites, as would a capitalist, to expand his intellectual store “by constantly throwing it afresh into circulation.”[[Deres Moral og Vores-1721249695853.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n58)

The protagonist for Marx is neither a Romantic champion such as Julian Sorel, a carpenter’s son, in Stendahl’s _Le Rouge et le Noir_ (1830), nor the master criminal Vautrin in Balzac. In _Capital_, the central figure is the aggregation of capital, a figure which is most truly itself when its individual personifications behave as the accumulation of dead labour. Here is Marx making those bones speak:

Thus, what I _am_ and _am capable_ of is by no means determined by my individuality. I _am_ ugly, but I can buy for myself the _most beautiful_ of women. Therefore I am not _ugly_, for the effect of ugliness – its deterrent power – is nullified by money. I, according to my individual characteristics, am _lame_, but money furnishes me with twenty-four feet. There I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and hence its possessor. Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good. Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest. I am _brainless_, but money is the _real brain_ of all things and how then should its possessor be brainless? Besides, he can buy clever people for himself, and is he who has power over the clever not more clever than the clever?[[59]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n59)

Marx has brought us close to the grotesqueries of Rabelais as capital reproduces Gargantua’s appetites. Capital is also like that giant when he pours salt into the mouths of sleepers to stimulate their thirst; the managers of capital have to inculcate desire for commodities of every kind:

He puts himself at the service of the other’s most depraved fancies, plays the pimp between him and his need, excites in him morbid appetites, lies in wait for each of his weaknesses – all so that he can then demand the cash for this service of love.[[60]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n60)

Gargantua and Pantagruel are flesh-and-blood creatures of a society dependent on the soil and hand labour. Capital must be depicted as a machine because the operations of its social world has become like the machines that accelerate its expansion. Leviathans become the apt image for the power of capital in Dickens’s Chancery Court or Circumlocution Office, Melville’s factory ship, Zola’s coal mine, Sinclair’s slaughterhouse and Ireland’s oil refinery.

The anti-heroes, and thus the true heroes of Marx’s _Capital_ are “the new fangled men” who are needed to master “the new-fangled forces of society.” They too have become machine-like. They are new-fangled because of their place in the productive order.[[61]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n61) If ordinary people enter European fiction as degraded,[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n62) Marx represents their misery as a pre-condition for their remaking themselves into a collective presence to take the place of Hegel’s world historical figures.

Marx did everything a writer could to clarify the complexities of capitalism without over-simplifying. He used homely examples of how linen becomes a coat, or of how linen is exchanged for a bible before the cash from that transaction is spent on brandy.[[63]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n63) His materialist approach to history as the activity of living people encouraged his dramatic flair. Although he presented capitalists as the personifications of capital, he knew that he had to treat these “actors ... as individuals.”[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n64) Hence, he told tales about “Mr Moneybags” or “Mr Glass-Capital.”

Marx’s core task was to explain the expansion of capital in the aggregate, what he called “social capital,” as distinct from individual capitals. The fun that he had with fables about Mr Moneybags ran second to the delight he took in mocking writers who represented capitalism from the standpoint of “our friend Robinson” Crusoe. Capitalists got workers to produce exchange values. Crusoe, the complete _homo faber_, made nothing but use values for himself. He has provided for himself before Friday arrives. That approach equated the operations of the capitalists’ system with its ideological mask as individualism.[[65]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n65) Capital, for Marx, was a social relationship before it was anything else. Marx created fables to convey actual relationships: the Robinsonards treated Defoe’s fiction as the model for reality. The real-life captains of industry were imprisoned in the iron cage of capital’s expansion, not marooned on an island.

No more than the meanest child labourer could escape from her travails by wishing herself into a Dickensian plot is the capitalist able to choose the circuits of capital around which he must chase a fortune:

If social capital experiences a revolution in value, it may happen that the capital of the individual capitalist succumbs to it and fails, because it cannot adapt itself to the conditions of this movement of values. The more acute and frequent such revolutions in value become, the more does the automatic movement of the now independent value operate with the elemental force of a natural process, against the foresight and calculation of the individual capitalist.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n66)

The excitement that Marx brings to his account of the accumulation of capital is possible because of the space he accepts between tendential laws and entrepreneurship, fate and risk-taking, or what he calls “a Faustian conflict between the passion for accumulation, and the desire for enjoyment.”[[Den kapitalistiske udviklingskurve-1721248671831.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n67) Marx used story-telling to illuminate this reality.

Polyvocalism: Bakhtin found “laughter” and “polyglossia” to be of “decisive importance” in making “possible the genre of the novel.”[[68]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n68) _Capital_ is heir to both qualities, contributing to their enrichment. The tonal range in the laughter has been indicated. Now it is time to illustrate how Marx creates dialogue to convince his audience that the story he is relating represents their actual conditions.

In a chapter examining the labour-process, Marx grappled with the puzzle at the center of the expansion of capital, and therefore the most difficult concept to explain. He had to get across how capitalists paid their workers the full value of their capacity to add value, while at same time paying those labourers less than the total value of the commodities they produced. Marx restated his case in the negative by falling into conversation with a capitalist “friend” who has failed to turn a profit. This unhappy fellow has been offered no more for the cotton that his operatives have spun than the fifteen shillings it cost him to have them produce it.

Unlike Mr Peel, this capitalist cannot lay the blame for his unhappiness on the absence of the capitalist relations of production. What has gone wrong? His failure to profit leaves him staring “in astonishment” before he gathers his knowledge of “vulgar economy” to exclaim:

“Oh, but I advanced my money for the express purpose of making more money.”

After the capitalist has entered his first plea, Marx has assumed the voice of a judge from on-high:

The way to Hell is paved with good intentions, and he might just as easily have intended to make money, without producing at all.

The loser now

threatens all sorts of things. He won’t be caught napping again. In future he will buy the commodities in the market, instead of manufacturing them himself.

We have heard from the capitalist again, but in the third person. Marx reappears to ask and state the obvious, also in the third person:

But if all his brother capitalists were to do the same, where would he find his commodities in the market? And his money he cannot eat.

Next, the capitalist “tries persuasion”:

“Consider my abstinence; I might have played ducks and drakes with the 15 shillings; but instead of that I consumed it productively, and made yarn with it.”

The capitalist has returned in his own colloquial voice. This time Marx addresses his remarks to some unseen third party:

Very well. And by way of reward he is now in possession of good yarn instead of a bad conscience; ... Let him therefore console himself with the reflection that virtue is its own reward.

This verdict is no comfort to the appellant, who “becomes importunate”:

He says: “The yarn is no use to me; I produced it for sale.”

Marx gives more unwelcome advice from the stance of a disinterested commentator:

In that case let him sell it, or still better, let him for the future produce only things for satisfying his personal wants ...

This interchange continues the switch between direct speech and commentary. The capitalist gets no more satisfaction from Dr Marx than he has from the market. Small wonder the capitalist “friend” now “gets obstinate,” flinging forth rhetorical questions:

“Can the labourer, merely with his arms and his legs, produce commodities out of nothing? Did I not supply him with the materials, by means of which, and in which alone, his labour could be embodied? And as the greater part of society consists of such ne’er do-wells, have I not rendered society incalculable service by my instruments of production, my cotton and my spindles, and not only society but the labourer also, whom in addition I have provided with the necessities of life? And am I to be allowed nothing in return for all this service?”

Where will this eloquence get him? Marx no longer speaks either to his “friend” or as a remote adjudicator, but to the reader of _Capital_:

Well, but has not the labourer rendered him the equivalent service of changing his cotton and spindle into yarn? ... The capitalist paid to the labourer a value of 3 shillings, and the labourer gave him back an exact equivalent in the value of 3 shillings, added by him to the cotton: he gave him value for value.

Marx has spoken as the author of _Capital_ rather than as the author of this fable within _Capital_.

Our friend, up to this time so purse-proud, suddenly assumed the modest demeanour of his own workman and exclaims: “Have I myself not worked? Have I not performed the labour of superintendence and of overlooking the spinner? And does this labour, too, create value?” His overlooker and his manager try to hide their smiles.

Marx assumes that readers who have reached this point in his analysis will realise that the tasks that the capitalist claims to have performed himself were done by his smirking employees. The smiles that Marx hopes that his fable will provoke in his readers are here brought to the surface by this silent chorus of overseers. Even without having read a line of _Capital_, those foremen know that their disciplining of labour time differs qualitatively from its application by labourers in the creation of additional values. By this stage, not even the capitalist can keep a straight face:

Meanwhile, after a hearty laugh, he re-assumed his usual mien.

Though he chanted to us the whole creed of the economists, in reality, he says, he would not give a brass farthing for it. He leaves this and all such like subterfuges and juggling tricks to the professors of Political Economy, who are paid for it.

Throughout, Marx has been using his “friend” to express his own scorn for those professors. Marx had reached that valuation from his critiquing of their “subterfuges and juggling tricks.” The capitalist, on the other hand, is sprouting what passes for common sense among his kind:

He himself is a practical man; and though he does not always consider what he says outside his business, yet in his business he knows what he is about.[[Deres Moral og Vores-1721249695853.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n69)

Marx leaves us with the capitalist at his own assessment. Marx knows otherwise. The anecdote would never have been possible had the capitalist known what he was about “in his business.” After all, he has failed to realise a profit.

The sole author of all these words has been Dr Marx. Yet, not all the views expressed are his.[[Den økonomiske konjunktur og den internationale arbejderbevægelse-1721249170794.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n70) The capitalist speaks in his own defence only to convict himself. His offence is not that he has exploited his workers, but that he has failed to do so.

Marx has subverted the Socratic dialogue by having his “friend” arrive at the truth about surplus value through rehearsing the conditions of his existence as a personification of capital. Instead of Marx’s presenting himself as a Socratic interlocutor, he confronts the capitalist with the steps that have led to his failure to profit.

The humour that Marx has built throughout the passage depends on the instability in the speaking positions of both Marx and his friend. Marx is, by turns, reporter, judge, and critic of political economy. The capitalist appears astonished, threatening, persuasive, importunate, obstinate, modest, laughing. Despite his dodges and masks, his performance has had but one theme. Unlike Shylock, he demands only “My ducats,” caring not for his daughter, justice, religion or the law.

Marx has reproduced in his analysis of capital, the Babel of voices in a stratified society. He has orchestrated the voices of his “friend,” but also interpreted them by putting his pleas for profit into their context of capitalist exploitation. Marx has not only put them into his friend’s mouth, but has made his version of the logic of capital accumulation speak through his creature. The ventriloquism is from off-stage, with both Marx and the capitalist taking turns as its mouthpieces.

Abstinence: One strand in the capitalist’s claim for a profit was “his abstinence.” This justification provided Marx with life-long opportunities for mocking the professorial subterfuge that profit is the reward that the capitalist earns for his not having spent his money on consumer goods:

It has never occurred to the vulgar economist to make the simple reflection, that every human action may be viewed, as “abstinence” from its opposite. Eating is abstinence from fasting, walking, abstinence from standing still, working, abstinence from idling, idling, abstinence from working, &c.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n71)

The unhappiness that the capitalist must undergo for the sake of “abstinence” becomes too much for Marx to bear:

The simple dictates of humanity therefore plainly enjoin the release of the capitalist from this martyrdom and temptation, in the same as that the Georgian slave-owner was lately delivered, by the abolition of slavery, from the painful dilemma, whether to squander the surplus-product, lashed out of his niggers, entirely in champagne, or whether to reconvert a part of it into more niggers and more land.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n72)

The more honest supporters of abstinence as a claim on profit had to admit that the children of these self-deniers had no right to inherit their fathers’ fortunes because the offspring had foregone none of the pleasures.[[73]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n73)

The Mirror Image: Because Marx recognised that capital is a social relationship, he sought images to convey that multi-sidedness. The mirror and reflection were two obvious tropes, yet too obvious to satisfy:

It is a sign of crudity and lack of comprehension that organically coherent factors are brought into haphazard relation with one another, i.e., into a simple reflex connection.[[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n74)

As we have seen, Marx extended his rejection of reflection to history. In _The Eighteenth Brumaire_, revolutionaries recognise themselves only after they have donned the “drag” to appear as some historical other. Similarly, he argued that petty-bourgeois thinkers do not reflect the thinking of shop-keepers. Their relationship is the active one of the intellectuals’ not proceeding in their theoretical practices further than the shopkeepers do in business.

Yet the mirror could be a more acceptable figure of speech if used as a simile rather than a metaphor:

Money ... reads all prices backwards, and thus _as it were_ mirrors itself in the bodies of all other commodities (Emphasis added.)[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n75)

The distancing that Marx has achieved here by the use of the conditional will not serve in all cases. A looking glass cannot convey human behaviour as the “real, sensuous activity” that Marx took as the root of his materialist dialectics:

The chief defect of all previous materialism ... is that things, reality, sensuousness are conceived only in the form of the object, or of contemplation, but not as _sensuous human activity, practice_, not subjectively.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n76)

Marx needed an active processing agent for his imagery. Here, the Soviet translation came closer: “Money ... depicts itself,” rather than “mirrors itself.”

Better still, the eye let Marx represent the active aspect of the relationships between people and objects. The eye was available as the apposite figure of speech only because of what had happened with the actual eye in history:

The eye has become a _human_ eye, just as its _object_ has become a social, _human_ object – an object made by man for man.[[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n77)

Under capitalism, the use value of the eye undergoes a transformation parallel to that experienced by all the objects created by humankind. While use values are becoming exchange values, the eye is being re-made into the sense mechanism that most stimulates desire for them.

The crucial case, and the hardest to represent, is that of the commodity form, the workings of which the untutored eye cannot discern:

From the mere look of a piece of money, we cannot tell what breed of commodity has been transformed into it. In their money-form all commodities look alike.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n78)

Marx infuses this conceptual connection between commodities and money into an evocation of urban energy of which Balzac or Dickens would have been proud:

The busiest streets of London are crowded with shops whose show cases display all the riches of the world, Indian shawls, American revolvers, Chinese porcelain, Parisian corsets, furs from Russia and species from the tropics, but all of these worldly things bear odious, white paper labels with Arabic numerals and then laconic symbols £. s. d. This is how commodities are presented in circulation.[[Den økonomiske konjunktur og den internationale arbejderbevægelse-1721249170794.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n79)

From this description, Marx moves to a sensuous image in which “the prices” become the “wooing glances cast at money by commodities.”[[80]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n80)

Commodities create a mirror-effect when their differences, real or apparent, are perceived by potential consumers. The contrast between a castle and the adjoining cottage becomes a source of desire for a bigger house:

A house may be large or small; as long as the surrounding houses are equally small it satisfies all social demands for a dwelling. But let a palace arise beside the little house, and it shrinks from a little house to a hut. The little house shows now that its owner has only very slight or no demands to make; and however high it may shoot up in the course of civilization, if the neighbouring palace grows to an equal or even greater extend, the occupant of the relatively small house will feel more an more uncomfortable, dissatisfied and cramped within its four walls.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n81)

The contrasts are reflected through the eye, that is to say, received into the brain. By exciting consumption, the eye holds a mirror to the production-consumption of commodities.

To learn to expand one’s needs through the perception of contrasts in the use values we already possess did not come into the world with capitalism. Rather, the proliferation of use values into ever more exchange values was able to build on a process at the heart of hominisation:

In a certain sense, a man is in the same situation as a commodity. As he neither enters into the world in possession of a mirror ... a man first sees and recognises himself in another man. Peter only relates to himself as a man through his relation to another man, Paul, in whom he recognises his likeness. With this, however, Paul also becomes from head to toe, in his physical form as Paul, the form of appearance of the species man for Peter.[[Den dialektiske materialismes ABC-1721248246487.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n82)

The mirror-phase is limited neither to infancy nor to the origins of our species, but acquired a vast domain with the spread of capitalist relations.

Neither money nor commodities is alive. Yet, it is integral to Marx’s picture of the capitalist world that they appear to be so. A carpenter fashions wood into a table. As soon as he offers this everyday thing for sale, “it steps forth as a commodity, [and] is changed into something transcendent.” Marx has to explain how a physical object acquires the imperceptible qualities of the social relationship between capital and wage-labour. He again turns to the experience of sight:

... light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve, but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself. But, in the act of seeing, there is at all events, an actual passage of light from one thing to another, from the external object to the eye. There is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities. There, the existence of the things qua commodities, and the value-relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connexion with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom. There is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things.[[Den kapitalistiske udviklingskurve-1721248671831.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/humphrey-mcqueen/article.htm#n83)

The fetishism of commodities is the knot that must be untied to unravel the secret of the expansion of capital, and hence to follow its exposition through the plot of _Capital_.

### _Conclusion_

Most socialists have not been Marxists, or aspired to be. It is lunacy of a high order to insist that the only people who will be allowed to participate in the overthrow of capitalism are those who subscribe to this or that version of the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. It is no less true that no one can remain a Marxist without being a socialist. Before Marxism is anything, it is a critique of capitalism. There can be no Marx for the master class. No one who has made peace with that regime of exploitation can use the methods, insights or rhetoric developed by Marx and Engels, not even to explain the longevity of the system that they spent their lives interpreting, in various ways, in order to hasten its end.

As a materialist, Marx had no time for those who approached his writings as sacred texts. As a revolutionary, he would never have judged our understanding of him by our ability to retrieve what he had intended, like some Medieval Schoolman From the standpoints of revolutionary politics and materialist historiography, his test would be whether what he had written conforms to the realities of capitalist development, or to the experiences that socialists had acquired about how to overthrow the state. Only by grappling with those practical ideas can we begin the even more taxing effort needed to create a socialist society.

21. This interplay of thinking with doing explains how those children of the bourgeoisie, Marx and Engels, could become proletarian intellectuals. Their case was less remarkable than that of Honore de Balzac (1799-1850), whose sequence of novels, The Human Comedy, Engels described as “a constant elegy to the irretrievable decay of good society; his sympathies are all with the class doomed to extinction.” Yet, as Engels went on to explain, he and Marx admired Balzac above all other contemporary novelists:

his satire is never keener, his irony never more bitter, than when he sets in motion the very men and women with whom he sympathises most deeply – the nobles ... That Balzac thus was compelled to go against his own class sympathies and political prejudices, that he saw the necessity of the downfall of his favourite nobles, and described them as people deserving no better fate ... that I consider one of the greatest triumphs of Realism.

Our appreciation of the complexity of Marx’s comment on religion will be deepened by adding knowledge of medical practices from around 1840 when opiates were not taken merely to put their users to sleep, but to deaden the pain, physical and psychological. Opiates allowed workers to continue their battles for existence, offering comfort, not oblivion, sustenance not slumber. It was in this ambivalent sense that Marx referred to religion as an opiate. An appreciation of the history of pharmacy is but one example of the care that must be exercised when interpreting any text.

A similar point can be made about Nietzsche’s “God is Dead.” The messenger is a madman who at once adds that he has arrived too soon. Anyway, the shocking aspect of his annunciation is not that God is dead, because the death and rebirth of gods are integral to religious thinking, including Christianity. The horror was the subsequent claim that “God remains dead,” leaving humanity without the promise of resurrection, see The Gay Science, New York, Vintage, 1974, p. 181.

Because Nelson is deaf to dialectics, she complains that Marx does not have a concept of money but rather a “theory of the money commodity.” She divides her time between nit-picking and thinking up Marx’s motives. (pp. 92-93). The intentionalist fallacy encouraged her to suppose that she can see into Marx’s thinking, which is the more risible given that she neither gets his jokes, nor is aware that he is being ironical. Her literalism is of a piece with her insensitivity to process. For an astute reading of Marx on money see Suzanne de Brunhoff, Urizen Books, New York, 1976.

39. Notwithstanding this restraint, Marx was not afraid to be robust, as in this sardonic onslaught:

Switzerland is the center of attraction for hysterical virgins over thirty, for the pale buds of the finishing school who are keen on the chaste by so effective love-making of the fleet hunters of the Chamois. In the original agricultural cantons the people live like animals, and are as bovine as their oxen. It is necessary, very necessary, that this last refuge of brutal primitive Germanism, of barbarians of bigotry, of patriarchal naiveté and purity of morals, of agricultural stability and of loyalty to death – available to the highest bidder – should at last be destroyed.

This “birthplace of freedom” is nothing else but the center of barbarism, of brutality, bigotry, hypocritical “purity” ... Internal affairs are exhausted in making cheese, chastity, and yodeling ... abroad, the only claim of the Swiss is that of being hired mercenaries.

Here, the rolling thunder comes with its flashes of ridicule. To strike at his target of hypocrisy, Marx reaches for the directness and rhythms of Luther’s bible. This barrage could be Luther’s excoriating the Papacy.

40. The French Marxist Louis Althusser was but one in a line of commentators to warn those opening _Capital_ to skip those 100 pages, that is, Part I on “Commodities and Money,” until after they had read the next 600. He further advised them to delay reading the 30 pages of Part V, see Louis Althusser, _Lenin and Philosophy_, NLB, London, 1971, pp. 79-86.

Many of us have been comforted to learn from Engels that Marx, although adept at algebra, including differential calculus “did not get the knack of handling figures, particularly commercial arithmetic.” Marx kept notebooks on differential calculus. The notion of approaching a result by ever smaller increments without ever reaching that end, that is, asymptotically, appealed to Marx as a means to express the dialectic, the process of change, see Mathematics Manuscripts of Karl Marx, New Park, London, 1983.

46. To dispel the lopsidedness of that judgement, let Hegel also speak in his own defence. Just before the end of his life in 1831, he responded to the debates leading up to the First Reform Bill in the British parliament: “Nowhere more than in England is the prejudice so fixed and so naïve that if birth and wealth give a man office they also give him brains.” “The English Reform Bill,” T.

The Soviet editions did not provide translations, though the Penguin series does. Working one’s way through the explanatory footnotes is a short course in cultural literacy. Marx advised one militant to learn Spanish, as he had done, by reading Don Quixote. The Moscow editions provided much of the necessary detail, culminating in the Marx-Engels Collected Works from 1975. Dirk Struik’s editing of the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ and _The Communist Manifesto_ was exemplary for his commentaries and scholarly apparatuses. The Penguin-New Left Editions from the 1970s also deserve to be consulted, both for their translations and their explanatory notes, which supply translations for Marx’s quotations.

The Penguin editor, Ben Fowkes, missed this jibe at Richard Wagner’s 1849 manifesto, “The Art-Work of the Future”: “Nobody – not even a practitioner of Zukunftsmusik* – can live on the products of the future ....” The asterisked footnote misinterprets Zukunftsmusik as “castles in the air, or dreams which may or may not be realized,” p. 272; The Moscow edition, _Capital_, p. 169, made no attempt to explain this rare reference to music in Marx, which he repeated in Volume II, Moscow, p. 493.

#### I

The concept of fetishism implies a negative concept of science. If relations between people exist as relations between things, then the attempt to understand social relations can proceed only negatively, by going against and beyond the form in which social relations appear (and really exist). Science is critical.

The concept of fetishism implies, therefore, that there is a radical distinction between ‘bourgeois’ science and critical or revolutionary science. The former assumes the permanence of capitalist social relations and takes identity for granted, treating contradiction as a mark of logical inconsistency. Science, in this view, is the attempt to understand reality. In the latter case, science can only be negative, a critique of the untruth of existing reality. The aim is not to understand reality, but to understand (and, by understanding, to intensify) its contradictions as part of the struggle to change the world. The more all-pervasive we understand reification to be, the more absolutely negative science becomes. If _everything_ is permeated by reification, then absolutely everything is a site of struggle between the imposition of the rupture of doing and the critical-practical struggle for the recuperation of doing. No category is neutral.

For Marx, science is negative. The truth of science is the negation of the untruth of false appearances. In the post-Marx Marxist tradition, however, the concept of science is turned from a negative into a positive concept. The category of fetishism, so central for Marx, is almost entirely forgotten by the mainstream Marxist tradition. From being the struggle against the untruth of fetishism, science comes to be understood as knowledge of reality. With the positivisation of science, power-over penetrates into revolutionary theory and undermines it far more effectively than any government undercover agents infiltrating a revolutionary organisation.

#### II

It is convenient to see the positivisation of science as being Engels’ contribution to the Marxist tradition, although there are certainly dangers in over-emphasising the difference between Marx and Engels: the attempt to put all the blame on to Engels diverts attention from the contradictions that were undoubtedly present in Marx’s own work.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n1)

The classic claim for the scientific character of Marxism in the mainstream tradition is Engels’ pamphlet, _Socialism, Utopian and Scientific_, which probably did more than any other work to define ‘Marxism’. Criticism of scientificism in the Marxist tradition often takes the form of a critique of Engels, but, in fact, the ‘scientific’ tradition is far more deep-rooted than that would suggest. It certainly finds expression in some of Marx’s own writings (most famously in the ‘1859 Preface’ to his _Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_), and is developed in the ‘classical’ era of Marxism by writers as diverse as Kautsky, Lenin, Luxemburg and Pannekoek. Although Engels’ writings possibly have relatively few explicit defenders today, the tradition which Engels represents continues to provide the unspoken and unquestioned assumptions upon which a great deal of Marxist discussion is based. In what follows, our principal concern is not who said what, but to draw out the main constituents of the scientific tradition.

In speaking of Marxism as ‘scientific’, Engels means that it is based on an understanding of social development that is just as exact as the scientific understanding of natural development. The course of both natural and human development is characterised by the same constant movement: ‘When we consider and reflect upon Nature at large or the history of mankind or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of an endless entanglement of relations and reactions, permutations and combinations, in which nothing remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes away.... This primitive, naïve but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus: everything is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away.’ (1968, p. 43)

Dialectics is the conceptualisation of nature and society as being in constant movement: it ‘comprehends things and their representations, ideas, in their essential connection, concatenation, motion, origin, and ending... Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasing daily, and thus has shown that, in the last resort, Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically.’ (1968, p. 45) Through dialectics we can reach an exact understanding of natural and social development: ‘An exact representation of the universe, of its evolution, of the development of mankind, and of the reflection of this evolution in the minds of men, can therefore only be obtained by the methods of dialectics with its constant regard to the innumerable actions and reactions of life and death, of progressive and retrogressive changes.’ (1968, p. 46) For Engels, dialectics comprehends the objective movement of nature and society, a movement independent of the subject.

The task of science, then, is to understand the laws of motion of both nature and society. Modern materialism, unlike the mechanical materialism of the eighteenth century, is dialectical: ‘modern materialism sees in [history] the process of evolution of humanity and aims at discovering the laws thereof... Modern materialism embraces the more recent discoveries of natural science, according to which Nature also has its history in time, the celestial bodies, like the organic species that, under favourable conditions, people them, being born and perishing... In both aspects, modern materialism is essentially dialectic...’ (1968, pp. 47-48)

It need hardly be underlined that Engels’ understanding of the dialectic method is an extremely diluted one. Lukács brought upon himself the wrath of the Party by pointing this out in _History and Class Consciousness_: ‘Dialectics, he [Engels] argues, is a continuous process of transition from one definition into the other. In consequence a one-sided and rigid causality must be replaced by interaction. But he does not even mention the most vital interaction, namely the _dialectical relation between subject and object in the historical process_, let alone give it the prominence it deserves. Yet without this factor dialectics ceases to be revolutionary, despite attempts (illusory in the last analysis) to retain ‘fluid’ concepts. For it implies a failure to recognise that in all metaphysics the object remains untouched and unaltered so that thought remains contemplative and fails to become practical; while for the dialectical method the central problem is _to change reality_.'(Lukács 1971, 3) Dialectics, for Engels, becomes a natural law, not the reason of revolt, not the ‘consistent sense of non-identity’, the sense of the explosive force of the denied. It is no doubt for this reason that some authors, in their criticism of the orthodox Marxist tradition, have been concerned to criticise the whole idea of a dialectical method.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n2)

For Engels, the claim that Marxism is scientific is a claim that it has understood the laws of motion of society. This understanding is based on two key elements: ‘These two great discoveries, the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value, we owe to Marx. With these two discoveries Socialism becomes a science. The next thing was to work out all its details and relations.’ (1968, p. 50)

Science, in the Engelsian tradition which became known as ‘Marxism’, is understood as the exclusion of subjectivity: ‘scientific’ is identified with ‘objective’. The claim that Marxism is scientific is taken to mean that subjective struggle (the struggle of socialists today) finds support in the objective movement of history. The analogy with natural science is important not because of the conception of nature that underlies it but because of what it says about the movement of human history. Both nature and history are seen as being governed by forces ‘independent of men’s will’, forces that can therefore be studied objectively.

The notion of Marxism as scientific socialism has two aspects. In Engels’ account there is a double objectivity. Marxism is objective, certain, ‘scientific’ knowledge of an objective, inevitable process. Marxism is understood as scientific in the sense that it has understood correctly the laws of motion of a historical process taking place independently of men’s will. All that is left for Marxists to do is to fill in the details, to apply the scientific understanding of history.

The attraction of the conception of Marxism as a scientifically objective theory of revolution for those who were dedicating their lives to struggle against capitalism is obvious. It provided not just a coherent conception of historical movement, but also enormous moral support: whatever reverses might be suffered, history was on our side. The enormous force of the Engelsian conception and the importance of its role in the struggles of that time should not be overlooked. At the same time, however, both aspects of the concept of scientific socialism (objective knowledge, objective process) pose enormous problems for the development of Marxism as a theory of struggle.

If Marxism is understood as the correct, objective, scientific knowledge of history, then this begs the question, ‘who says so?’ Who holds the correct knowledge and how did they gain that knowledge? Who is the subject of the knowledge? The notion of Marxism as ‘science’ implies a distinction between those who know and those who do not know, a distinction between those who have true consciousness and those who have false consciousness.

This distinction immediately poses both epistemological and organisational problems. Political debate becomes focussed on the question of ‘correctness’ and the ‘correct line’. But how do we know (and how do they know) that the knowledge of ‘those who know’ is correct? How can the knowers (party, intellectuals or whatever) be said to have transcended the conditions of their social time and place in such a way as to have gained a privileged knowledge of historical movement? Perhaps even more important politically: if a distinction is to be made between those who know and those who do not, and if understanding or knowledge is seen as important in guiding the political struggle, then what is to be the organisational relation between the knowers and the others (the masses)? Are those in the know to lead and educate the masses (as in the concept of the vanguard party) or is a communist revolution necessarily the work of the masses themselves (as ‘left communists’ such as Pannekoek maintained)? .

The other wing of the concept of scientific Marxism, the notion that society develops according to objective laws, also poses obvious problems for a theory of struggle. If there is an objective movement of history which is independent of human volition, then what is the role of struggle? Are those who struggle simply carrying out a human destiny which they do not control? Or is struggle important simply in the interstices of the objective movements, filling in the smaller or larger gaps left open by the clash of forces and relations of production? The notion of objective laws opens up a separation between structure and struggle. Whereas the notion of fetishism suggests that _everything_ is struggle, that nothing exists separately from the antagonism of social relations, the notion of ‘objective laws’ suggests a duality between an objective structural movement of history independent of people’s will, on the one hand, and the subjective struggles for a better world, on the other. Engels’ conception tells us that the two movements coincide, that the former gives support to the latter, but they do not cease to be separate. This duality is the source of endless theoretical and political problems in the Marxist tradition.

Engels’ notion of the objective movement of history towards an end gives a secondary role to struggle. Whether struggle is simply seen as supporting the movement of history or whether it is attributed a more active role, its significance in any case derives from its relation to the working out of the objective laws. Whatever the differences in emphasis, struggle in this perspective cannot be seen as self-emancipatory: it acquires significance only in relation to the realisation of the goal. The whole concept of struggle is then instrumental: it is a struggle to achieve an end, to arrive somewhere. The positivisation of the concept of science implies a positivisation of the concept of struggle. Struggle, from being struggle-against, is metamorphosed into being struggle-for. Struggle-for is struggle to create a communist society, but in the instrumentalist perspective which the positive-scientific approach implies, struggle comes to be conceived in a step-by-step manner, with the ‘conquest of power’ being seen as the decisive step, the fulcrum of revolution. The notion of the ‘conquest of power’, then, far from being a particular aim that stands on its own, is at the centre of a whole approach to theory and struggle.

#### III

The implication of Engels’ analysis, namely that the transition to communism would come about inevitably as a result of the conflict between the development of the forces of production and the relations of production, did not satisfy the revolutionary theorists-activists of the early part of the century. They insisted on the importance of active struggle for communism, yet they retained much of the dualism of Engels’ presentation of ‘Marxism’.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n3)

The problems posed by the dualistic separation of subject and object came to the fore in the revolutionary turbulence of the beginning of this century. Virtually all the debates of the ‘classical’ period of Marxism (roughly the first quarter of the twentieth century) took place on the assumed foundation of the ‘scientific’ interpretation of Marxism. Despite their very important political and theoretical differences, all the major theorists of the period shared certain common assumptions about the meaning of Marxism — assumptions associated with key words such as ‘historical materialism’, ‘scientific socialism’, ‘objective laws’, ‘Marxist economics’.

This is not to say that there was no theoretical development. Perhaps most important, attention in this period of upheaval came to focus on the importance of subjective action. Against the quietistic, wait-and-see interpretations of historic necessity favoured by the main body of the Second International, all the revolutionary theorists of the period (Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky, Pannekoek and so on) stressed the need for active revolutionary intervention. But this emphasis on the subjective was seen in all cases as complementary to (if not subordinate to) the objective movement of capitalism. Now that the theoretical criticism of Engels as the ‘distorter’ of Marx has gained such wide diffusion, it should be emphasised that the assumptions of scientific Marxism were accepted not only by the reformists of the Second International but by most if not all the major revolutionary theorists.

The dualist concept of Marxism as science has, it was seen, two axes: the notion of an objective historical process and the notion of objective knowledge. The theoretical-political problems connected with both of these axes provided the stuff of theoretical debate in this period.

The first of these axes, the concept of history as an objective process independent of human will was the main issue in Rosa Luxemburg’s classic defence of Marxism against the revisionism of Bernstein, in her pamphlet, _Reform or Revolution_, first published in 1900. Luxemburg’s pamphlet is above all a defence of scientific socialism. For her, the understanding of socialism as objective historic necessity was of central importance to the revolutionary movement: ‘The greatest conquest of the developing proletarian movement has been the discovery of grounds of support for the realisation of socialism in the economic condition of capitalist society. As a result of this discovery, socialism was changed from an ‘ideal’ dream by humanity for thousands of years to a thing of historic necessity’ (1973, p. 35).

Echoing the distinction made by Engels between scientific and utopian socialism, Luxemburg sees the notion of economic or historic necessity as essential if the emptiness of endless calls for justice is to be avoided. Criticising Bernstein, she writes: ‘"Why represent socialism as the consequence of economic compulsion?” he complains. “Why degrade man’s understanding, his feeling for justice, his will?” (_Vorwärts_, March 26th, 1899) Bernstein’s superlatively just distribution is to be attained thanks to man’s free will, man’s will acting not because of economic necessity, since this will itself is only an instrument, but because of man’s comprehension of justice, because of man’s _idea of justice_. We thus quite happily return to the principle of justice, to the old war horse on which the reformers of the earth have rocked for ages, for the lack of surer means of historic transportation. We return to that lamentable Rosinante on which the Don Quixotes of history have galloped towards the great reform of the earth, always to come home with their eyes blackened.’ (1973, pp. 44-45)

The scientific character of Marxism is thus seen as its defining feature. The scientific basis of socialism is said to rest ‘on three principal results of capitalist development. First, on the growing anarchy of capitalist economy, leading inevitably to its ruin. Second, on the progressive socialisation of the process of production, which creates the germs of the future social order. And third, on the increased organisation and consciousness of the proletarian class, which constitutes the active factor in the coming revolution’ (1973, p. 11).

The third element, the ‘active factor’, is important for Luxemburg: ‘It is not true that socialism will arise automatically from the daily struggle of the working class. Socialism will be the consequence of (1) the growing contradictions of capitalist economy and (2) the comprehension by the working class of the unavoidability of the suppression of these contradictions through a social transformation’ (1973, p. 31). Thus, although Luxemburg, in common with all the revolutionary theorists, rejects the quietistic interpretation of the inevitability of socialism favoured by many in the German Social Democratic party, the emphasis on the importance of subjective action is located against the background of the objective, historic necessity of socialism. Socialism will be the consequence of (1) objective trends, and (2) subjective comprehension and practice. The focus on the subjective is added to the understanding of Marxism as a theory of the historic necessity of socialism; or, perhaps more precisely, Marxism, as a theory of objective necessity complements and fortifies subjective class struggle. Whichever way around it is put, there is the same dualist separation between the objective and the subjective — ‘the classic dualism of economic law and subjective factor’. (Marramao 1978, p. 29)

The central issue arising from this dualism was the question of the relation between the two poles of the dualism — between historic necessity and the ‘active factor’. The terms of the question posed by scientific socialism already suggest an endless debate between determinism and voluntarism, between those who attribute little importance to subjective intervention and those who see it as crucial. The argument, however, is about the space to be granted to the subject within an objectively determined framework. The space is essentially intersticial, the argument being over the nature of the interstices.

Whatever the weight attached to the ‘active factor’, the argument is about how to reach the objectively determined ‘final goal’. Luxemburg opens her argument against Bernstein in _Reform or Revolution_ by accusing him of abandoning the ‘final goal’ of the socialist movement. She quotes him as saying ‘The final goal, no matter what it is, is nothing; the movement is everything.’ (1973, p. 8) To this Luxemburg objects: ‘the final goal of socialism constitutes the only decisive factor distinguishing the social democratic movement from bourgeois democracy and from bourgeois radicalism, the only factor transforming the entire labour movement from a vain effort to repair the capitalist order into a class struggle against this order, for the suppression of this order...’ (1973, p. 8) And what is this final goal, according to Luxemburg? ‘The conquest of political power and the suppression of wage labour’. (1973, p. 8)

The goal, then, according to Luxemburg, is to bring about social revolution through the conquest of political power. ‘From the first appearance of class societies having the class struggle as the essential content of their history, the conquest of political power has been the aim of all rising classes.’ (1973, p. 49) ‘It is necessary to extract the kernel of socialist society from its capitalist shell. Exactly for this reason must the proletariat seize political power and suppress completely the capitalist system.’ (1973, p. 52) Class struggle is instrumental, the aim being ‘to extract the kernel of socialist society from its capitalist shell’. Struggle is not a process of self-emancipation which would create a socialist society (whatever that might turn out to be) but just the opposite: struggle is an instrument to achieve a preconceived end which would then provide freedom for all.

In the classical debates of Marxism, the issue of the relation between the ‘active factor’ and ‘historic necessity’ was focused most clearly in the discussions surrounding the collapse of capitalism. These discussions had important political implications since they centred on the transition from capitalism to socialism, and therefore on revolution and revolutionary organisation (although the different positions did not follow any simple left-right split (cf Marramao 1978)).

At one extreme was the position usually identified with the Second International, and formulated most clearly by Cunow at the end of the 1890s (Cunow 1898-99): since the collapse of capitalism was the inevitable result of the working out of its own contradictions, there was no need for revolutionary organisation. Those who argued that the collapse of capitalism was inevitable did not all draw the same conclusions, however. For Luxemburg, as we have seen, the inevitable collapse of capitalism (which she attributed to the exhaustion of the possibilities of capitalist expansion into a non-capitalist world) was seen as giving support to anti-capitalist struggle rather than detracting from the need for revolutionary organisation.

The opposite view, the view that collapse was not inevitable, also led to diverse political conclusions. For some (Bernstein, for example) it led to the abandonment of a revolutionary perspective and the acceptance of capitalism as a framework within which social improvements could be sought. For others, such as Pannekoek, the rejection of the idea of the inevitability of capitalist collapse was part of an emphasis on the importance of revolutionary organisation: he argued that the objective movement of capitalist contradictions would lead not to collapse, but to ever more intense crises, which must be understood as opportunities for subjective action to overthrow capitalism (1977). It is interesting that Pannekoek, the leading theorist of left or council communism, denounced by Lenin in his _Left-Wing Communism — An Infantile Disorder_, accepted, in spite of all his emphasis on the importance of developing the ‘active side’, the framework of Marx’s ‘economic materialism’ as the analysis of the objective movement of capitalism. His emphasis on activism did not take the form of challenging the objectivist interpretation of Marx, but of arguing that it was necessary to complement the objective development by subjective action.

The second axis of scientific Marxism, the question of scientific knowledge and its organisational implications, formed the core of the discussion between Lenin and his critics.

In Lenin’s theory of the vanguard party, the organisational implications of the positive notion of scientific knowledge are developed to the point of creating a sharp organisational distinction between the knowers (those who have true consciousness) and the non-knowers (the masses who have false consciousness). In the pamphlet which spelt out the theory of the vanguard party, _What is to be Done?,_ Lenin argues the point very explicitly. After discussing the limitations of the strike movement of the 1890s, he makes his central point about class consciousness and socialism: “We said that _there could not yet_ be Social-Democratic consciousness among the workers. This consciousness could only be brought to them from without. The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., it may itself realise the necessity for combining in unions, for fighting against the employers and for striving to compel the government to pass necessary labour legislation, etc. The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical and economic theories that were elaborated by the educated representatives of the propertied classes, the intellectuals. According to their social status, the founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia. Similarly, in Russia, the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose quite independently of the spontaneous growth of the labour movement; it arose as a natural and inevitable outcome of the development of ideas among the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia.’ (1966, pp. 74-75)

It has been suggested (by del Barco 1980) that the clear separation of theory (developed by bourgeois intellectuals) and experience (that of the workers) was a reflection of the particular history of the Russian revolutionary movement. Lenin’s own references, however, suggest that his ideas have a wider basis within the Marxist tradition. He quotes both Engels and Kautsky at length. Particularly significant is the passage quoted with evident approval from an article by Kautsky, in which Kautsky writes: ‘Of course, socialism, as a theory, has its roots in modern economic relationships just as the class struggle of the proletariat has, and just as the latter emerges from the struggle against the capitalist-created poverty and misery of the masses. But socialism and the class struggle arise side by side and not one out of the other; each arises under different conditions. Modern socialist consciousness can arise only on the basis of profound scientific knowledge. Indeed, modern economic science is as much a condition for socialist production as, say, modern technology, and the proletariat can create neither one nor the other, no matter how much it may desire to do so; both arise out of the modern social process. The vehicles of science are not the proletariat, but the _bourgeois intelligentsia_ [K.K.’s italics]: it was in the minds of some members of this stratum that modern socialism originated, and it was they who communicated it to the more intellectually developed proletarians who, in their turn, introduced it into the proletarian class struggle where conditions allow that to be done. Thus, socialist consciousness is something introduced into the proletarian class struggle from without (_von aussen Hineingetragenes_), and not something that arose within it spontaneously (_urwüchsig_). Accordingly, the old Hainfeld programme quite rightly stated that the task of Social-Democracy is to imbue the proletariat with the _consciousness_ of its position and the consciousness of its tasks. There would be no need for this if consciousness emerged itself from the class struggle.’ (1966, pp. 81-82)

The quotation from Kautsky makes clear that the central issue is not the peculiarities of the Russian revolutionary tradition: however important those peculiarities might have been, ascribing the problems of Leninism to them lets mainstream Marxism off the hook. The central issue is rather the concept of science or theory which was accepted by the main stream of the Marxist movement. If science is understood as an objectively ‘correct’ understanding of society, then it follows that those most likely to attain such an understanding will be those with greatest access to education (understood, presumably, as being at least potentially scientific). Given the organisation of education in capitalist society, these will be members of the bourgeoisie. Science, consequently, can come to the proletariat only from outside. If the movement to socialism is based on the scientific understanding of society, then it must be led by bourgeois intellectuals and those ‘proletarians distinguished by their intellectual development’ to whom they have transmitted their scientific understanding. Scientific socialism, understood in this way, is the theory of the emancipation of the proletariat, but certainly not of its self-emancipation. Class struggle is understood instrumentally, not as a process of self-emancipation but as the struggle to create a society in which the proletariat would be emancipated: hence the pivotal role of ‘conquering power’. The whole point of conquering power is that it is a means of liberating others. It is the means by which class-conscious revolutionaries, organised in the party, can liberate the proletariat. In a theory in which the working class is a ‘they’, distinguished from a ‘we’ who are conscious of the need for revolution, the notion of ‘taking power’ is simply the articulation that joins the ‘they’ and the ‘we’.

The genius of Lenin’s theory of the vanguard party, then, was that it developed to their logical conclusion the organisational consequences of Engels’ notion of scientific socialism. From being a negative concept in Marx (science as the negation of fetishised appearances), science in Engels becomes something positive (objective knowledge of an objective process), so that ‘unscientific’ then denotes the absence of something: absence of knowledge, absence of class consciousness. The question that Marx leaves us with (how can we, who live against and in fetishised social relations, negate this fetishism?) becomes turned around to become ‘how can the workers acquire class consciousness?’ ‘Simple’, replies Lenin, ‘since their consciousness is limited to trade union consciousness, true consciousness can only come from outside, from (us) bourgeois intellectuals.’ The inconvenient question of the material source of the bourgeois intellectual consciousness is lost, since it is seen as just the acquisition of scientific knowledge.

Marxist practice then becomes a practice of bringing consciousness to the workers, of explaining to them, of telling them where their interests lie, of enlightening and educating them. This practice, so widely established in revolutionary movements in all the world, has its roots not just in the authoritarian tradition of Leninism but in the positive concept of science which Engels established. Knowledge-about is power-over. If science is understood as knowledge-about, then there is inevitably a hierarchical relation between those who have this knowledge (and hence access to the ‘correct line’) and those (the masses) who do not. It is the task of those-in-the-know to lead and educate the masses.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n4)

It is not that scientific Marxism simply reproduces bourgeois theory: clearly the perspective is revolutionary change, the point of reference is a communist society. It introduces new categories of thought, but those categories are understood positively. The revolutionary character of the theory is understood in terms of content, not in terms of method, in terms of the what, not the how. Thus, for example, ‘working class’ is a central category, but it is taken to refer, in the manner of bourgeois sociology, to a definable group of people, rather than to the pole of an antagonistic relation. Similarly, the state is seen as the instrument of the ruling class rather than as one moment in the general fetishisation of social relations, and categories such as ‘Russia’, ‘Britain’ and so on go entirely unquestioned. The concept of revolutionary theory is much too timid. Revolutionary science is understood as a prolongation of bourgeois science rather than a radical break with it.

The Engelsian concept of science implies a monological political practice. The movement of thought is a monologue, the unidirectional transmission of consciousness from the party to the masses. A concept that understands science as the critique of fetishism, on the other hand, leads (or should lead) to a more dialogical concept of politics, simply because we are _all_ subject to fetishism and because science is just part of the struggle against the rupture of doing and done, a struggle in which we are all involved in different ways. Understanding science as critique leads more easily to a politics of dialogue, a politics of talking-listening, rather than just of talking.[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n5)

The great attraction of Leninism is of course that he cut through what we have called the tragic dilemma of revolution. He solved the problem of how those who lacked class consciousness could make a revolution: through the leadership of the Party. The only problem is that it was not the revolution that we (or they) wanted. The second part of the sentence ‘we shall take power and liberate the proletariat’ was not, and could not be, realised.

#### IV

The concept of scientific socialism has left an imprint that stretches far beyond those who identify with Engels, Kautsky or Lenin. The separation of subject and object implied by the idea of scientific socialism continues to shape the way that capitalism is understood in much modern Marxist debate. In its modern form, scientific socialism is sometimes referred to as ‘structuralism’, but the impact of the ‘scientific’ position is not limited to those who would recognise themselves as structuralists. Rather, the ‘scientific’ separation of subject and object is expressed in a whole series of categories and specialised fields of study developed by people who do not feel themselves addressed in any sense by criticisms of Engels or of modern structuralism. It is important, therefore, to get some sense of just how much modern Marxism has been marked by the assumptions of scientific socialism.

The basic feature of scientific socialism is its assumption that science can be identified with objectivity, with the exclusion of subjectivity. This scientific objectivity, it was seen, has two axes or points of reference. Objectivity is understood to refer to the course of social development: there is a historical movement which is independent of people’s will. It is also taken to refer to the knowledge which we (Marxists) have of this historical movement: Marxism is the correct ‘discovery’ of the objective laws of motion that govern social development. In each of these two axes, the objectivity shapes the understanding of both object and subject.

Although the notion of scientific Marxism has implications for the understanding of both subject and object, in so far as science is identified with objectivity, it is the object which is privileged. Marxism, in this conception, becomes the study of the objective laws of motion of history in general, and of capitalism in particular. Marxism’s role in relation to working class struggle is to provide an understanding of the framework within which struggle takes place. Marxists typically take as the point of departure, certainly not a denial of the importance of class struggle, but an assumption of it which amounts to virtually the same thing: class struggle becomes an ‘of course’,[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n6) an element so obvious that it can simply be taken for granted and attention turned towards the analysis of capitalism.

A special role falls to ‘Marxist economics’ in the analysis of history and especially of capitalism. Since the driving force of historical development is seen as lying in the economic structure of society, since (as Engels puts it) the key to social change is to be found in economics and not in philosophy, the Marxist study of economics is central to the understanding of capitalism and its development.

Marx’s _Capital_ is the key text of Marxist economics, in this view. It is understood as the analysis of the laws of motion of capitalism, based on the development of the central categories of value, surplus value, capital, profit, the tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and so on. Thus, recent discussions in Marxist economics have focused on the validity of the category of value, the ‘transformation problem’ (concerning Marx’s transformation of value into price), the validity of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and the various theories of economic crisis. As in mainstream economic discussion, much attention is devoted to defining the terms, to establishing precise definitions for ‘constant capital’, ‘variable capital’, and so on.

The understanding of _Capital_ as a book on economics is certainly supported by some of Marx’s own comments, but it owes much to the influence of Engels. Engels, who was responsible for the editing and publication of Volumes II and III of _Capital_ after Marx’s death, fostered through his editing and his comments a certain interpretation of Marx’s work as economics. In the ten years which separated the publication of Volume II (1884) and Volume III (1894), for example, he promoted the so-called ‘prize essay competition’ to see if other authors could anticipate Marx’s solution to the ‘transformation problem’, the problem of the quantitative relation between value and price, thus focussing attention on the quantitative understanding of value (cf. Howard and King (1989) pp. 21ff; Engels’ Preface to Vol. III of _Capital_). In a supplement which he wrote to Volume III on the “Law of Value and Rate of Profit,” he presents value not as a form of social relations specific to capitalist society but as an economic law valid “for the whole period of simple commodity-production ... a period of from five to seven thousand years” (Marx 1972a, pp. 899-900). It was through Engels’ interpretation that the later volumes of _Capital_ were presented to the world. As Howard and King put it: ‘he conditioned the way in which successive generations of socialists viewed Marx’s economics, both in his editions of Marx’s writings and in what he left unpublished’. (1989, p. 17)

For the Marxists of the early part of this century, Marxist economics was the keystone of the whole structure of scientific Marxism, that which provided the certainty which was the crucial moral support for their struggles. In more recent times, Marxist economics has continued to play a central role in Marxist debate, but it has acquired the newly important dimension of also dovetailing with the structure of university disciplines: for many academics Marxist economics has come to be seen as a particular (albeit deviant) school within the broader discipline of economics.

The defining feature of Marxist economics is the idea that capitalism can be understood in terms of certain regularities (the so-called laws of motion of capitalist development). These regularities refer to the regular (but contradictory) pattern of the reproduction of capital, and Marxist economics focuses on the study of capital and its contradictory reproduction. The contradictory nature of this reproduction (understood variously in terms of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall, underconsumption or disproportionality between the different departments of production) is expressed in periodic crisis and in a long-term tendency towards the intensification of these crises (or towards the collapse of capitalism). Class struggle does not play any direct part in this analysis of capitalism. It is generally assumed that the role of Marxist economics is to explain the framework within which struggle takes place. Class struggle is intersticial: it fills in the gaps left by economic analysis, does not determine the reproduction or crisis of capitalism, but affects the conditions under which the reproduction and crisis take place.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n7) Thus, for example, the left Marxists of the early part of the century, it was seen, argued that class struggle was essential to convert the crisis of capitalism into revolution: class struggle was seen as an ingredient to be added to the understanding of the objective movement of capital.

The understanding of Marxist economics as an alternative approach to a particular discipline (economics) suggests the possibility of complementing it with other disciplinary branches of Marxism, such as Marxist sociology and Marxist political science[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n8). Marxist sociology focuses principally on the question of class and the analysis of class structures, while Marxist political science has the state as its principal focus. Neither of these disciplinary approaches is as well developed as Marxist economics, but they start from the same basic understanding of Marx’s work and of the Marxist tradition, according to which Capital is a study of economics, which needs now to be complemented (since Marx did not live to do it) by similar studies of politics, society, etc.

What all these modern disciplinary strands of Marxism have in common, and what unites them with the underlying concept of scientific Marxism, is the assumption that Marxism is a theory _of_ society. In a theory _of_ society, the theorist seeks to looks at society objectively and to understand its functioning. The idea of a ‘theory _of_’ suggests a distance between the theorist and the object of the theory. The notion of a theory _of_ society is based on the suppression of the subject, or (and this amounts to the same thing) based on the idea that the knowing subject can stand outside the object of study, can look at human society from a vantage point on the moon, as it were (Gunn 1992). It is only on the basis of this positing of the knowing subject as _external_ to the society being studied that the understanding of science as objectivity can be posed.

Once it is understood as a theory of society, Marxism can be ranged alongside other theories of society, compared with other theoretical approaches which seek to understand society. Through this comparison, emphasis falls on the continuity rather than the discontinuity between Marxism and the mainstream theories of social science. Thus, Marx the economist is seen as a critical disciple of Ricardo, Marx the philosopher as a critical disciple of Hegel and Feuerbach; in Marxist sociology, there has been discussion of enriching Marxism with the insights of Weber; in Marxist political science, especially in the writings of many who claim to derive their inspiration from Gramsci, it is assumed that the purpose of a theory of the state is to understand the reproduction of capitalist society.

The understanding of Marxism in disciplinary terms, or as a theory of society, leads almost inevitably to the adoption of the questions posed by the mainstream disciplines or by other theories of society. The central question posed by mainstream social science is: how do we understand the functioning of society and the way in which social structures reproduce themselves? Marxism, in so far as it is understood as a theory _of_ society, seeks to provide alternative answers to these questions. Those authors who look to Gramsci to provide a way of providing a way of moving away from the cruder orthodoxies of the Leninist tradition, have been particularly active in trying to develop Marxism as a theory of capitalist reproduction, with their emphasis on the category of ‘hegemony’ as an explanation of how capitalist order is maintained.

The attempts to use Marx’s own categories to develop a theory of capitalist reproduction are, however, always problematic, in so far as the categories of Marxism derive from a quite different question, based not on the reproduction but on the destruction of capitalism, not on positivity but on negativity. The use of Marxist categories to answer the questions of social science inevitably involves a reinterpretation of those categories — for example a reinterpretation of value as an economic category, or class as a sociological category. The attempt to use Marxist categories to construct an alternative economics or an alternative sociology is always problematic, not because it involves a deviation from the ‘true meaning’ of ‘true Marxism’, but because the categories do not always stand up to such reinterpretation. Thus, these reinterpretations have often given rise to considerable debate and to a questioning of the validity of the categories themselves. For example, once value is reinterpreted as the basis for a theory of price, then doubts can be (and have been) raised about its relevance; once ‘working class’ is understood as a sociological category describing an identifiable group of people, then doubts can fairly be raised about the significance of ‘class struggle’ for understanding the dynamic of contemporary social development. The integration of Marxism into social science, far from giving it a secure home, actually undermines the basis of the categories which Marxists use.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n9)

The understanding of Marxism as a theory _of_ society gives rise to a particular type of social theory which can be described as functionalist. In so far as Marxism emphasises the regularities of social development, and the interconnections between phenomena as part of a social totality, it lends itself very easily to a view of capitalism as a relatively smoothly self-reproducing society, in which whatever is necessary for capitalist reproduction automatically happens. By a strange twist, Marxism, from being a theory of the destruction of capitalist society, becomes a theory of its reproduction.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n10) The separation of class struggle from the laws of motion of capitalism leads to a separation between revolution and the reproduction of capitalist society. This does not necessarily mean that the idea of revolution is abandoned: it may indeed be given up (in the name of realism), but often it is simply taken for granted (in the way that class struggle is taken for granted in so much Marxist analysis), or relegated to the future. Thus, in the future there will be revolution, but in the meantime, the laws of capitalist reproduction operate. In the future, there will be a radical break, but in the meantime we can treat capitalism as a self-reproducing society. In the future, the working class will be the subject of social development, but in the meantime capital rules. In the future, things will be different, but in the meantime we can treat Marxism as a functionalist theory, in which the ‘requirements of capital’, a phrase which recurs frequently in Marxist discussions, can be taken as an adequate explanation of what does or does not happen. The emphasis on reproduction, combined with an analysis of reproduction as class domination, leads to a view of society in which capital rules and capital’s will (or requirements) prevails. Rupture, then, if the idea is maintained at all, can only be seen as something external, something that is brought in from outside.

Functionalism, or the assumption that society should be understood in terms of its reproduction, inevitably imposes a closure upon thought. It imposes bounds upon the horizons within which society can be conceptualised. In Marxist functionalism, the possibility of a different type of society is not excluded, but it is relegated to a different sphere, to a future. Capitalism is a closed system _until_, until the great moment of revolutionary change comes. Consequently, social activity is interpreted within the bounds imposed by this closure. The relegation of revolution to a distinct sphere shapes the way in which all aspects of social existence are understood. Categories are understood as closed categories rather than as categories bursting with the explosive force of their own contradictions, as categories containing the uncontainable. That which might be (the subjunctive, the denied) is subordinated to that which is (the indicative, the positive which denies) ... at least until.

Twist and turn the issue as one may, the notion of scientific Marxism, based on the idea of an objective understanding of an objective course of history, comes up against insuperable theoretical and political objections. Theoretically, the exclusion of the subjectivity of the theorist is an impossibility: the theorist, whether Marx, Engels, Lenin or Mao, cannot look at society from outside, cannot stand on the moon. Even more damaging, the theoretical subordination of subjectivity leads to the political subordination of the subject to the objective course of history and to those who claim to have a privileged understanding of that course.

#### V

The tradition of ‘scientific Marxism’ is blind to the issue of fetishism. If fetishism is taken as a starting point, then the concept of science can only be negative, critical and self-critical. If social relations exist in the form of relations between things, it is impossible to say ‘I have knowledge of reality’, simply because the categories through which one apprehends reality are historically specific categories which are part of that reality. We can proceed only by criticising, by criticising the reality and the categories through which we apprehend that reality. Criticism inevitably means self-criticism.

In the tradition of scientific Marxism, criticism does not play a central role. Certainly there is criticism in the sense of denunciation of the evils of capitalism; but there is no criticism in the sense of the genetic criticism of identity. To be blind to fetishism is to take fetishised categories at face value, to take fetishised categories without question into one’s own thought. Nowhere has this been more disastrous in the tradition of orthodox Marxism than in the assumption that the state could be seen as the centre point of social power. A Marxism that is blind to the question of fetishism is inevitably a fetishised Marxism.[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n11)

The core of orthodox Marxism is the attempt to enlist certainty on our side. This attempt is fundamentally misconceived: certainty can only be on the other side, the side of domination. Our struggle is inherently and profoundly uncertain. This is so because certainty is conceivable only on the basis of the reification of social relations. It is possible to speak of the ‘laws of motion’ of society only to the extent that social relations take the form of relations between things.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/john-holloway/article.htm#n12) Non-fetishised, self-determining social relations would not be law-bound. The understanding of capitalist society as being bound by laws is valid to the extent, but only to the extent, that relations between people really are thing-ified. If we argue that capitalism can be understood completely through the analysis of its laws of motion, then we say at the same time that social relations are completely fetishised. But if social relations are completely fetishised, how can we conceive of revolution? Revolutionary change cannot possibly be conceived as following a path of certainty, because certainty is the very negation of revolutionary change. Our struggle is a struggle against reification and therefore against certainty.

The great attraction of orthodox Marxism remains its simplicity. It provided an answer to the revolutionary dilemma: a wrong answer, but at least it was an answer. It guided the revolutionary movement to great conquests that, in the end of the day, were not conquests at all, but dreadful defeats. If, however, we abandon the comforting certainties of orthodoxy, what are we left with? Is our scream not then reduced to the childishly naïve and self-deceptive appeal to the idea of justice, do we not return, as Luxemburg mockingly warned, ‘to that lamentable Rosinante on which the Don Quixotes of history have galloped towards the great reform of the earth, always to come home with their eyes blackened'? No, we do not. We return, rather, to the concept of revolution as a question, not as an answer.

It is vital to understand the meaning of Marx to grasp his ideas in relation to his development. In this connection, his conception of religion is one of the most important aspects of his notions.  
As early as 1842, he wrote:

I desired there to be less trifling with the label ‘atheism’ (which reminds one of children, assuring everyone who is ready to listen to them that they are not afraid of the bogy man), and that instead the content of philosophy should be brought to the people. (Letter to Ruge, November 24, 1842.)

It was quite easy to deal with religion by just being against it, but that was not good enough. ‘Everybody knows’ that Marx wrote about religion being the opium of the people, so we shall look at the entire passage from which this comes.

The foundation of irreligious criticism is: _Man makes religion_, _religion_ does not make man. Religion is indeed the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man, state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an _inverted consciousness of the world_, because they are an _inverted world_. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual _point d’honneur_, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the _fantastic realization_ of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is therefore indirectly the struggle against _that world_ whose spiritual _aroma_ is religion.

_Religious_ suffering is at one and the same time the _expression_ of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the _sigh_ of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the _opium_ of the people. (_Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_. Introduction.)

‘Everybody’ thinks that Marx was saying that religion was dope manufactured by the ruling class to keep the masses happy. The real Marx, however, was concerned with much more weighty problems. Among other things, he was thinking about how an abstract human being could exist. He concludes that one could not. ‘Man is the world of man, state, society’, and the conception of God was a necessary conception in an ‘inverted world’. Once the world was right side up, the idea would not be needed. Meanwhile we should pay attention to it.

The _Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_: Introduction contains Marx’s first mention of the proletariat. His views now took on more critical political-economic ideas, following Engels’ brilliant essay, _Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy_, which Marx was pleased to publish in the _Deutsch-Franzosiche Jahrbuecher_. (The trouble with Engels’ views on political economy was that this was the limit of his work. See _[Friedrich Engels and Marx’s Critique of Political Economy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-cyril/works/articles/engels.htm)_, Capital and Class, 62.)

Reading a French translation of James Mill’s _Elements of Political Economy_, Marx takes up Mill’s banal definition of money as the medium of exchange.

Man becomes the poorer as man, i.e., separated from this mediator, the richer this mediator becomes. Christ _represents_ originally: 1) men before God; 2) God for men; 3) men to men. Similarly, _money_ represents originally, in accordance the idea of money: 1) private property for private property; 2) society for private property; 3) private property for society. But Christ is alienated God and alienated man. God has value only insofar as he represents Christ, and man has value only insofar as he represents Christ.

Marx is certain that his view of money as the mediator is necessary to comprehend the situation of the proletariat. Any easy rejection of this view would be as useless as atheism.

The Paris Manuscripts, penned in 1844, returns to this theme.

Since the _real existence_ of man and nature has become evident in practice, through sense experience, because man has thus become evident for man as the being of nature, and nature for man as the being of man, the question about an _alien_ being, about a being above nature and man -- a question which implies admission of the unreality of nature and of man -- has become impossible in practice. _Atheism_, as a _negation of God_, has no longer any meaning, and postulates the _existence of man_ through this negation; but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation. (MECW, Vol. 3, p. 306.)

At this time, in 1843-4, Marx thought of himself as a follower of Feuerbach. But even this thinker, beloved of atheists, was not one of them. His target was not so much _religion_ but _theology_, the formal study of God, ‘the worst enemy of the awakened spirit’.

But, as Marx was to realise, Feuerbach was concerned to awaken man, but as an isolated individual. Some time in 1845, Marx scribbled eleven Theses on Feuerbach, and Theses 3, 4 and 6 particularly turn on the questions of religion.

**Thesis 4.**

Feuerbach starts off from the fact of religious estrangement [_Selbstentfremdung_], of the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world, and a secular [_wetliche_] one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done. For the fact that the secular basis lifts off from itself and establishes itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the inner strife and intrinsic contradictoriness of this secular basis. The latter must itself be understood in its contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised. Thus, for instance, once the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, former must itself be annihilated [_vernichtet_] theoretically and practically.  

**Thesis 6.**

Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [_menschliche Wesen_ = “human nature”]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations. Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged:  
1. To abstract from the historical process and to define the religious sentiment regarded by itself, and to presuppose an abstract -- isolated -- human individual.  
2. The essence therefore can by him only be regarded as “species,” as an inner “dumb” generality which unites many individuals only in a _natural_ way.

  
**Thesis 7.**

Feuerbach consequently does not see that the “religious sentiment” is itself a _social product_, and that the abstract individual that he analyses belongs in reality to a particular social form.

Marx, in these brief summaries, has thus cleared out of the way Feuerbach’s treatment of the human individual. His ‘awakening’ of man is seen to be as a social atom, and not what Marx is striving for.

Let us jump now to Marx’s chief work, which took much more than his lifetime to complete. (Its completion, by the proletarian revolution, is not yet achieved!) We begin with a quote from the _Grundrisse_, the first attempt at a critique of political economy as a whole.

"An example in the religious sphere is Christ the mediator between God and man - mere instrument of circulation between them - becomes their unity, God-man, and as such becomes more important than God; the saints more important than Christ; the priests more important than the saints. (_Grundrisse_, MECW, Vol. 29, p. 257.)

This return to our familiar theme, is part of the exposition of Marx’s of his explanation of the central importance of money.

But his treatment of this notion in _Capital_ is not the same as that we have seen in the other extracts.

The religious reflections of the real world can, in any case, vanish only when the practical relations of everyday life between man and man, and man and nature, generally present themselves to him in a transparent and rational form. The veil is not removed from the countenance of the social life-process, i.e. the process of material production, until it becomes production by freely associated men, and stands under their conscious and planned control. This, however, requires that society possess a material foundation, or a series of material conditions of existence, which in their turn are the natural and spontaneous product of a long and tormented historical development. (_Capital_, p. 173.)

Here, Marx brings together his views on religion and his historical view of the communist revolution and the growth of production generally. He relates religion to the effort to unite human beings without really understanding the sweeping historical forces which have separated them.

One more quotation, from a piece of _Capital_, the so-called ‘Sixth Chapter’, omitted from Volume 1, maintains this historical outlook.

This antagonistic stage cannot be avoided, any more than it is possible for man to avoid the stage in which his spiritual energies are given a religious definition as powers independent of himself. What we are confronted by here is the _alienation_ [_Entfremdung_] of man from his own labour. (_Capital_, p. 990.)

Here, Marx has set out his conception of religion in the light of his notion of the stages of history as a whole. First, humans see themselves as a local community, with their local gods. Then, in the era of money and exploitation, God Almighty rules over all. Finally, there is no use for Him, as humans freely govern their own lives.

### The Origins of Dialectical Materialism

In the history of Marxian thought the publication of _Anti-Dühring_ (_Herrn Eugen Dührings Umwalzung der Wissenschaft_) turned out to be an epoch-making event. Originally planned as a polemical tract with a narrowly defined objective of no more than transitory importance, [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n1) _Anti-Dühring_ gained the distinction of being the canonical statement of the doctrine which came to be known as dialectical materialism and acquired great renown all over the world. Engels is the founder of dialectical materialism but he never used its now familiar name, calling it simply ‘modern materialism’. While he saw its modernity in being dialectical, [[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n2) that is, in the application of dialectics to the phenomenon of nature, he left it to Plekhanov and Lenin to coin the new term ‘dialectical materialism’. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n3)

Although the term ‘dialectical materialism’ is of later origin, there is no doubt that the oldest and most authoritative exposition of the doctrine itself is to be found in _Anti-Dühring_. _Dialectics of Nature_, published posthumously only in 1925, is another important source of our knowledge about dialectical materialism. But while _Anti-Dühring_ gives a text fully approved and twice revised by Engels himself, _Dialectics of Nature_ is only a collection of fragments, notes, and other materials for private use, accumulated by Engels in the years 1873-83 in preparation for a book which he never managed to complete. [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n4) Therefore, it is _Anti-Dühring_ rather than _Dialectics of Nature_ that should be regarded as Engels’s fully considered formulation of dialectical materialism. The commonly accepted view that Engels wrote _Anti-Dühring_ in close collaboration with Marx has considerably enhanced its authority and reputation.

### I. The Significance of Anti-Dühring

In the spring of 1876, in response to the pressing demands of his political friends in Germany, [[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n5) Engels finally decided to settle accounts with Eugen Dühring (1833-1921), Marx’s detractor and short-lived rival for the intellectual leadership within the German Social Democratic Party. While feeling duty-bound to face Dühring’s challenge, Engels was also disgruntled and in private complaining to Marx of having to ‘go after the scalp of the boring Eugen Dühring’. [[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n6)

In the Preface to the first edition of _Anti-Dühring_ Engels emphasized that his book was by no means the fruit of any ‘inner urge’. He undertook the task of refuting Dühring’s ‘new socialist theory’ only because it was imperative to prevent sectarian quarrels and splits from developing within the Party. The popularity of Dühring was symptomatic of the revival of utopian socialism which replaced the ‘materialistic basis’ of socialism ‘by modern mythology with its goddesses of Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity’. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n7) Since Marx and he had tried to emancipate the German workers from sentimentality and socialistic day-dreams for decades, they could not allow some ‘muddleheads’ to influence the leaders of German socialism with their ‘silly, stale, and reactionary’ utopianism. However, he undertook the polemical task reluctantly, for Dühring was not a serious opponent and on his account he was forced to neglect more important work. Although Engels thought that his exposure of Herr Dühring’s ‘banalities’ and ‘sublime nonsense’, necessary as it appeared at that time, would soon become useless and fall into oblivion, two more editions of _Anti-Dühring_ were published before Engels died in 1895 and many more after that date. [[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n8)

Engels clearly had no inkling that his polemical examination of Dühring’s views would make history. The opponents of Engels in his dispute with Dühring were no more perspicacious. When _Anti-Dühring_ first began appearing in the _Vorwarts_ by instalments, some of its readers described it as ‘completely without interest’ and the annual congress of the German Social Democratic Party, held in Gotha in May 1877, nearly decided to suppress it altogether. _Anti-Dühring_ was saved from being withdrawn from further publication by the transfer from the main columns to a theoretical supplement of _Vorwarts_. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n9)

From its first publication _Anti-Dühring_ gained the reputation of being, next to _The Communist Manifesto_, the most successful work that came- as it has been believed- from the pen of Marx and Engels. Moreover, it is widely accepted that no book except _Capital_ has done as much as _Anti-Dühring_ for the dissemination of Marxian thought. Antonio Labriola called it ‘the most accomplished’ and ‘the un-excelled book in the literature of socialism’. [[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n10) According to Lenin, _Anti-Dühring_ ‘is a wonderfully rich and instructive book’. [[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n11) For Plekhanov the first part of _Anti-Dühring_ was the main and the most authoritative source from which the philosophical views of Marx and Engels could be learnt. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n12) Karl Kautsky conceded that _Capital_ was an altogether more powerful book but added that ‘only owing to _Anti-Dühring_ did we learn to read and understand _Capital_ the right way’. [[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n13) As Engels himself observed, _Anti-Dühring_ provided the most detailed account of historical materialism; [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n14) it has remained, ever since, one of the most authoritative. Few people, if any, who are interested in the views of Marx and Engels would disagree with Bertrand Russell’s opinion that the clearest statements of the materialist conception of history are to be found in _Anti-Dühring_.

The passage of time has confirmed these impressions and views about _Anti-Dühring_. As his biographer Gustav Mayer observed, what Engels considered as a thankless task turned out to be ‘the decisive blow for the conversion of Continental social democracy to Marxism’. In _Anti-Dühring_ the original views of Marx and Engels were revealed for the first time in simple and lucid language to a whole generation of social democratic leaders, writers and thinkers, to men like Bebel, Bernstein, and Kautsky in Germany, Plekhanov and P. B. Axelrod in Russia, Victor Adler in Austria, Labriola and Turati in Italy. Only upon the publication of _Anti-Dühring_ ‘were a real Marxian school and a real Marxian tradition created on the Continent of Europe’. [[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n15) Furthermore, at the suggestion of Paul Lafargue, Marx’s son-in-law, Engels extracted three chapters, the most relevant and free from polemics, from _Anti-Dühring_, which Lafargue translated into French and published in _La Revue Socialiste_ and under separate cover in 1880. This pamphlet, known in its English version under the title _Socialism: Utopian and Scientific_, caused, to Engels’s delight, a ‘real revolution in the heads of the French’. [[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n16) It was translated in its author’s lifetime into ten languages and became as famous and widely read as _The Communist Manifesto_. While the circumstances to which _Anti-Dühring_ owes its existence have long been forgotten, the book has not lost its significance many years after its publication, but continues to be read and, rightly or wrongly, is a recognized source of knowledge of Marxian theories.

### 2. The Prevailing View of the Intellectual Partnership of Marx and Engels

Dialectical materialism as formulated in _Anti-Dühring_ has been traditionally regarded as the common product of Marx and Engels. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n17) Some contemporary writers go even further and attribute dialectical materialism to Marx exclusively. According to G. A. Wetter, Marx may ‘be considered as the founder of dialectical materialism’. [[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n18) In the opinion of Henri Levebvre, the extension of _la dialectique concrete a la nature_ was accomplished by Marx and only followed by Engels under Marx’s close supervision and approval. [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n19) While eschewing this extreme point of view, others firmly dismissed as groundless the idea that Marx and Engels could differ in their views concerning the problems of the philosophy of nature. [[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n20)

The only justification of the traditional belief that _Anti-Dühring_ represents not only Engels’s but also Marx’s _Naturphilosophie_ comes from Engels himself.

I must note in passing that inasmuch as the mode of outlook expounded in this book was founded and developed in far greater measure by Marx, and only in an insignificant degree by myself, it was understood between us that this exposition of mine should not be issued without his knowledge. I read the whole manuscript to him before it was printed and the tenth chapter of the part of economics (_From the Critical History_) was written by Marx. ... As a matter of fact, we had always been accustomed to helping each other out in special subjects. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n21)

It is easy to understand why Engels’s account has been accepted uncritically by practically everybody. Engels’s statement in _Anti-Dühring_ merely brought out with specific reference to a particular issue what people had always felt to have been the case in general, namely, that the views of Marx and Engels were without exception absolutely the same.

Franz Mehring emphasized the identity of thought and intellectual development of Marx and Engels and Gustav Mayer followed in his footsteps. [[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n22) Heinrich Cunow was confident that Engels wrote nothing without the approval of Marx, who was even in the habit of seeing the proof sheets of what Engels was about to publish. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n23) M. M. Bober, an American scholar, wrote that ‘the two friends thought and worked together and it would be impossible to dissever the thoughts of one from those of the other. Even if the task were possible, it is doubtful whether it would yield fruitful results.’ [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n24) Both friends and foes, and among the former, persons as different as Karl Kautsky, Plekhanov, Lenin, Karl Vorlander, or Sir Isaiah Berlin are in full agreement that, as Kautsky put it, ‘ the totality of Marx’s and Engels’s literary production constitutes a spiritual union (_eine geistige Einheit_)’. [[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n25) According to Vorlander, from 1845 [[26]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n26) Engels’s philosophical development was interlinked in every respect with that of Marx and they could no longer be differentiated. Marx’s philosophical views may be inferred from those of Engels and what Engels said about his friend’s contribution and assistance behind the scene is inherently reliable. [[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n27) This must also have been the belief of Lenin, who in his essay _Karl Marx_ drew almost exclusively upon the works of Engels to outline Marx’s conception of materialism and dialectics. R. N. Carew Hunt described _Anti-Dühring_ in Lenin’s manner as ‘the best general exposition’ of Marx’s philosophical views, [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n28) and Sir Isaiah Berlin went even further, for he claimed that Engels ‘understood his friend’s new, only half articulated ideas sometimes better than he understood them himself’. [[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n29) It is clear from this wide range of opinions that according to the common implicitly or explicitly accepted assumptions one cannot and should not differentiate the views of Marx from those of Engels, for those views were perfectly identical. The two friends were intellectually twin brothers whose achievements constitute a living unity.

There is no reason to dispute the fact that during Marx’s lifetime Engels, with his knack of writing quickly and clearly and with his talent for popular exposition, often interpreted Marx’s main doctrines. It is right to emphasize that frequently it was owing to Engels that others first came to understand how Marx viewed the course of history and what inferences he drew from his interpretations. After Marx’s death the authority of Engels, Marx’s lifelong friend and editor of his manuscripts, increased enormously. Engels’s likeable character, his admirable honesty and humanity, his unswerving loyalty to Marx, his intellectual honesty and common sense, implicitly induced trust and confidence in his testimony. He considered himself and was recognised by others as the faithful and rightful guardian of Marx’s original thought. This does not necessarily provide the guarantee that Marx’s thought is to be found authentically in Engel’s writings. The fact that Engels was the recognized interpreter of Marx’s system and that he was also a writer in his own right prompts the re-examination of the whole question concerning Engels’s intellectual relationship to Marx.

### 3. Engels’s Tradition in the Interpretation of Marx

It was Sidney Hook who in the early thirties challenged the accepted opinion that from the beginning of their personal, intellectual, and literary friendship the views of Marx and Engels were identical. Considering the indisputable fact that they were minds of a different order, the alleged identity of views is highly implausible. In a letter to J. P. Becker, Engels frankly confessed that ‘in Marx’s lifetime I played second fiddle’. [[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n30) He wrote to Franz Mehring with his unfailing and self-revealing modesty that Marx was a man with a ‘more rapid _coup d’oeil_ and wider vision’ than himself. If after Marx’s death he was given more credit than he deserved, ‘history will set this right in the end’. Engels felt sure that:

What Marx accomplished, I would not have achieved. Marx stood higher, saw further, and took a wider and quicker view than all the rest of us. Marx was a genius, we others were at best talented. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n31)

Engels never tired of emphasizing that it was owing to Marx alone that ‘socialism became a science’. Marx made the two great discoveries, namely, he revealed the secrets of capitalist production in his theory of surplus-value and formulated the materialist conception of history. Although the second of these discoveries was attributed to both Marx and Engels, Engels claimed for himself ‘only a very insignificant share’ and publicly and consistently discounted any suggestions to the contrary. The greater part of its leading basic principles in the realm of economics and history and their final trenchant formulations belonged to Marx; he limited his own share to their elaboration and application. Similarly, _The Condition of the Working Class in England_ represented only one phase of the embryonic evolution of modern socialism which was ‘since [then] fully developed as a science, chiefly and almost exclusively through the efforts of Marx’. Notwithstanding Marx’s appreciative references to _The Condition of the Working Class in England_ and _Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy_ Engels held unflinchingly to the position that ‘what I contributed... Marx could very well have done without me’. [[32]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n32)

Engels’s self-effacement may have been exaggerated and was actually excessive. That Engels was Marx’s intellectual inferior is a fact, however, of which not only Engels himself was aware but which was also recognized by others, including some of the greatest admirers of Engels. [[33]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n33) On the other hand, there is no reason to believe that because Engels had neither the inventive genius nor the deep historical and social insight of Marx, they were divided by a gulf of more important differences of opinion. On the whole, it is enough to assume, as Hook did, that Engels gave a characteristic twist to the doctrine of Marx. [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n34)

The emphasis given by Engels to Marxian thought consists in viewing it as a monistic system concerned with the ultimate constituents and laws of the universe rather than as an application of a unified method. Thus, for instance, Engels gave final currency to the belief that _Capital_ was an exposition of a system of political economy, and not a critical, sociological, and historical analysis of a particular socio-economic formation, undertaken from the standpoint of the class-conscious proletariat of Western Europe and, above all, _eine Streitschrift_, as Eduard Bernstein put it. In philosophy, a similar shift was accomplished, for Marx, who, after his break with Hegel, was uninterested in academic metaphysics and the theory of knowledge , was presented by Engels as a supporter of dialectical materialism and naive realism. But Marx did not embrace Engels’s modern materialism; neither did he accept Engels’s theory about sensations being images or copies of the objects of the external world. These doctrines are incompatible with the views to be found in Marx’s works, with his ‘naturalistic activism’ and the conception of sensations as ‘forms of practical, sensory activity’. [[35]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n35)

If Engels had never published _Anti-Dühring_, and this might easily have happen considering the circumstances of its publication, nobody would have regarded Marx as a dialectical materialist in Engels’s sense. Marx’s own works do not contain the basic assumptions of dialectical materialism and do not justify the application of this label to their author. As has been mentioned earlier, apart from Engels’s account in the Preface to the second edition of _Anti-Dühring_, which was written and published after Marx’s death, there is no other evidence that Marx dissociated ‘history’ from ‘nature’ or differentiated between ‘dialectical’ and ‘historical’ materialism and regarded the former as logically prior to the latter.

Marx did not disavow the responsibility for the views expounded by Engels, but he need not have seen any necessity for doing so; he might have felt that there was no danger of a work of Engels being construed as an exposition of his own philosophical beliefs. In the Preface to the first edition of _Anti-Dühring_, published in Marx’s lifetime, Engels said that the criticism of Dühring’s philosophy gave him the opportunity to set forth ‘my views on controversial issues which are today of quite general scientific and practical interest’. [[36]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n36) He suggested nowhere that what he wrote committed Marx in any way. Quite a different problem is the question as to what was Marx’s opinion about Engels’s peculiar combination of science and speculative philosophy, and the most plausible answer is that Marx did not trouble to make up his mind about it. At that time Marx was entirely engrossed in his own work, above all in the completion of the remaining volumes of _Capital_, which increasingly prevented him from becoming interested in matters unrelated to his main task.

In 1873 Marx’s health began deteriorating seriously and there was constant fear that he might suffer a stroke. Although Marx temporarily rallied his ebbing strength, thanks to an extended medical treatment, annual visits to the seaside and Karlsbad, a complete recovery was never achieved. Having completed the second edition of the first volume of _Capital_ (1872) and the editing of its French translation (1875), he kept up his vast correspondence but wrote practically nothing apart from short articles. In 1878, that is, the year of the first publication of _Anti-Dühring_, Marx suffered a relapse of bad health and was able to do no more work, even on _Capital_ (the last revisions and editions incorporated in the second volume of _Capital_ date from 1878). About the same time the anxiety concerning his wife, who was suffering from cancer, began in earnest. Frau Marx died in December 1881 and, as Engels said, on the day of her death ‘the Moor also died’. [[37]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n37) One year later (January 1883) Marx suffered the second painful blow, the sudden death of his eldest daughter Jenny Longuet.

There were, therefore, ample reasons why Marx should have showed little interest in what Engels was doing, especially since at first they both regarded a reply to Dühring as a task too unimportant to be bothered about. There is really no need to explain why Marx allegedly acquiesced in the attribution of Engels’s doctrine to him, for no such attribution was actually made during his lifetime. Marx was probably entirely unaware, and he had every right to be so, of the implications which were to be drawn from _Anti-Dühring_ with respect to his own philosophical beliefs.

The fully developed division of the ‘theory of Marxism’ into dialectical materialism (providing the most general assumptions and procedures) and historical materialism (based on dialectical materialism and applying its laws to the study of society and history) can be found only in Marxism-Leninism, that is, in Lenin’s interpretation of the doctrine attributed to him by Marx and Engels. But many basic Leninist ideas are contained in their rudimentary form in _Anti-Dühring_ or are based upon the views of Engels expounded in this work. In particular, contrary to the views of some exponents, Engels tried to deduce dialectics of society from dialectics of nature and to provide the communist world outlook with a _Naturphilosophie_. [[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n38) In the Preface to the second edition of _Anti-Dühring_ Engels confessed that his work contained more than he originally intended to say. He realized _post factum_ that in his examination and refutation of Dühring’s doctrine his ‘negative criticism became positive’ and that ‘the polemic was transformed into a more or less connected exposition ofÉ the communist world outlook’. This comprehensive system which, in his opinion, was the common property of Marx and himself, comprised the views presented to the world in _The Poverty of Philosophy, The Communist Manifesto,_ and _Capital_ as well as some ‘positive conceptions’ developed alongside the polemic against the philosophy of Dühring. [[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n39) The latter ranged over a vast area of subjects, both practical and scientific, and dealt, to use Engels’s own words, ‘with everything under the sun and with some others as well’. As he frankly conceded, he followed Dühring into realms where at best he could only ‘claim to be a dilettante’ and had ‘to exercise great caution’. [[40]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n40) Engels was aware that he went further than he originally planned. He knew that he overreached himself and was uneasy about it, although later his self-criticism gave way to the pleasure which the success of _Anti-Dühring_ aroused in the author’s breast.

Notwithstanding Engels’s original uneasiness, _Anti-Dühring_ became the main source of knowledge about ‘the philosophy of Marx and Engels’. Unintentionally and somewhat unknowingly Engels established the tradition which ascribed to Marx a coherent monistic system of materialistic metaphysics in the accepted sense of this term, comprising a philosophy of nature, a theory of society, and a view of history, all three derived from a common set of first principles and logically supporting each other. _Anti-Dühring_ is the original and most important source of this tradition and, in particular, of the false belief that the materialist conception of history is closely connected with or deducible from philosophic materialism.

It was in this way that at the turn of the century _Anti-Dühring_ was read by the first generation of students and followers of Marx. ‘As its name already shows,’ wrote Bernstein, ‘the materialistic conception of history closely hangs together with a materialist world outlook.’ [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n41) The same view was voiced by Ludwig Woltmann, who claimed that ‘historical materialism is only a special application of dialectical materialism to the history of mankind, for history itself should be conceived as a segment of the universal natural process (_Naturprozess_)’. [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n42) Plekhanov conceded that the ‘general public’ often used the term ‘Marxism’ to refer to historical materialism, but he asserted that this was not correct and that historical materialism cannot be separated from ‘philosophical materialism’ to be found ‘fairly fully set forth, although in a polemical form, in the first part of Engels’s book _Herrn Eugen Dührings Umwalzung der Wissenschaft_’. [[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n43) It has rightly been said that the doctrine of Marxism, as understood by Plekhanov, came into being in the period separating the death of Marx from that of Engels. [[44]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n44) Engels’s philosophy was taken to be a faithful presentation of Marx’s original views and acquired the status of Marxian orthodoxy.

Engels’s interpretation of Marx, later codified by Lenin and Stalin into the canonical doctrine of so-called Marxism or Marxism-Leninism, was, however, subject to some important revisions. In the early twenties Georg Lukacs maintained that when Engels extended Marxian dialectics outside the realm of history and society, he misunderstood Marx entirely. [[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n45) About the same time Karl Korsch argued that Marx’s historical materialism did not need the support of philosophical materialism or even of the materialism expounded by Engels in _Anti-Dühring_. [[Den dialektiske materialismes ABC-1721248246487.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n46) Similarly, a few years later Sidney Hook claimed that Marx did not conceive of dialectical materialism as a doctrine of nature, distinct from a theory of society and history, for the attempt to apply the dialectics to nature was incompatible with his basic position. [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n47) Sidney Hook was supported by Bertrand Russell and, more recently, by a number of other scholars and historians. [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n48) If the view of these writers is essentially correct and _Anti-Dühring_ does not provide a substantially true account of Marx’s philosophy, the question arises as to how Marx’s philosophic position should still be described.

### 4. The Naturalism of Marx and the Dialectical Materialism of Engels

Marx believed that man is an object of nature; that his mind or soul is not a supernatural entity; that there is an essential unity of mind and body; and that human behaviour can be explained by means of empirical hypotheses to be tested by the procedure accepted in natural science. But these beliefs do not make of Marx a dialectical materialist, nor even a materialist in the usual sense of the word unless naturalism and materialism are considered identical.

Naturalism is usually defined as the view which regards mind as part of nature and demands that it should be investigated by the same method as that applied to other parts of nature. This brief statement is not incorrect but it does not do justice to all essential beliefs of naturalism and might lead to the confusion of materialism and naturalism.

Naturalism comprises a cosmological and methodological component. [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n49) As a cosmological doctrine, naturalism claims the self-sufficiency of nature, rejects the primacy of mind, accepts ontological pluralism, and emphasises the basic significance of the categories of time, space, and causality for the knowledge of the world. As a methodological conception, naturalism asserts that we can have reliable knowledge only of such objects as can be investigated by scientific method. Scientific method is not identified with the procedures applied in physics or biology, but with certain accredited ways or standard procedures of acquiring knowledge, such as observation, experiment, and inference, of which different sciences make use in different ways, determined by the subject-matter and the technical means available. As a rule the naturalist combines the methodological conception of naturalism with some naturalistic cosmological principles which expose him to the objection of being a concealed materialist. Marx has constantly been described as a materialist, a name which he himself did not renounce and did not wish to disclaim, and contemporary naturalism is often criticized for disguising its true nature by using a misleading name. [[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n50)

The methodological premises of naturalism imply that human behaviour can be adequately explained in terms of causal laws of the same sort as those which govern the conjunction and sequence of natural phenomena, without resorting to the teleological order of events, to ideals, values, spirit, or normative standards. To accept the existence of only such objects as can be studied by scientific method does not necessarily imply metaphysical materialism. It is important to realize this distinction although it was not clearly made and applied in the times of Marx; Marx himself used ‘materialism’ and ‘naturalism’ synonymously, perhaps because he defined materialism as the opposite of Hegelian spiritualism, that is, as the view which denies the independent existence of mind without matter.

While materialism, in some sense of the term, may be a true doctrine, it can never be known to be true. On the other hand, while materialism may be false, it can never be disproved. Since naturalism is compatible with both the truth and falsehood of materialism, naturalism cannot imply materialism and still less be identical with it, as some philosophers seem to believe. Naturalism is not a metaphysical but rather an epistemological and methodological doctrine. It is a systematic reflection upon the procedures applied in the acquisition of knowledge about the world and not a system of beliefs concerning the ultimate constituents of the world.

If the naturalism of Marx should be differentiated from the dialectical materialism of Engels, the problem arises as to how the latter emerged from the former. To answer this question, the problem has first to be extended. Naturalism is closely related to positivism and clearly opposed to metaphysics or speculative philosophy. To regard Marx as a naturalist philosopher seems to militate, therefore against the accepted view of Marx being deeply affected by Hegel and sharply critical of Comte and positivism. On the other hand, dialectical materialism is hostile to positivism and favourably disposed to speculative philosophy. This particular combination of intellectual attitudes appears in turn to be incompatible with the view that Engels is the founder of dialectical materialism, for he is, or is widely considered to be, a positivist rather than a Hegelian.

In order to disentangle this intricate cluster of conflicting influences and intellectual loyalties, the impact of Hegelianism and French positivism upon Marx and Engels has to be re-examined. There is much evidence that in their formative years both Marx and Engels were affected by these two schools of thought, which at the time were the major centres of philosophical attraction. While the examination of the relation of Marx and Engels to Hegelianism and positivism has an inherent interest of its own, it also affords an occasion for defining and explaining the important differences in their respective philosophical positions. It may also help towards an understanding of how dialectical materialism, a conception essentially alien to the philosophy of Marx, emerged from and replaced the naturalism of Marx.

Historically, the incompatibility of naturalism and positivism on the one hand and Hegelianism on the other is not as unquestionable as it might appear. F. A. Hayek introduced the term ‘Hegelian positivism’ to denote a trend among those thinkers- Ernest Renan and Hippolyte Taine in France, Marx and Engels in Germany, Benedetto Croce in Italy, John Dewey in the United States- who succeeded in combining the ideas derived from Hegel and Comte. [[51]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/jordan/article.htm#n51) ‘Hegelian positivism’ is an apt expression to designate Engels’s dialectical materialism. As presented in _Anti-Dühring,_ dialectical materialism combines the elements of three different trends of thought, namely, the naturalism of Marx, Hegelian philosophy, and French positivism. The contribution of each of these trends to the final outcome has to be examined before the historical development and logical analysis of dialectical materialism are undertaken.

### Notes

1. Engels exclaimed, ‘I have him on the hip now’, when at the planning stage he outlined the content of [_Anti-Dühring_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm) and disclosed the tactics which he intended to follow in rewarding Dühring ‘according to his just deserts’. See [Engels’ letter to Marx of 28 May 1876](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1876/letters/76_05_28.htm).

For the first time, Lenin used the expression ‘dialectical materialism’ in [_What the ‘Friends of the People’ Are_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1894/friends/01.htm), published in 1894.

4. As Engels himself imformed us, since Marx’s death his time was required for more urgent duties, that is, the publication and republication of the works and manuscripts left by Marx, above all, of the remaining volumes of _Capital_, and Engels was thus compelled to lay aside his own studies. Although he hoped that he would return to them one day, the opportunity never materialised. See Engels, _AD_, p. 19.

5. In the [Special Introduction to the English edition of _Socialism: Utopian and Scientific_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/int-mat.htm), Engels explained the political reasons why it ‘became necessary to take up the gauntlet thrown down to us [i.e. By Dühring], and to fight out the struggle whether we liked it or not’.

8. Originally _Anti-Dühring_ appeared in _Vorwärts_, the central organ of the united German Social Democratic Party. The first instalment was published in January 1877, and the last in July 1878, one and a half years later. As a separate book the first edition of _Anti-Dühring_ appeared in 1878, the second in 1885, and the third in 1894.

The scandal caused by _Anti-Dühring_ within the German Social Democratic Party was not restricted to Dühring’s supporters. Many people were shocked by the violence of Engels’s language and the content of his attack upon the blind _Privatdozent_ at Berlin University who publicly defended socialism and was persecuted by the authorities for this heinous crime. It was widely believed at that time that Dühring suffered persecution only because of his political convictions and Engels himself rose to his defence in the Preface to the second edition of _AD_. According to K. Vorlander, _Karl Marx,_ pp. 251-2, this was not, however, the case. The ostensible reason why the University Senate deprived Dühring of _veniam legendi_ was because of his offensive attacks on Helmholtz and other Berlin scientists. Apparently there was not other path for the Senate to take, since at that time Dühring’s alleged conceit rose to the height of a megalomaniac delusion. Whatever the true reasons responsible for Dühring’s loss of his _Privatdozentur_ at Berlin University were, his scholastic reputation was considerable - no lesser man than Ernst Mach spoke highly of him in _Science of Mechanics_ (Preface to the first German edition) - and Engels’s malice was both out of place and unjustifiable. When it came to defending Marx against his opponents, the kind, gentle, and modest Engels was quite capable of outdoing his friend in sarcasm, irony, invective, and ridicule.

### Note from the author

In May 1970, upon the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Friedrich Engels, the town of Wuppertal had organised an international scientific conference. This occasion brought together around 50 specialists from more than 10 European countries, as well as Israel and the United States whose task was to take stock of modern research on the thought of he who is universally taken to be, alongside his friend Karl Marx, one of the founders of “Marxism”. Invited to participate in this conference, I intended to submit as a text for the discussion a series of critical theses centred on the theme of Engels’s responsibility for the genesis of the dominant ideology of the 20th century: ‘Marxism’. It had seemed to me normal and urgent to share my critical reservations, in the context of a more ‘scientific’ than commemorative event, to an audience informed of the problems in the evolution of ideas in relation to the events and upheavals that have marked the 20th Century. I had therefore presented the organisers a document in 8 points, written in German, which I had titled “Gesichtspunkte zum thema ‘Engels als Begründer’”.

To my surprise, upon arrival in Wuppertal, I was received by the conference officials who informed me of a certain predicament: my Soviet and East German colleagues, being personally offended when reading my “Viewpoints”, were threatening to leave the conference if my contribution was not retracted from the debate! After laborious negotiation we came to an agreement on a formula which seemed likely to calm the irritation of these ‘scientific’ representatives from ‘socialist’ countries: the texts would no longer be read from the platform, but merely commented upon and discussed. It would be tempting to recount the details of the debate if the objections had merited the term ‘scientific’, and if the behaviour of certain participants hadn’t translated as a complete refusal to engage in a discussion that risked putting in question the range of ideological positions of ‘marxism-leninism’. At the same time, this obstinate if not insulting refusal, was enough to confirm to the eyes of an impartial observer the fundamental criticism that can be directed at the use of this concept of ‘Marxism’, the erroneous use of which was precisely what my “Viewpoints” denounced[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-1).

The epilogue to this conference was to further underline the solid grounding of a critique which, in the form of a simple semantic reflection, in fact represented a defence of Marx’s social theory in opposition to Marxist mythology. As it turned out, the organisers were not afraid of avoiding the elementary rules of editorial policy generally respected in ‘bourgeois’ democracies: the text (submitted at the request of the officials) was not included in the volume of collected contributions that were submitted prior to the conference[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-2). Habent sua fata libelli...[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-3)

We here present a translation of the text refused by the conference at Wuppertal, with some supporting commentary.

### Viewpoints on the Theme of “Engels the Founder”

“For the ultimate final triumph of the ideas set forth in the Manifesto, Marx relied solely upon the intellectual development of the working class, as it necessarily has to ensue from united action and discussion.”  
-F. Engels, [Preface to the 1890 German edition of the Communist Manifesto](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/preface.htm#preface-1890)

### I

Marxism did not enter the world as an authentic product of Karl Marx’s way of thinking, but was conceived in Friedrich Engels’ mind. Insofar as the term ‘marxism’ conceals a rational concept, it is not Marx but Engels who carries the responsibility; and if today Marx’s argument retains a priority, it is principally related to problems for which Engels did not find more than a partial solution, or with which he did not concern himself. Therefore, if these problems can be resolved at all, this can only be with the help of Marx himself. By no means does this mean that Engels must be excluded from discussion, but it is legitimate to question the extent to which he should be taken into account in any dealings with the writings of Marx which escaped his attention. In more general terms the question can be thus formulated: what are the limits of Engels’ competence in his role as uncontested executor of Marx’s intellectual legacy, to which we still appeal to elucidate the material and ethical problems of our time?

### II

This interrogation must examine a central problem – that of the intellectual relationship between Marx and Engels, ‘founders’ of a collection of ideological and political concepts artificially grouped under the name ‘marxism’. The fact that this question must be posed itself reveals a very characteristic phenomenon of our epoch, which one might now call the ‘myth of the 20th Century’. We should recall that the ‘founders’ sometimes themselves evoked mythological interpretation to underline the peculiar character of their friendship and intellectual collaboration: Marx was not being ironic in invoking the example of antique “Dioscures” or that of Orestes and Pylade, whilst Engels mocked the rumour according to which “Ahriman-Marx” had led “Ormuzd-Engels” astray[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-4). There is equally an opposite tendency, with increasingly frequent efforts to oppose Marx to Engels: the first would be the ‘true’ founder, the second reduced to the rank of mere ‘pseudo-dialectician’[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-5).

### III

Any investigation into the relationship between Marx and Engels is in advance destined to fail if it does not clear away the legend of the ‘foundation’ and does not take for a methodological point of departure the aporia of the concept of Marxism. It was the merit of Karl Korsch, when twenty years ago at the threshold of a radical revision of his intellectual positions, to have attempted a critique of Marxism which amounted to a declaration of war. However, Korsch simply did not dare commit the act of sweeping away the concept of Marxism and it’s mythological residues. Instead, he tried to remove this difficulty through the usage of linguistic artifices destined to conserve and to save the “important elements of the Marxist doctrine” with a view to the “reconstruction of a revolutionary theory and practice”. In his “[Ten Theses on Marxism Today](https://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm)” Korsch moves indiscriminately between speaking of the “teaching of Marx and of Engels”, “Marxist doctrine”, the “doctrine of Marx”, “Marxism” and so on[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-6). In the fifth thesis, concerning the question of the precursors, founders and continuators of the socialist movement, Korsch goes so far as to omit the name of Engels, the alter ego of Marx! Yet he was not far from the truth when he wrote:

“Today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias.”

Korsch could as well, and more accurately, have spoken of “absurd mythologies” in place of “reactionary utopias”.

### IV

In view of the impossibility of rationally defining the meaning of the concept of Marxism, it seems logical to abandon the word itself, yet it is so commonly and so universally employed. This term, degraded to the point of merely being a mystificatory slogan, carried from its birth the stigma of obscurantism. Marx struggled hard to undo this when, in the last years of his life, his reputation had broken the wall of silence which surrounded his work, and he made this categorical declaration: “ce qu’il y a de certain c’est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-7). However revealing, the fact that Engels bequeathed this warning to posterity does not relieve him of the responsibility of having given in to the temptation of lending the stamp of his authority to this unjustifiable term. Charged with being the guardian and the perpetuator of a theory, the elaboration of which he admitted to not having contributed more than a modest part[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-8), and glorifying Marx’s name in an attempt to repair the damage, Engels inadvertently promoted the genesis of a superstition, the negative consequences of which he could not have known. Today, sixty years after his death, his efforts are perfectly clear. When Engels decided to appropriate the terms ‘marxist’ and ‘marxism’ from his adversaries in order to change a hostile name into a name of honour, he could hardly have expected that, through this gesture of defiance (or was it resignation?), he would become the godfather of a mythology destined to dominate the twentieth century.

### V

The genesis of Marxist myth can be traced to the conflicts within the International. The need to hurl abuse at the opponent and their partisans made the ‘anti-authoritarians’, with Bakunin at their head, inventive enough to create such terms as ‘marxites’, ‘marxists’, and ‘marxism’. Gradually Marx’s disciples in France developed the habit of accepting these denominations which they had not created and which destined them to be distinguished from other socialist factions, so that finally these terms became political and ideological labels. From then on only the authority of Engels was necessary to sanction the usage of these terms, the ambiguity of which may not have been evident to those who used them. Engels was from the outset energetically hostile to their usage; he knew better than anyone that it risked corrupting the profound significance of a teaching that should have been considered the theoretical expression of a social movement and by no means as a doctrine invented by an individual for the benefit of an intellectual elite. His resistance did not weaken until when, in 1889, the dissent between, on one hand the ‘possibilists’, ‘blanquistes’ and ‘broussistes’, and on the other hand the ‘collectivists’ and ‘guesdistes’, threatened to cause a rupture in the movement in France, each faction having decided to organize its own international Workers’ Congress. Engels’ predicament is obvious; he attempted to avert danger of confusion and of verbal and ideological corruption by using inverted commas to speak of “Marxists” and of “Marxism”, and by speaking of “so-called Marxists”. When Paul Lafargue expressed his apprehension in seeing his group pass for a “faction” amongst others in the Workers Movement, Engels replied “we have never called you anything other than the ‘so-called Marxists’ and I cannot know what to call you otherwise. If you have another name as short, tell us and we will duly call you that with pleasure.”[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-9)

### VI

If Nietzsche published Ecce Homo for fear of one day being canonized by disciples for which he did not at all wish, the same precaution did not seem necessary in the case of Marx, even though he had not written and published more than a fragment of his projected oeuvre. Nevertheless, the printed and unpublished material which he had bequeathed to posterity amounted to a rigorous formal prohibition against linking his name to the cause for which he had fought, and to a teaching for which he believed himself mandated by the anonymous mass of the modern proletariat. If Engels had respected this prohibition as Marx’s executor, and had applied his veto to the abusive term, the universal scandal of ‘marxism’ would never have seen the light of day; but Engels committed the unpardonable error of supporting this abuse, and thus acquired the dubious honour of being the first ‘Marxist’. It is tempting to see it as the punishment of destiny that, believing himself heir, he was in truth the founder – albeit involuntarily – of ‘Marxism’. The “irony of history” which Engels loved to invoke had played a cruel trick on him. He thus became a prophet in spite of himself when on his 70th birthday he pronounced the regretful words: “my destiny willed that I harvest the honour and the glory sowed by a greater man than I; Karl Marx”[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-10). For his 150th anniversary, we must acknowledge in Engels the contestable merit and the more dubious title of ‘founder of Marxism’.

### VII

In the history of Marxism and the cult of Marx, Engels is at the forefront. We are familiar enough with the human and quasi-religious aspect of this friendship, which does not require particular analysis. On the other hand, what necessitates a thorough examination is the effect of the friendship as much upon Marx himself as on his epigones and his distant disciples. Always ready to act as pioneer of Marx’s theories, Engels expressed many ideas which Marx could not, of course, accept without critique; the silence of Marx can be explained by his desire to scrupulously respect the solidarity which he held with his friend. We cannot confirm the extent to which he should be identified with everything that Engels had said or written, but this problem is minor, considering his acknowledged admiration for the intellectual gifts of his friend: after all, he considered himself Engels’ disciple[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-11). That which Marx did not allow himself has today become a strict duty: we must break the bewitching charm of this legend, and determine the place of Engels’ oeuvre in the development of the intellectual inheritance of socialism, in relation to the destiny of the workers’ movement.

### VIII

It is only if one understands that Engels had the makings of a founder that one will grasp the reasons for which he went about the duties of editor and perpetuator of the manuscripts of Marx in a manner which, today more than ever, demands some critique[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#foot-12). The writings of Marx neglected by Engels (amongst others the preparatory works for the doctoral thesis, the Kreuznach anti-Hegelian manuscript, the economico-philosophical sketches of Paris and of Brussels, the Economic Manuscripts of 1857-1858 (_The Grundrisse_), the numerous workbooks and the correspondence with third parties) did not only place the researcher and specialist before entirely new interpretive problems; they erected new categories and created new generations of readers who could not and would not content themselves with the stereotyped phraseology of professional Marxists. The real imperative is to understand a world and to live and act in a time when ideology, mechanization and manipulation of consciousness are allied with pure violence, to change the world into a vale of tears.

### §

The theses sketched here above constitute the introduction to a debate whose essential theme must be the problem of Marxism as the mythology of our era. The question of the extent to which Engels can be held responsible for the genesis of this universal superstition is secondary to the extent that we can affirm, if we recognize the teaching of Marx the ‘materialist’, that ideologies- amongst which Marxism in all its variants should be placed – do not fall from the sky; they are essentially bound to the class interests which are at the same time the interests of power. It is enough to recognize in Engels the legitimate inheritor of Marx’s thought to denounce in his name and to his honour, the established ‘Marxism’ as a school of confusion and misguided ways for our age of iron.

M. Rubel, 1972.

“In order to fulfill the program of the final day, the council of the conference had decided to give up the discussion after the 6th session, and to begin after the 7th with the general debate. Firstly, Maximilien Rubel was supposed to have continued (?) to expound his conception. He submitted a text to the conference which was a polemical formulation against Engels, but did not then present this text before the assembly (with good reason!). These 8 theses which were, in accordance with the author’s intention, to provoke a debate on the actual significance of Marxism, may be summarised as follows: after Marx’s death, Engels made great efforts to elevate the term ‘Marxism’ formed by Marx’s adversaries, to the rank of an intelligible and definable concept. In doing this, Engels became the founder of a hybrid system of thought which was alien to the intentions of Marx himself. After the death of Engels, the ideological germs of this system were transformed into a conceptual methodology necessarily dependent upon certain class conditions.” [p. 255 ff.]

The report then mentions a polemic in opposition to mine, from a preceding session, from an East-German Marxist, about the concept of a “historic mission”, a controversy, “in which Engels did not play more than an indirect role” [ibid.]

Much could be said about the “abridged report” which summarises my theses and the “polemic” which they had provoked. I would simply affirm, however, that my text “against Engels” was simply the critique of a historically negative act by the closest and most active collaborator of Marx, and against a certain school of Marxist thought, the existence of which constitutes the negation of all that Marx and Engels themselves did for socialist thought and the workers movement. I continue to believe that my contribution responded, more than any other, to the true ‘scientific’ spirit of that conference, in the memory of he who invented the notion of ‘scientific socialism’, and who equally identified this notion with ‘critical socialism’. The conference could not offer a real homage to the man whom it intended to celebrate if it did not take as a guiding thread in its debates these words of Engels’:

“The workers movement rests on the most rigorous critique of existing society. The critique is the vital element. How could it absent itself from critique, or prohibit debate?” (Engels to Gerson Trier, 18th December, 1889).

There are even instances in which the two friends are spoken of as if they acted as a single person: for example “Marx and Engels says” (see Marx to Engels August 1st, 1856.)

[5.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#doc-5) See, for example, the opposition that Iring Fetscher established between Marx’s “philosophy of the proletariat”, and that of Engels. Fetscher explores their different ways of envisaging the “negation of philosophy” and the relation of human history to nature in the conception – which was unacceptable for Marx – of an objective dialectics of nature, and of thought as a reflection of reality. See I. Fetscher, Karl Marx und der Marxismus. Von der Philosophie des Proletariats zur proletarischen Weltanschauung, Munchen, 1987, p. 182 ff. See also Donald C.

[editorial note – a translation of this text is available: [Ten Theses on Marxism Today](https://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm)]

[7.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#doc-7) Engels specifies that this declaration was made by Marx with regards to the “Marxism” which was rampant between 1879-1880 “amongst certain of the French”, but the blame also applies to a group of intellectuals and students within the German party; they, together with the opposition press, exhibited a distorted and disfigured “Marxism” (see Engels’s letter to the editors of Socialdemokrat, 7th September 1890, published in the journal, 18th September 1890). This quip of Marx’s, so full of foreboding, was reported by Engels every time the occasion arose; see his letters to [Bernstein, 3rd November, 1882](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1882/letters/82_11_02.htm), to [Carl Schmidt, 5th August, 1890](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1890/letters/90_08_05.htm), and to Paul Lafargue, 27th August, 1890. G. A. Lopatine, the Russian revolutionary, met Engels to discuss the perspectives for Russian revolution in September 1883. He recounted some details of their talks in a letter to a member of the Norodnaiia Voliia containing the passage: “You should remember what I told you once – that Marx himself was never a Marxist. Engels reported that at the time of the struggle of Brousse, Malon, and Cie against the others, Marx said with laughter one day that ‘I can say just one thing; that I am not a Marxist!’” See the extract from Lopatine’s letter to M. N. Oshanina of 20th September, 1888, translated from Russian, in Marx-Engels-Werke 21, p. 489. However, there is no humorous tone to Marx’s letters to his friend when, on a trip to France, he communicated his impressions of the arguments of the socialists in the competing congresses of the Possibilists in Saint-Etienne, and the Guesdists in Roanne in Autumn 1882. “The Marxists and the anti-Marxists”, he wrote, “both types have done their best to ruin my trip to France” (Marx to Engels, September 30th, 1882). On his disagreement with the Russian ‘Marxists’, see [Marx to Vera Zasulich, 1881](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/zasulich/reply.htm), on the possibilities of the Russian peasant commune. On the relations between Marx and Engels and their Russian disciples, see Die russische Kommune. Kritik eines Mythos, Herausgegeben von M. Rubel, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, 1972.

[8.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#doc-8) The formal declarations of Engels in this respect are too numerous to be recounted here. Let us say simply that there is not the slightest doubt regarding the paternity of the great scientific discoveries, which are all, without exception, attributable only to Marx. Of all his declarations, the most significant is perhaps the note inserted by Engels in a writing which was to demonstrate the continuity of German philosophy in elevating its most dignified inheritor, Karl Marx, to the rank of founder of a system. See Engels, [Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy, 1888](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm). It is in this work that Engels made the official gesture of baptising the theory with Marx’s name: “Out of the dissolution of the Hegelian school, however, there developed still another tendency, the only one which has borne real fruit. And this tendency is essentially connected with the name of Marx.” Engels repeated this act in the note where he remarks that “What Marx accomplished I would not have achieved. [...] Marx was a genius; we others were at best talented. Without him the theory would not be by far what it is today. It therefore rightly bears his name.” We should not then be surprised at the conclusion to this critique, which consecrates Marx as both inheritor and founder of a philosophical school: “The German working-class movement is the inheritor of German classical philosophy.” Engels had thus cast the die.

[9.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/maximilien-rubel/article.htm#doc-9) [Engels to Lafargue, 11th May, 1889](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1889/letters/89_05_11.htm). Once engaged in this verbal concession, Engels could no longer back out, and he had to go all the way. His mind was made up the moment he felt assured of the triumph of the collectivists led by Guesde and Lafargue: “But the advantage gained over the anarchists after 1873 was put into question by their successors, and I did not therefore have a choice. Now that we are victorious, we have proved to the world that almost all of the socialists in Europe are ‘Marxists’. It will drive them crazy that they gave us that name and they will be left with Hyndman to console them” ([Engels to Laura Lafargue, 11 June, 1889](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1889/letters/89_06_11.htm)). Ironically it is precisely the same Hyndman whom Marx had advised against referring to his name in the program of the new English party. “In the party programs we should avoid everything which leads to the appearance of a direct dependence on a particular author or a particular book” (Marx to Henry Mayers Hyndman, 2 July, 1881).

CXXVII ff., for the list of the discoveries which Marx regarded as being his own. Marx attributed to himself neither the founding of historical materialism, nor the discovery of surplus value. However, this attribution – an act of Engels’s – was tacitly approved by Marx. See, for example, the account given by Engels in _Das Volk_, 1859, and the [biographical article on Marx](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/06/karl-marx.htm) in _Volkskalendar_ 1877.

### 7. The Continuity in Marx's Thought

---

Our presentation of Marx's concept of human nature, alienation, activity, etc., would be quite one-sided and, in fact, misleading if they were right who claim that the ideas of the "young Marx" contained in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts were abandoned by the older and mature Marx as remnants of an idealistic past connected with Hegel's teaching. If those who make this claim were right, one might still prefer the young to the old Marx, and wish to connect socialism with the former rather than with the latter. However, there is fortunately no such need to split Marx into two. The fact is that the basic ideas on man, as Marx expressed them in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, and the ideas of the older Marx as expressed in Capital, did not undergo a basic change; that Marx did not renounce his earlier views, as the spokesmen of the above-mentioned thesis claim.

First of all, who are those who claim that the "young Marx" and the "old Marx" have contradictory views on man? This view is presented mainly by the Russian Communists; they can hardly do anything else, since their thinking, as well as their social and political system, is in every way a contradiction of Marx's humanism. In their system, man is the servant of the state and of production, rather than being the supreme aim of all social arrangements. Marx's aim, the development of the individuality of the human personality, is negated in the Soviet system to an even greater extent than in contemporary capitalism. The materialism of the Communists is much closer to the mechanistic materialism of the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie that Marx fought against, than to Marx's historical materialism.

The Communist party of the Soviet Union expressed this view by forcing G. Lukacs, who was the first one to revive Marx's humanism, to a "confession" of his errors when Lukacs was in Russia in 1934, after being forced to escape from the Nazis. Similarly, Ernst Bloch, who presents the same emphasis on Marx's humanism in his brilliant book Das Prinzip Hoffnung (The Principle Hope), [[100]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n100) suffered severe attacks from Communist party writers, despite the fact that his book contains a number of admiring remarks about Soviet Communism. Aside from the Communist writers, Daniel Bell has recently taken the same position by claiming that the view of Marx's humanism based on the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts "is not the historical Marx." "While one may be sympathetic to such an approach," says Bell, "it is only further myth-making to read this concept back as a central theme of Marx." [[101]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n101)

It is indeed true that the classic interpreters of Marx, whether they were reformists like Bernstein, or orthodox Marxists like Kautsky, Plechanow, Lenin or Bucharin, did not interpret Marx as being centered around his humanist existentialism. Two facts mainly explain this phenomenon. First, the fact that the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts were not published before 1932, and were unknown until then even in manuscript form; and the fact that German Ideology was never published in full until 1932, and for the first time in part only in 1926. [[102]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n102) Naturally, these facts contributed a great deal to the distorted and one-sided interpretation of Marx's ideas by the above-mentioned writers. But the fact that these writings of Marx were more or less unknown until the early twenties and the thirties, respectively, is by no means a sufficient explanation for the neglect of Marxist humanism in the "classic" interpretation, since Capital and other published writings of Marx, such as the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law (published in 1844) could have given a sufficient basis to visualize Marx's humanism. The more relevant explanation lies in the fact that the philosophical thinking of the time from the death of Marx to the 1920's was dominated by positivistic-mechanistic ideas which influenced thinkers like Lenin and Bucharin. It must also not be forgotten that, like Marx himself, the classic Marxists were allergic to terms which smacked of idealism and religion, since they were well aware that these terms were to a large extent, used to hide basic economic and social realities.

For Marx this allergy to idealistic terminology was all the more understandable, since he was deeply rooted in the spiritual, though nontheistic tradition, which stretches not only from Spinoza and Goethe to Hegel, but which also goes back to Prophetic Messianism. These latter ideas were quite consciously alive in socialists like St. Simon and Moses Hess, and certainly formed a great part of the socialist thinking of the nineteenth-century and even of the thinking of leading socialists up to the First World War (such as Jean Jaurès).

The spiritual-humanistic tradition, in which Marx still lived and which was almost drowned by the mechanistic-materialistic spirit of successful industrialism, experienced a revival, although only on a small scale in individual thinkers, at the end of the First World War, and on a larger scale during and after the Second World War. The dehumanization of man as evidenced in the cruelties of the Stalinist and Hitler regimes, in the brutality of indiscriminate killing during the war, and also the increasing dehumanization brought about by the new gadget-minded consumer and organization man, lead to this new expression of humanistic ideas. In other words, the protest against alienation expressed by Marx, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, then muted by the apparent success of capitalist industrialism, raised its voice again after the human failure of the dominant system, and led to a re-interpretation of Marx, based on the whole Marx and his humanist philosophy. I have mentioned already the Communist writers who are outstanding in this humanist revisionism. I should add here the Yugoslav Communists who, although they have not as far as I know raised the philosophical point of alienation, have emphasized as their main objection to Russian Communism their concern for the individual as against the machinery of the state, and have developed a system of decentralization and individual initiative which is in radical contrast to the Russian ideal of centralization and of complete bureaucratization.

In Poland, East Germany and Hungary, the political opposition to the Russians was closely allied to the representatives of humanist socialism. In France, Germany and to a smaller extent in England, there is lively discussion going on regarding Marx which is based on a thorough knowledge and understanding of his ideas. Of literature in German, I mention only the papers contained in the Marxismusstudien, [[103]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n103) written largely by Protestant theologians; French literature is even larger, and written by Catholics [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n104) as well as by Marxists and non-Marxist philosophers. [[105]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n105)

The revival of Marxist humanism in English-speaking countries has suffered from the fact that the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts had never been translated into English until recently. Nevertheless, men like T. B. Bottomore and others share the ideas on Marxist humanism represented by the aforementioned writers. In the United States, the most important work which has opened up an understanding of Marx's humanism is Herbert Marcuse's Reason and Revolution; [[106]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n106) Raya Dunayevskaya's Marxism and Freedom, with a preface by H. Marcuse, [[107]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n107) is also a significant addition to Marxisthumanist thought.

Pointing to the fact that the Russian Communists were forced to postulate the split between the young and the old Marx, and adding the names of a number of profound and serious writers who negate this Russian position does not, however, constitute a proof that the Russians (and D. Bell) are wrong. While it would transcend the limits of this volume to attempt as full a refutation of the Russian position as is desirable, I shall try, nevertheless, to demonstrate to the reader why the Russian position is untenable.

There are some facts which, superficially appraised, might seem to support the Communist position. In German Ideology, Marx and Engels no longer used the terms "species" and "human essence" ("Gattung" and "menschliches Wesen"), which are used in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Furthermore, Marx said later (in the preface to The Critique of Political Economy, 1859) that in German Ideology he and Engels "resolved to work out in common the opposition of our view to the ideological view of German philosophy, in fact, to settle accounts with our erstwhile philosophical conscience." [[108]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n108) It has been claimed that this "settling of accounts" with their erstwhile philosophical conscience meant that Marx and Engels had abandoned the basic ideas expressed in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. But even a superficial study of German Ideology reveals that this is not true. While German Ideology does not use certain terms such as "human essence," etc., it nevertheless continues the main trend of thought of the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, especially the concept of alienation.

Alienation, in German Ideology, is explained as the result of the division of labor which "implies the contradiction between the interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals who have intercourse with one another." [[109]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n109) In the same paragraph the concept of alienation is defined, as in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, in these words: "man's own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him." [[110]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n110) Here, too, we find the definition of alienation with reference to circumstances already quoted above: "This crystallization of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us, growing out of our control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now." [[111]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n111), [[112]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n112)

Fourteen years later, in his polemic with Adam Smith (in 1857-8), Marx used the same allegedly "idealistic" arguments which he used in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, arguing that the need to work does not constitute in itself a restriction of freedom (provided it is not alienated work). Marx speaks of the "selfrealization" of the person, "hence [of] true freedom." [[113]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n113) Eventually, the same idea that the aim of human evolution is the unfolding of man, the creation of the "wealthy" man who has overcome the contradiction between himself and nature and achieved true freedom, is expressed in many passages of Capital, written by the mature and old Marx. As quoted earlier, Marx wrote in the third volume of Capital: "Beyond it [the realm of necessity] begins that development of human power, which is its own end, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can flourish only upon that realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day is its fundamental premise." [[114]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n114)

In other parts of Capital, he speaks of the importance of producing "fully developed human beings," [[115]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n115) the full development of the human race," [[116]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n116) and "man's necessity to develop himself," [[117]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n117) and of the "fragment of a man" as the result of the process of alienation. [[118]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n118)

Since D. Bell is one of the few American writers interested in Marx's concept of alienation, I want to demonstrate why his position, which is in effect the same as that taken by the Russian Communists, for exactly the opposite motives, is also untenable. Bell's main claim is that to interpret Marx from the standpoint of the humanist writers quoted above is further myth-making. He claims that "Marx had repudiated the idea of alienation, divorced from the economic system, and, by so doing, closed off a road which would have given us a broader, more useful analysis of society and personality than the Marxiam dogmatics which have prevailed."

This statement is both ambiguous and erroneous. It sounds as if Marx, in his late writings, had repudiated the idea of alienation in its human meaning, and transformed it into a "purely economic category," as Bell says later on. Marx never repudiated the idea of alienation in its human sense, but he claimed that it cannot be divorced from the concrete and real life process of the alienated individual. This is something quite different from putting up the straw man of the "old Marx" who repudiates the "young Marx's" concept of human alienation. Bell must make this error because he accepts the whole cliché of the conventional interpretation of Marx. "For Marx the only social reality is not Man, nor the individual, but economic classes of men. Individuals and their motives count for naught. The only form of consciousness which can be translated into action -- and which can explain history, past, present and future -is class consciousness." In trying to show that Marx was not interested in the individual, but only in the mass, just as he was allegedly no longer interested in human, but only in economic factors, Bell does not see -- or does not mention -- that Marx criticized capitalism precisely because it destroys individual personality (as he criticized "crude communism" for the same reason), and that the statement that history can be explained only by class-consciousness is a statement of fact, as far as previous history is concerned, not an expression of Marx's disregard of the individual.

Unfortunately Bell misquotes a Marx text which is of decisive importance in order to prove his thesis. He says of Marx: "But in saying there is no human nature 'inherent in each separate individual' (as Marx does in the sixth thesis on Feuerbach) but only classes, one introduces a new person, a new abstraction."

What does Marx say in the sixth thesis on Feuerbach? "Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each separate individual. In its reality it is the ensemble (aggregate) of social relations. Feuerbach, who does not enter more deeply into the criticism of this real essence, is therefore forced: 1) to abstract from the process of history and to establish religious temperament as something independent and to postulate an abstract -- isolated -- human individual. 2) The essence of man can therefore be understood only as 'genus,' the inward, dumb generality which naturally unites the many individuals." [[119]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/notes.htm#n119) Marx does not say, as Bell quotes, that "there is no human nature inherent in each separate individual," but something quite different, namely, that "the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each individual." It is the essential point of Marx's "materialism" against Hegel's idealism. Marx never gave up his concept of man's nature" (as we have shown by quoting the statement from Capital) but this nature is not a purely biological one, and not an abstraction; it is one which can be understood only historically, because it unfolds in history. The nature (essence) of man can be inferred from its many manifestations (and distortions) in history; it cannot be seen as such, as a statistically existing entity "behind" or "above" each separate man, but as that in man which exists as a potentiality and unfolds and changes in the historical process.

In addition to all this Bell has not properly understood the concept of alienation. He defines it as "the radical dissociation into a subject that strives to control his own fate and an object which is manipulated by others." As follows from my own discussion, as well as that of most serious students of the concept of alienation, this is a completely inadequate and misleading definition. In fact, it is just as inadequate as Bell's assertion that Zen Buddhism (like other "modern tribal and communal philosophies" of "reintegration") aims "at losing one's sense of self" and thus is ultimately antihuman because they [the philosophers of reintegration, including Zen] are anti-individual. There is no space to refute this cliché, except to suggest a more careful and less biased reading of Marx and of Zen Buddhist texts.

To sum up this point of the alleged difference between the young and the mature Marx: it is true that Marx (like Engels), in the course of a lifetime, changed some of his ideas and concepts. He became more adverse to the use of terms too close to Hegelian idealism; his language became less enthusiastic and eschatological; probably he was also more discouraged in the later years of his life than he was in 1844. But in spite of certain changes in concepts, in mood, in language, the core of the philosophy developed by the young Marx was never changed, and it is impossible to understand his concept of socialism, and his criticism of capitalism as developed in his later years, except on the basis of the concept of man which he developed in his early writings.

#### I

If the question about the "real" Marx is to have any sense, it can be neither merely factual and historical nor merely subjective and evaluative. The "real" Marx can be neither a heap of historical "facts" nor a free creation of somebody's imagination. He can be neither an entirely "objective" Marx, which once upon a time existed "in itself," nor a purely "subjective" Marx who somebody finds likeable or useful. It is impossible to expound the first, and the second is more than one man. The "real" Marx is the Marx to whom history owes a debt, and the "real" Marx's philosophy is Marx's contribution to the development of philosophical thought.

#### II

Stalinists and those who practice Stalinist criticism, while rejecting it in word, oppose the "old" Marx to the "young," maintaining that the "real" Marx is the "old." They find the "young" Marx interesting merely as an historical document, a testimony to Marx's original immaturity and his gradual emancipation from Hegelian and Feuerbachian errors. By their outcry against the "young" Marx they hope to conceal the fact that they have departed equally far from the "old" Marx. Marxism is a philosophy of freedom, and Stalinism a "philosophical" justification of unfreedom.

#### III

The thesis that the "real" Marx is the "young" one represents the first, ill-considered reaction of awakened Marxist thought against Stalinism. It is a negation of Stalinism that makes concessions to Stalinism. Its supporters accept the opposition between the "young" and the "old" Marx and at the same time magnanimously surrender the "old" Marx to the Stalinists.

#### IV

The theory of alienation is not only the central theme of Marx's "early" writings; it is also the guiding idea of all his "later" works. The theory of man as a being of praxis is not a discovery of the "old" Marx; we already find it in a developed form in the "young" one. The "young" and the "old" Marx are essentially one and the same: Marx the fighter against self-alienation, dehumanization and exploitation; Marx the combatant for the full humanization of man, for a many-sided development of man's human possibilities, for the abolition of class society and for the realization of an association in which the "free development of each is a condition of free development for all."

#### V

The unity of Marx's essential thought does not preclude its development. Marx's work is an unremitting self-criticism, a continuous revision of his own views. The division into the "young" and the "old" Marx only very incompletely describes this complex process. It is usually held that the "mature" Marx begins with the _Poverty of Philosophy_ and the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_. The Marx of the doctoral thesis, the Marx of the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ and the Marx of the _German Ideology_ are supposed to be one and the same "young" Marx; the Marx of the _Manifesto_ and the Marx of _Capital_, one and the same "old" Marx. In fact Marx in _German Ideology_ is considered as quite different from Marx in _Poverty of Philosophy_ or the _Manifesto_. But not only is the opposition between the "young" and the "old" Marx untenable; even the twofold division of Marx's development, which this opposition assumes, is dubious.

#### VI

The fundamental coherence of Marx's thought does not mean that it is an all-embracing and finished system. The essential truthfulness of Marx's thought does not mean that it is an eternal truth for all time. Marx's work is full of open problems; it contains questions without answers, searches without final results. Some people find definitive solutions in Marx precisely where he himself saw difficulties. But what was merely a question for Marx _cannot_ be a ready answer for us; what Marx himself regarded as a solution _may_ become a problem for us. Great thinkers cast light far into the future, but every generation has to work out for itself a concrete solution to its own problems.

#### VII

Some people still think that the "old" Marx definitively parted company with philosophy and philosophical "phraseology." But what kind of "phraseology" is it when Marx in the first volume of _Capital_ indicts bourgeois society because in it "a general or a banker plays a great part, but mere man [man as man], on the other hand, a very shabby part"? Or when in the third volume he writes about the conditions of production that are most adequate to the "human nature" of the producers. Marx's thought has a philosophical meaning when he, as in _German Ideology_, directly renounces philosophy and also when he, as in _Capital_, maintains that he is only flirting with it.

#### VIII

Nevertheless, in many respects Marx merely indicated his philosophy. Engels' and Lenin's philosophical works - _Anti-Dühring_ and _Dialectics of Nature_, _Materialism and Empiriocriticism_ and _Philosophical Notebooks_ - are regarded by some as a worthy supplement to Marx, and by others as a complete failure, inadequate to the basic sense of Marxism. In fact, Engels, Plekhanov, and Lenin were right in feeling the need to develop more explicitly and fully the ontological foundations of Marx's philosophy. It is not their fault if they were unable to do it on the level on which it could have been done by Marx himself. Undoubtedly the development of the ontologico-epistemological foundations of Marx's philosophy still needs to be done. It is illusory to think that a "pure" anthropology or an "ontology of man" free from general ontological assumptions is possible. It is a dubious idea also that questions of general ontology are merely a part of an ontology of man.

#### IX

It is the task of followers of Marx to develop his thought in all directions. One of the aspects of this task is a critical analysis and evaluation of new philosophical trends and phenomena. To be sure, there are some "Marxists" who do not see the difference between a Marxist criticism of non-Marxist philosophy and an inconsistent yielding to it. The only consistent Marxist for them is Comrade Ostrich, who in burying his head in the sand clearly draws the boundaries between himself and "the seemingly new philosophical schools and little schools" (and the external world in general). In his attempt to evade an independent analysis of new phenomena the dogmatist simply labels them old. Creative Marxism has no reason to follow his example.

#### I

The question about continuity or discontinuity is one of the most important and most topical in connection with Marx's thought, which is not to say that it is a vital question only in connection with Marx. There is no thinker for whom it is without consequence, because in putting this question we are really asking whether we have to do with one or a number of different thinkers. It has, however, a special significance where Marx is concerned, not only because very different answers to this question have been given and ardently defended in regard to him but also because these diverse "theoretical" answers have been connected with divergent "practical" aims and actions.

The thesis that there is a discontinuity in Marx's thought has mainly appeared, and still appears, in the theory about the fundamental differences between the "young" or "immature" Marx, represented by his works up to 1844-1845 (according to others up to 1847-1848), and the "old" or "mature" Marx, represented by his later works. This theory has many different variants.

In "Marxism"-Stalinism the theory is concretized into the thesis that the mature Marx, the sober scientist-economist, transcended and made uninteresting the young Marx, the abstract philosopher-dreamer. Criticizing the "young" Marx's philosophical idealism and political liberalism, Stalinists affect being consistent revolutionaries fighting against what is non-Marxist in the young Marx, against the misuse of Marx's juvenile failings and mistakes by the enemies of socialism. However, the question irresistibly imposes itself: is not the alleged purification of the young Marx from "Hegelianism" and "bourgeois liberalism" in fact a "cleansing" of Marx's thought from its humanistic essence, a pragmatic "preparation" for making it serviceable as a theoretical justification of bureaucratic, antisocialist practice?

Among non-Marxists, too, there are adherents of the thesis who hold that the old, "scientific" Marx, and not the young, "confused" one, is the "real" Marx; that although Marx's political economy is relatively the most valuable part of his theoretical work, it is none the less basically wrong, or at least outdated. It is becoming more and more frequent, however, among the critics of Marxism to make this opposition in favor of the "young" Marx, and simultaneously to belittle the thought of the "young" Marx by declaring it an ill-considered synthesis of Hegel and Feuerbach. In both cases the question naturally arises: is not the aim of proclaiming either the "old" or the "young" Marx the only "true" Marx to restrict Marxism to a more narrow field (in which the critic feels more confident), and thus to make criticism of it easier?

The thesis that there is a continuity in Marx's thought has also been interpreted in various ways, and its adherents have been accused of holding that Marx's conceptions never changed at all, but always remained exactly the same. Conceived in this way, the continuity thesis is obviously unfounded and it would be strange for anybody to advocate it, since it implies that Marx was a narrow-minded theoretician incapable of any development. And were anyone to try to defend it, it would be easy to refute him; it is not difficult to show that some of Marx's essential views changed considerably.

I believe in the continuity of Marx's thought, by which I do not mean that his views never changed, that he was, so to speak, born with the beard, but rather, that there are not two fundamentally different and mutually unconnected Marxes. From his high school years to his death, Marx's thought was constantly changing, but there were no such turns in this process as would represent a complete break with former ideas and the passage to entirely different or even opposite conceptions. The "young" Marx is not an "abstract philosopher," nor is the "old" an "austere scientist": Marx's thought from beginning to end is a revolutionary humanism, and only when it is considered as a whole can it serve as an adequate theoretical basis of the revolutionary struggle for a democratic, humanistic socialism.

#### II

It is not difficult to formulate briefly the thesis about the continuity of Marx's thought, as I have done in the preceding essay. But to justify it completely one would have to analyze basic thoughts from his earliest published and unpublished manuscripts to his last writings. Nevertheless, although it is impossible in a short space to "prove" the thesis completely, it is possible to support it at least partially - by comparing the key ideas of some of his works that belong to different periods of his life and have a decisive importance for those periods.

What about considering, for example, the relationship between Marx's _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy,_ and _Capital_? This choice may seem arbitrary, but it is by no means so. The three works belong to different periods of Marx's life: the first of them was written in the 1840s, i.e., in the first decade of Marx's theoretical work; the second, in the fifties, the second decade of his work; and the third mainly in the sixties and seventies, hence in the third and fourth decades of his work. Although the writing of the first two occupied Marx for only a small portion of the decades in which they were produced, and despite the fact that he did not himself either finish or publish any of the three,[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#01) these works are representative of the periods in which they were written. Marx's letters show that he was exceptionally anxious to write them and that he regarded them as more important than many other works that he finished and published. And comparing the contents of these works with other works from the same periods, we can establish that these are works where Marx discussed fundamental problems and came to decisive conclusions, conclusions that are basic for other works from these periods.

Taking the three works as a basis for analysis has one more special justification. Those who advocate the thesis about the two different Marxes very often put forward as their main argument the alleged unbridgeable gap between the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ and _Capital_, maintaining that the first work shows the hand of Marx the abstract philosopher who solves concrete social questions by speculation, whereas in _Capital_ we have before us Marx the scientist, the economist who bases his conclusions on scrupulous empirical investigation and the mathematical elaboration of a "mountain of factual material." In disputing the thesis about the two Marxes, we cannot bypass either of the two works involved in this argument - or the third work, which is ignored because it occupies the place reserved for the alleged "gap."

The fact that Marx did not finish and publish his _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ does not mean that it consists of purely private notes not intended for publication. From Marx's preface, where he informs us that in preparing the manuscript for publication he gave up his original intention of discussing in it law, morals, politics, etc., which, he announces, he will elaborate critically in a subsequent series of pamphlets, and in a separate work endeavor "to present the interconnected whole, to show the relationships between the parts, and to provide a critique of the speculative treatment of this material,"[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#02) it is obvious that Marx wished to publish this work. That he did not realize his intention is explained by the fact that after meeting Engels at the end of August 1844 he devoted himself to the polemical work _The Holy Family_, which they planned and wrote together (although much more of it was written by Marx than by Engels). Marx did not believe that his unfinished manuscript thus lost its value and interest, and he intended to finish and publish it later, as can be seen from the fact that on February 1, 1845, he signed a contract with C.W. Leske, a publisher from Darmstadt, for a book entitled _A Critique of Politics and National Economy_. Soon after finishing _The Holy Family_, however, both he and Engels got involved in polemics again and started writing the _German Ideology_.

Marx did not cease his work on the _Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy_ for any external reasons; he did so because he was dissatisfied with what he had written. He was dissatisfied, however, not with the content but with the form, which was, according to him, affected by the liver disease that had suddenly attacked him. This is vividly testified to in his letters of that time, like the one to Lassalle of November 12, 1858, in which he complained: "In all. that I wrote, I felt in the style the taste of the liver disease. And I have a double reason not to allow this writing to be spoiled by medical causes: 1) It is the result of a fifteen-year-long investigation, hence of the best years of my life. 2) It presents scientifically for the first time an important view of social relations. Consequently I owe it to the party not to distort the matter by the kind of dull, wooden writing that is proper to a sick liver."[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#03)

In Marx's letters we also find a partial explanation of his liver complaint. The illness was caused to a considerable extent by intensive night work, which was stimulated by the economic crisis of 1857, the fourth in the series of great economic crises of the nineteenth century and the first that really assumed a world character, embracing both Europe and America and all branches of economics.

Optimistically expecting that the crisis would inflict a mortal blow on the capitalistic social order, Marx applied all his energy to work in order to round up his basic conceptions as soon as possible, at least in broad lines. "I work madly throughout whole nights, summarizing my economic studies," he writes to Engels in December 1857, "in order to have the foundations ready before the flood."[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#04)

#### III

The comparative study of the three works may at first give the impression that they agree both in the basic themes, which are economic, and in the literature on which they rely, which is also economic, but that they nevertheless differ, partly in subject matter - because the first work includes philosophical as well as economic topics - but even more in the method - because the first work is characterized by abstract philosophical reasoning and the second and third by concrete empirical analysis.

Such an assertion might seem convincing. In the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_, in addition to sections devoted to such economic phenomena as wage, profit, rent, money, we also find special sections on distinctly philosophical themes such as alienated labor and Hegel's dialectics (the editor entitled those sections "Alienated Work" and "Criticism of Hegel's Dialectics and Philosophy in General"). In the _Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy_ and in _Capital_, on the contrary, there is no chapter that is obviously devoted to a philosophical topic. The difference in method may also at first seem incontestable. _Capital_ abounds in historical information, statistical facts, and mathematical computations, whereas there are none of these in _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_.

Against the view that the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ are abstract speculations without support in empirical investigations, there is, however, Marx's statement in the preface to that work: "It is hardly necessary to assure the reader who is familiar with political economy that my conclusions are the fruit of an entirely empirical analysis based upon a careful critical study of political economy."[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#05) This statement, of course, cannot be decisive when one asks to what extent Marx's results really were reached by an empirical analysis, but it must at least be taken into account when one discusses his conscious intentions and conscious methodological approach.

And if empirical analysis, or at least the intention of empirical analysis, was not alien to the "young" Marx, perhaps philosophizing was not extraneous to the "old." Indeed, is not the abundant use of philosophical terminology in the _Sketches_ and in the _Capital_ an indication of this?

The question leads us to the main thesis of this essay: despite the fact that the three chosen works are different, they possess a basic unity, even an essential identity. First, all three represent a critique of the political economy and the economic reality of capitalism and of every class society from a viewpoint that is not purely economic but above all _philosophical_. And they all contain a theoretical foundation and a call for the realization of a truly human society in which man will no longer be alienated from himself, will no more be an economic animal, but will realize himself as a free creative being of praxis.

An external confirmation for the critical, "trans-economic" character of these works is provided by explicit statements of Marx. In the preface to the _1844 Manuscripts_ he stresses the critical nature of the work, characterizing it as one critique, which will be followed by others. And concerning the _Sketches_, Marx wrote to Lassalle: "The work that is first in question is the critique of economic categories, or, if you like, the system of bourgeois economy presented critically. This is at the same time the representation of the system and through the presentation its criticism."[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#06) The critical character of _Capital_ was stressed by Marx in the subtitle - "critique of political economy" - but also, for example, in the epilogue of the second edition (1873) where he says that he used the dialectical method in this work, and that it is "in its essence critical and revolutionary."[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#07)

Such single statements cannot be regarded as decisive confirmation of the identity of the basic position of the three works in question. The decisive confirmation is offered by the whole content of these works.

A fundamental idea of Marx's _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ is that man is a free creative being of praxis who in the contemporary world is alienated from his human essence, but that the radical form man's self-alienation assumes in the contemporary society creates real conditions for a struggle against self-alienation, for realizing socialism as a de-alienated, free community of free men. And this is also the guiding idea of the _Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy_ and of _Capital_.

#### IV

Every fragment of a great literary work expresses at least partly the meaning of the whole. Perhaps we will come closer to understanding Marx's _Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy_ if we carefully consider the following passage:

We never find in the ancients an investigation of which form of ownership of land, etc., is most productive, creates the largest wealth. Wealth does not appear as an end of production, although, of course, Cato may investigate which tillage of the ground is most remunerative, or Brutus may lend money at the best rate of interest. The investigation is always which form of ownership creates the best citizens. As an end in itself wealth appears only among a small number of commercial nations - monopolists of the carrying trade - which live in the pores of the old world like the Jews in medieval society. However, wealth is, on the one hand, a thing, it is realized in things, material products, which are confronted by man as a subject; on the other hand, as value it is a pure command over alien work, with the purpose not of domination but of private enjoyment, etc. In all forms it appears in a thing-form either as a thing, or as a relationship by means of a thing, which lies outside and accidentally beside the individual. In this way the old view, according to which man, although in a limited national, religious, political determination, appears as the end of production, seems very exalted compared with that of the modern world, where production appears as the end of man, and wealth as the end of production. But in fact, if one tears down the limited bourgeois form, what else is wealth if not universality of needs, capabilities, enjoyments, productive forces, etc., of individuals produced in a universal exchange? The full development of man's domination over natural forces, those of nature so-called as well as those of his own nature? The development of one's creative predispositions - without any other presupposition but the previous historical development that makes this totality of development, i.e., the development of all human forces as such, not measured by some _previously given_ standard - to an end in itself; where man does not reproduce himself in his definiteness but produces his totality? Where he does not endeavor to remain something become, but is in an absolute movement of becoming? In bourgeois economy - and in the epoch of production to which it corresponds - this full development of the internal in man appears as a complete emptying, this universal objectification as total alienation, and the demolition of all one-sided ends as the sacrificing of the end in itself to an entirely external end. Therefore, the childish old world on the one hand appears higher. On the other hand, it really is so in everything where a closed appearance, form, and definite limitation is required. It is satisfaction from a limited standpoint; whereas the modern world leaves man dissatisfied, or is, where it appears satisfied within itself, banal.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#08)

What is the meaning of this passage? What topics are discussed here? What is the author's approach? What are his theses?

If we consider carefully the beginning of the passage, we immediately notice the terms: "ownership of land," "most productive," "wealth," "production," "tillage of the ground," "most remunerative," "lend," "money," "interest." How many economic terms in only the first two sentences! But the rest of the passage is equally rich in economic terminology: "commercial," "work," "exchange," "productive forces," etc. Does this not show that economic themes are being discussed here? It is perhaps a too superficial way of reasoning to judge the subject matter of a text on the basis of the terms used. It is not, however, only the terms that are economic here. The main content of the passage seems to be a comparison of ancient and contemporary conceptions about the end of production. And is not production, at least in the sense in which it is used in the text, an economic category?

One may object that Marx is not speaking about production here, or even about the end of production, but about _views_ concerning the end of production. And he does not engage in general theoretical considerations about any view, but compares _ancient_ and _contemporary_ views. He does not directly discuss an economic phenomenon, nor does he here consider any phenomenon theoretically and systematically. He gives an historical comparison of two different conceptions. This objection can, however, be answered convincingly: the view of the end of production is not a "material" economic phenomenon, but it is nevertheless an _economic_ view. Thus the historical consideration of ancient and contemporary views about the end of production, although it is not a direct investigation of economic reality, is still an historical investigation of the development of _economic_ views, and consequently belongs to the sphere of economic investigations in a broad sense. It is an investigation on the borderline between economics and history.

Let us look more carefully at the question with which Marx is here concerned: in what way and what sense is he concerned with the ancient and the contemporary views about the end of production? Marx first establishes what is the immediate difference between the two views. According to the ancient view, the end of production is man; according to the contemporary, capitalist conception, the end of production is wealth, and the end of man is production. These statements can be regarded as a constituent part of a science that establishes the difference between the views of different periods by an objective investigation of historical documents.

Marx, however, does not stop at an objective registration of the difference between the ancient and the contemporary views about the end of production; he maintains that the ancient is "very exalted" compared with the modern. The main thesis of the whole passage is that the conception of man as the end of production is the "more exalted" (better, higher, more human) view. It is difficult to call this fundamental thesis "economic," because it is first concerned not with economics, but with man.

Not only is this thesis not "economic," it is not really "scientific." It might be possible to establish by scientific methods whether one of the two views was actually widespread in the ancient, and the other in the modern world. But what scientific methods can establish whether one view is more "exalted" than the other? What kind of observation, experiment, measurement, in other words, what empirical method can establish "exaltedness"?

But the fact that Marx's thesis cannot be "scientifically proved" does not make it meaningless or unsupportable. Indeed, Marx tries to persuade us of its truth. This "persuasion" begins with the sentence: "But in fact, if one tears down the limited bourgeois form, what else is wealth if not universality of needs, capabilities, enjoyments, productive forces, etc., of individuals produced in a universal exchange?"

At first this sentence may be embarrassing. Marx here seems to jump to quite another question: what wealth really is. What is even more curious, in answering the question Marx denies what he said about it in the first half of the passage, where he said that wealth is, on the one hand, a collection of material products, things, and, on the other hand, command of the work of others for the purpose of private enjoyment. Now all at once we are informed that wealth is _in fact_ something else, quite different, namely universality of needs, capabilities, enjoyments, productive forces, etc., of individuals. What do these differences and inconsistencies mean?

If we reflect a little more about Marx's text, we realize that his thought is really pretty clear and consistent: if wealth is conceived of as a collection of material things and command over the work of others, then the view that man is the end of production is "exalted" compared to the view that the end of production is wealth. But the view that the end of production is wealth need not be wrong or contrary to the view that the end of production is man, if "wealth" is interpreted in another way as:

1. "universality of needs, capabilities, enjoyments, productive forces, etc., of individuals produced in a universal exchange";  
2. "the full development of man's domination over natural forces, those of nature so-called as well as those of his own nature";  
3. "the absolute development of one's creative predispositions - without any other presupposition but the previous historical development that makes this totality of development, i.e., development of all human forces as such, not measured by some _previously given_ standard, an end in itself";  
4. such development of one's creative predispositions in which man "does not reproduce himself in his definiteness, but produces his totality";  
5. such development of one's creative predisposition in which man "does not endeavor to remain something become, but is in an absolute movement of becoming."

Thus, according to Marx, man is rich not when he possesses many things or when he successfully exploits other people, but when he universally develops his needs, capabilities, creative forces; when he does not reproduce himself in his definiteness, does not endeavor to remain what he already is, but is in the "absolute movement of becoming." Can such a view of man's wealth be regarded as an "economic" doctrine? Is it a scientific conception that can be empirically proved, or is it a philosophical thesis founded on philosophical argument?

Marx's thought in the part of the passage analyzed so far can be summarized as follows: the ancient view that the end of production is man is superior to the new, capitalist view that the end of man is production, and the end of production, wealth. If, however, wealth is conceived of not as the possession of things, but as the development of the creative human personality, the difference between the two views disappears.

The analysis of the passage is still not finished. The thesis that man's wealth lies in the universal development of his capabilities and that the end of production is the development of man might seem to be an idealization of man and his production to those who regard philosophical theses as empirical descriptions of what in fact is. That Marx was not given to idealization of man in his factual existence can be seen from the part of the passage already quoted. But in the text that follows Marx also directly warns that he is not talking of what is but of what can and ought to be, because he regards the existing world as an alienated world in which man does not realize his human nature, but something contrary to it: "In bourgeois economy - and in the epoch of production to which it corresponds - this full development of the internal in man appears as a complete emptying, this universal objectification as total alienation, and the demolition of all definite one-sided ends, as the sacrificing of the end in itself to an entirely external end."

Thus Marx testifies that he is concerned with a philosophical question and with a critical, not apologetic or neutral, attitude toward the existing world. But although he takes care to protect his thought from misinterpretation as an apology for, or embellishment of, the existing reality, Marx also warns against conceiving of it as a criticism of the contemporary world from the viewpoint of the past. Repeating, at the end of the passage, that the old world is in certain respects higher than the modern ("in everything where a closed appearance, form and definite limitation is required"), he at the same time characterizes this old world as "childish," and remarks that it is "satisfaction from a limited standpoint." This, however, does not do away with the thesis that the old world is, in a qualified sense, higher than the contemporary. The old world satisfies man from a limited standpoint; the modern world leaves him dissatisfied or satisfies him in a banal way.

#### V

It is not necessary to be an expert on the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ to know that the view that man's wealth is not the mere possession of things and domination over other men, but rather the full development of his creative potentialities, was already stated in the _1844 Manuscripts_. Nevertheless let us quote one passage:

It will be seen from this how, in place of the _wealth_ and _poverty_ of political economy, we have the _wealthy_ man and the plenitude of _human_ need. The wealthy man is at the same time one who _needs_ a complex of human manifestations of life, and whose own self-realization exists as an inner necessity, a _need_. Not only the _wealth_ but also the _poverty_ of man _acquires_, in a socialist perspective, a _human_ and thus a social meaning. Poverty is the passive bond that leads man to experience a need for the greatest wealth, the _other_ person. The sway of the objective entity within me, the sensuous outbreak of my life-activity, is the passion that here becomes the _activity_ of my being.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#09)

The two passages (this one from the _Manuscripts_ and the other from the _Sketches_) are, of course, not identical, but it is not difficult to see that the conception of man's wealth is essentially the same in both.

The ideas expressed in the _Manuscripts_ were further developed by Marx in the _Sketches_, and he did not abandon them in _Capital_. Let us consider only this passage from _Capital_:

"However terrible and disgusting, under the capitalist system, the dissolution of the old family ties may appear, nevertheless, large-scale industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic basis for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes. It is, of course, just as absurd to regard the Teutonic-Christian form of the family as absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, or the Eastern forms, which, moreover, taken together, form a series in historical development. Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of humane development, although in its spontaneously developed, brutal capitalist form, where the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the laborer, it is a pestilential source of corruption and slavery."[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/petrovic/1964/marx.htm#10)

This quotation from _Capital_ seemingly has nothing to do with the fragment from the _Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy_. A more careful comparison, however, shows interesting analogies: just as the passage from the _Sketches_ at first seemed purely economic or economico-historical, so this fragment from _Capital_ at first seems sociological or sociologico-historical. Just as in the passage from the _Sketches_ Marx seemed to idealize the ancient view about the end of production, so in the fragment from _Capital_ it may seem that Marx is extolling the old form of the family. In the first instance, however, Marx is not upholding either the ancient or the contemporary, capitalist viewpoint, but regarding past and present from the viewpoint of the future; and in the second, he characterizes as folly the absolutization of either the Christian-Germanic, the Greco-Roman or the Oriental form of the family and attempts to discover in an observed present the germs of a human future. The passage from _Capital_ is not only analogous to the one from the _Sketches_; it actually repeats its fundamental thesis, criticizing the brutal capitalistic order where "the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the laborer."

Instead of "man" he here speaks of the "laborer," but the fundamental idea about the relationship between production and the producer is the same.

This does not mean that in _Capital_ Marx only repeated the _Sketches_, and in the _Sketches_, the _Manuscripts_, so that there is nothing new in either the _Sketches_ or _Capital_. To give only one example, when in the _Sketches_ Marx says that man is really man when he "does not endeavor to remain something become, but is in the absolute movement of becoming," this is certainly one of the ways of expressing the essence of his philosophical position, which is also inherent in his other works, but which, so far as I know, is not expressed at any other place in exactly this way. The same holds for many other ideas expressed in the _Sketches_ and in _Capital_.

The passage from the Sketches was not chosen entirely at random, but it is by no means the only one that is rich in interesting and important philosophical considerations. There are many like it. But the substance is not only in single passages. This whole unfinished manuscript is full of philosophical intentions, guided by philosophical ideas, and rich in philosophical insights. Thus it is a convincing testimony of the continuity of Marx's thought and makes it easier to grasp the essential continuity of the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ and _Capital_.

**Notes**

[1] _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ was written between February and August 1844, and published nearly half a century after Marx's death in 1932 in two editions with not quite identical texts: in Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, _Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe_, Erste Abteilung, Band 3, Marx-Engels Verlag (Berlin, 1932); and also in K. Marx, _Der historische Materialismus. Die Frühschriften_, Erster Band, Herausgegeben von S. Landshut und J.P. Mayer, Alfred Kroner Verlag (Leipzig, 1932). The title under which they became familiar originates from their Soviet editors (Landshut and Mayer entitled them _Nationalökonomie und Philosophie_).

The _Sketches for the Critique of Political Economy_ were written between October 1857 and March 1858, edited and given a title by the Moscow Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, and published by the Moscow Publishing House for Literature in Foreign Languages (Verlag für Fremdsprachige Literatur) in two volumes in 1939 and 1941. Owing to the war, most of this edition perished, so that the work became accessible only after it was republished in Berlin after the war (Karl Marx, _Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie_, Rohentwurf, 1857-1858; Anhang, 1850-1859, Marx-Engels-Lenin Institut, Moskau, Dietz Verlag [Berlin, 1953]). As is well known, the title of _Capital_ [_Das Kapital: Kritik der politischen Ökonomie_], was given by Marx himself, and he succeeded in finishing and publishing the first volume of it in 1867. The second and the third volumes, however, were edited and published by Engels in 1887 and 1894.

### Part Two ‘On The Young Marx’

---

‘On the Young Marx: Theoretical Questions’ first appeared in _La Pensée_, March-April 1961.

---

#### Theoretical Questions

The periodical _Recherches Internationales_ offers us eleven studies by Marxists from abroad ‘on the Young Marx’. One article by Togliatti, already old (1954), five from the Soviet Union (three of which are by young scholars, twenty-seven to twenty-eight years old), four from the German Democratic Republic, and one from Poland. Exegesis of the Young Marx might have been thought the privilege and the cross of Western Marxists. This work and its Presentation show them that they are no longer alone in the perils and rewards of this task.[1]

Reading this interesting but uneven[2] collection has given me the opportunity to examine a number of problems, clear up certain confusions and put forward some clarifications on my own account.

Convenience of exposition is my excuse for entering on the question of Marx’s Early Works in three basic aspects: political, theoretical and philosophical.

#### The Political Problem

First of all, any discussion of Marx’s Early Works is a _political_ discussion. Need we be reminded that Marx’s Early Works, whose history and significance were well enough described by Mehring, were exhumed by Social-Democrats and exploited by them to the detriment of Marxism-Leninism? The heroic ancestors of this operation were named Landshut and Mayer (1931). The Preface to their edition may be read in Molitor’s translation in the Costès edition of Marx (_OEuvres philosophiques de Marx_, t. IV, pp. XIII LI). The position is quite clearly put. _Capital_ is an _ethical_ theory, the silent philosophy of which is openly spoken in Marx’s Early Works.[3] Thus, reduced to two propositions, is the thesis which has had such extraordinary success. And not only in France and in Italy, but also, as these articles from abroad show, in contemporary Germany and Poland. Philosophers, ideologues, theologians have all launched into a gigantic enterprise of criticism and _conversion_: let Marx be restored to his source, and let him admit at last that in him, the mature man is merely the young man in disguise. Or if he stubbornly insists on his age, let him admit the sins of his maturity, let him recognize that he sacrificed philosophy to economics, ethics to science, man to history. Let him consent to this or refuse it, his truth, everything that will survive him, everything which helps the men that we are to live and think, is contained in these few Early Works.

So these good critics leave us with but a single choice: we must admit that _Capital_ (and ‘mature Marxism’ in general) is _either an expression of the Young Marx’s philosophy_, _or its betrayal._ In either case, the established interpretation must be totally revised and we must return to the Young Marx, the Marx through whom spoke the Truth.

This is the _location_ of the discussion: the Young Marx. Really _at stake_ in it: Marxism. The _terms of the discussion:_ whether the Young Marx was already and wholly Marx.

The discussion once joined, it seems that Marxists have a choice between two parrying dispositions within the ideal order of the tactical combinatory.[4]

Very schematically, if they want to rescue Marx from the perils of his youth with which his opponents threaten them, they can _either agree that the young Marx is not Marx; or that the young Marx is Marx._ These extreme theses may be _nuanced;_ but their inspiration extends even to their nuances.

Of course, this inventory of possibilities may well seem derisory. Where disputed history is concerned, there is no place for tactics, the verdict must be sought solely in a scientific examination of the facts and documents. However, past experience, and even a reading of the present collection, proves that on occasion it may be difficult to abstract from relatively enlightened tactical considerations or defensive reactions where facing up to a _political attack_ is concerned. Jahn sees this quite clearly:[5] it was not Marxists who opened the debate on Marx’s Early Works. And no doubt because they had not grasped the true value of Mehring’s classic work or of the scholarly and scrupulous research of Auguste Cornu, young Marxists were caught out, ill-prepared for a struggle they had not foreseen. They reacted as best they could. There is some of this surprise left in the present defence, in its reflex movement, its confusion, its awkwardness. I should also add: _in its bad conscience._ For this attack surprised Marxists on their own ground: that of Marx. If it had been a question of a simple concept they might have felt themselves to have less of a special responsibility, but the problem raised was one that directly concerned Marx’s history and Marx himself. So they fell victim to a _second reaction_ which came to reinforce the first reflex defence: the fear of failing in their duty, of letting the charge entrusted to them come to harm, before themselves and before history. In plain words: if it is not studied, criticized and dominated, this reaction could lead Marxist philosophy into a ‘_catastrophic_’ _parrying movement_, a global response which in fact _suppresses_ the problem in its attempt to deal with it.

To discomfit those who set up against Marx his own youth, the _opposite position_ is resolutely taken up: Marx is reconciled with his youth – _Capital_ is no longer read as _On the Jewish Question_, _On the Jewish Question_ is read as _Capital;_ the shadow of the young Marx is no longer projected on to Marx, but that of Marx on to the young Marx; and a pseudo-theory of the history of philosophy in the ‘_future anterior_’ is erected to justify this counter-position, without realizing that this pseudo-theory is quite simply Hegelian.[6] A devout fear of a blow to Marx’s _integrity_ inspires as its reflex a resolute acceptance of _the whole of Marx:_ Marx is declared to be a whole, ‘_the young Marx is part of Marxism_’[7] – as if we risked losing the _whole of Marx_ if we were to submit his youth to the radical critique of history, not _the history he was going to live_, but _the history he did live_, not an immediate history, but the reflected history for which, in his maturity, he gave us, not the ‘_truth_’ in the Hegelian sense, but the principles of its scientific understanding.

Even where parrying is concerned, there can be no good policy without good theory.

##### The Theoretical Problem

This brings us to the _second problem_ posed by a study of Marx’s Early Works: the _theoretical_ problem. I must insist on it, as it seems to me that it has not always been resolved, or even correctly posed in the majority of studies inspired by this subject.

Indeed, only too often the form of the _reading_ of Marx’s early writings adopted depends more on free association of ideas or on a simple comparison of terms than on a historical critique.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n8) This is not to dispute that such a reading can give theoretical results, but these results are merely _the precondition_ of a real understanding of the texts. For example, Marx’s Dissertation may be read by comparing its terms with those of Hegel’s thought;[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n9) the _Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_ by comparing its principles with those of Feuerbach or those of Marx’s maturity;[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n10) the _1844 Manuscripts_ by comparing their principles with those of _Capital._[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n11) Even then, the comparison may be either superficial or profound. It may give rise to misunderstandings[12] which are errors for all that. On the other hand, it can open up interesting perspectives.[13] But such comparison is not always its own justification.

Indeed, to stick to spontaneous or even enlightened association of theoretical _elements_ is to run the risk of remaining the prisoner of an implicit conception only too close to the current academic conception of the comparison, opposition and approximation of elements that culminates in a theory of _sources_ – or, what comes to the same thing, in a theory of anticipation. A sophisticated reading of Hegel ‘thinks of Hegel’ when it reads the _1841 Dissertation_ or even the _1844 Manuscripts._ A sophisticated reading of Marx ‘thinks of Marx’ when it reads the _Critique of the Philosophy of Right._[14]

Perhaps it is not realized often enough that whether this conception is a theory of sources or a theory of anticipation, it is, in its naïve immediacy, based on _three theoretical presuppositions_ which are always tacitly active in it. The _first presupposition is analytic:_ it holds that any theoretical system and any constituted thought is _reducible to its elements:_ a precondition that enables one to think any element of this system _on its own_, and to compare it with _another_ similar element from _another_ system.[15] The _second presupposition_ is _teleological:_ it institutes a secret tribunal of history which _judges_ the ideas submitted to it, or rather, which permits the dissolution of (different) systems into their elements, institutes these elements as elements in order to proceed to their measurement according to its own norms as if to _their truth._[16] Finally, these two presuppositions depend on a _third_, which regards the history of ideas as its own element, maintains that nothing happens there which is not a product of the history of ideas itself and that the world of ideology is _its own principle of intelligibility._

I believe it is necessary to dig down to these foundations if we are to understand the possibility and meaning of this method’s most striking feature: its _eclecticism._ Where this surface eclecticism is not hiding completely meaningless forms a search beneath it will always reveal this _theoretical teleology_ and this _auto-intelligibility of ideology_ as such. When reading some of the articles in this collection, one cannot help feeling that even in their efforts to free themselves from this conception, they still remain contaminated by its implicit logic. Indeed it seems as if writing the history of Marx’s early theoretical development entailed the reduction of his thought into its ‘_elements_’, grouped in general under two rubrics: the materialist elements and the idealist elements; as if a comparison of these elements, a confrontation of the weight of each, could determine the _meaning_ of the text under examination. Thus, in the articles from the _Rheinische Zeitung_ the external form of a thought which is _still_ Hegelian can be shown to conceal the presence of _materialist elements_ such as the political nature of censorship, the social (class) nature of the laws on the theft of wood, etc.; in the 1843 Manuscript (_The Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_), the exposition and formulation, though still _inspired_ by Feuerbach or _still_ Hegelian, conceal the presence of _materialist elements_ such as the reality of social classes, of private property and its relation to the State, and even of dialectical materialism itself, etc. It is clear that this discrimination between _elements_ detached from the internal context of the thought expressed and conceived in isolation, is only possible on condition, that the reading of these texts is _slanted_, that is, _teleological._ One of the most clear-headed of the authors in this collection, N. Lapine, expressly recognizes this: ‘_This kind of characterization_ ... is, in fact, very eclectic, as it does not answer the question as to how these different elements are combined together in Marx’s world outlook.’[17] He sees clearly that this decomposition of a text into what is already materialist and what is still idealist does not preserve its unity, and that this decomposition is induced precisely by reading the early texts through the content of the mature texts. Fully developed Marxism, the Goal are the members of the tribunal which pronounces and executes this judgment, separating the body of an earlier text into its elements, thereby destroying its unity. ‘If we start with the conception Marx then had of his philosophical position, the 1843 Manuscript emerges as a perfectly consistent and complete work,’ whereas ‘from the viewpoint of developed Marxism the 1843 Manuscript does not emerge as an organically complete whole, in which the methodological value of each element has been rigorously demonstrated. An obvious lack of maturity means that an exaggerated attention is paid to certain problems, whereas others of basic importance are no more than outlined... .’[18] We could not ask for a more honest recognition that the decomposition into elements and the constitution of these elements is induced by their insertion into a finalist perspective. I might further add that a sort of ‘delegation of reference’ often occurs, which fully developed Marxism confers on an intermediate author, for example, on Feuerbach. As Feuerbach is reckoned to be a ‘materialist’ (though, strictly speaking, Feuerbach’s ‘materialism’ depends essentially on taking Feuerbach’s own declarations of materialism at their face value) he can serve as a second centre of reference, and in his turn make possible the acceptance of certain elements in Marx’s Early Works as materialist by-products, by virtue of his own pronouncement and his own ‘sincerity’. Thus the subject-predicate inversion, the Feuerbachian critique of speculative philosophy, his critique of religion, the human essence objectified in its productions, etc., are all declared to be ‘materialist’... . This ‘by-production’ of elements via Feuerbach combined with the production of elements via the mature Marx occasionally gives rise to strange redundancies and misunderstandings; for example, when it is a matter of deciding just what does distinguish the materialist elements authenticated by Feuerbach from the materialist elements authenticated by Marx himself.[19] Ultimately, as this procedure enables us to find _materialist elements_ in all Marx’s early texts, including even the letter to his father in which he refuses to separate the ideal from the real, it is very difficult to decide _when_ Marx can be regarded as materialist, or rather, when he could not have been! For _Jahn_, for example, although they ‘_still_’ contain ‘_a whole series of abstract elements_’ the _1844 Manuscripts_ mark ‘_the birth of scientific socialism_’.[20] For _Pajitnov_, these manuscripts ‘_form the crucial pivot around which Marx reoriented the social sciences. The theoretical premises of Marxism had been laid down_.’[21] For _Lapine_, ‘_unlike the articles in the_ Rheinische Zeitung _in which certain elements of materialism only appear spontaneously_, _the_ 1843 Manuscript _witnesses to Marx’s conscious passage to materialism_’, and in fact ‘_Marx’s critique of Hegel starts from materialist positions_’ (it is true that this ‘_conscious passage_’ is called ‘_implicit_’ and ‘_unconscious_’ in the same article).[22] As for Schaff, he writes squarely ‘_We know_ (_from later statements of Engels_) _that Marx became a materialist in 1841_’.[23]

I am not trying to make an easy argument out of these contradictions (which might at little cost be set aside as signs of an ‘open’ investigation). But it is legitimate to ask whether this uncertainty about the moment when Marx _passed on_ to materialism, etc., is not related to the spontaneous and implicit use of an analytico-teleological theory. We cannot but notice that this theory seems to have no valid criterion whereby it could pronounce upon the body of thought it has decomposed into its elements, that is, whose effective unity it has destroyed. And this lack arises precisely because this very decomposition deprives it of such a criterion: in fact, if an idealist element is an idealist element and a materialist element is a materialist element, who can really decide what meaning they constitute once they are assembled together in _the effective living unity of a text?_ Ultimately, the paradoxical result of this decomposition is that even the question of _the global meaning of a text_ such as _On the Jewish Question_ or the 1843 Manuscript _vanishes_, _it is not asked_ because the means whereby it might have been asked have been rejected. But this is a question of the highest importance that neither real life nor a living critique can ever avoid! Suppose by chance that a reader of our own time came to take seriously the philosophy of _On the Jewish Question_ or of the _1844 Manuscripts_, and espoused it (it has happened! I was about to say, it has happened to us all! and how many of those to whom it has happened have _failed_ to become Marxists!). Just what, I wonder, could we then say about his thought, considered as what it is, that is, as a whole. Would we regard it as idealist or materialist? Marxist or non-Marxist?[24] Or should we regard its meaning as _in abeyance_, waiting on a stage it has not yet reached? But this is the way Marx’s early texts are only too often treated, as if they belonged to a reserved domain, sheltered from the ‘_basic question_’ solely because they _must_ develop into Marxism... . As if their meaning had been held in abeyance until the end, as if it was necessary to wait on the final synthesis before their elements could be at last resorbed _into a whole_, as if, before this final synthesis, the question of the whole could not be raised, just because all totalities earlier than the final synthesis have been destroyed? But this brings us to the height of the paradox from behind which this analytico-teleological method breaks out: this method which is constantly _judging_ cannot _make the slightest judgment of any totality unlike itself._ Could there be a franker admission that it merely _judges itself_, _recognizes itself behind the objects if considers_, that it _never moves outside itself_, that the development it hopes to think it cannot definitively think other than as _a development of itself within itself?_ And to anyone whose response to the ultimate logic that I have drawn from this method is to say ‘_that is precisely what makes it dialectical_’ _–_ my answer is ‘_Dialectical_, _yes_, _but Hegelian!_’

In fact, once it is a matter of thinking precisely the _development_ of a thought which has been reduced to its elements in this way, once Lapine’s naïve but honest question has been asked: ‘_how are these different elements combined together in Marx’s final world outlook?_’, once it is a matter of conceiving the relations between these elements whose destiny we know, the arguments we can see emerging are those of the Hegelian dialectic, in superficial or profound forms. An example of the superficial form is a recourse to the contradiction between form and content, or more precisely, between content and its _conceptual expression._ The ‘materialist content’ comes into contradiction with its ‘idealist form’, and the idealist form itself tends to be reduced to a mere matter of _terminology_ (it had to dissolve in the end; it was nothing but _words_). Marx was _already_ a materialist, but he was _still_ using Feuerbachian concepts, he was borrowing Feuerbachian _terminology_ although he was no longer and had never been a pure Feuerbachian: between the _1844 Manuscripts_ and the Mature Works Marx discovered his definitive terminology;[25] it is merely a question of _language._ The whole development occurred in the words. I know this is to schematize, but it makes it easier to see the hidden meaning of the procedure. It can on occasion be considerably elaborated, for example, in _Lapine’s_ theory which, not content with opposing form (terminology) and content, opposes _consciousness_ and _tendency._ Lapine does not reduce the differences between Marx’s thought at different times to a mere difference of terminology. He admits that _the language had a meaning:_ this meaning was that of Marx’s consciousness (of himself) at a particular moment in his development. Thus, in the 1843 Manuscript (_The Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_) Marx’s self-consciousness was Feuerbachian. Marx spoke the language of Feuerbach because _he believed himself_ to be a Feuerbachian. But this language-consciousness was objectively in contradiction with his ‘_materialist tendency_’. It is this contradiction which constitutes the motor of his development. This conception may well be Marxist in appearance (cf. the ‘delay of consciousness’), but only in appearance, for if it is possible within it to define the _consciousness_ of a text (its global meaning, its language-meaning), it is hard to see how concretely to define its ‘_tendency_’. Or, rather, it is perfectly clear how it has been defined once we realize that, for Lapine, the distinction between materialist tendency and consciousness (of self) coincides exactly with ‘_the difference between the appearance of the objective content of the_ 1843 Manuscript _from the viewpoint of developed Marxism and what Marx himself regarded as the content at the time_’.[26] Rigorously understood, this sentence suggests that the ‘_tendency_’ is nothing but a retrospective abstraction of the _result_, which was precisely what had to be explained, that is, it is the Hegelian _in-itself_ conceived on the basis of its end as its real origin. The contradiction between consciousness and tendency can thus be reduced to the contradiction between the in-itself and the for-itself. Lapine immediately goes on to say that this tendency is ‘implicit’ and ‘unconscious’. We are given _an abstraction from the problem itself as if it were the solution._ Naturally, I am not denying that in Lapine’s essay there are not indications of a way to a _different_ conception (now I shall be accused of lapsing into the theory of elements! The very concept of ‘tendency’ must be renounced if it is to be really possible to think these elements), but it must be admitted that his systematics is Hegelian.

It is not possible to commit oneself to a Marxist study of Marx’s Early Works (and of the problems they pose) without rejecting the spontaneous or reflected temptations of an analytico-teleological method which is always more or less haunted by _Hegelian principles._ It is essential to break with the presuppositions of this method, and to apply the Marxist principles of a theory of ideological development to our object.

These principles are quite different from those hitherto considered. They imply:

(1) Every ideology must be regarded as a real whole, internally unified by its own _problematic_, so that it is impossible to extract one element without altering its meaning.

(2) The meaning of this whole, of a particular ideology (in this case an individual’s thought), depends not on its relation to a _truth_ other than itself but on its relation to the existing _ideological field_ and on the _social problems and social structure_ which sustain the ideology and are reflected in it; the sense of the _development_ of a particular ideology depends not on the relation of this development to its origins or its end, considered as _its truth_, but to the relation found within this development between the mutations of the particular ideology and the mutations in the ideological field and the social problems and relations that sustain it.

(3) Therefore, the developmental motor principle of a particular ideology cannot be found within ideology itself but outside it, in what _underlies_ (_l’en-deça de_) the particular ideology: its author as a concrete individual and the actual history reflected in this individual development according to the complex ties between the individual and this history.

I should add that these principles, unlike the previous ones, are not _in the strict sense ideological principles_, _but scientific ones_: in other words, they are not _the truth_ of the process to be studied (as are all the principles of a history in the ‘future anterior’). They are not _the truth of_, they are the _truth for_, they are _true_ as a precondition to legitimately posing a problem, and thus through this problem, to the production of a true solution. So these principles too presuppose ‘fully developed Marxism’, but not as the _truth_ of its own genesis, rather, as _the theory which makes possible an understanding_ of its own genesis as of any other historical process. Anyway, this is the absolute precondition if Marxism is to explain _other things than itself_: not only its own genesis as something different from itself, but also all the other transformations produced in history _including_ those marked by the practical consequences of the intervention of Marxism in history. If it is not the _truth of_ in the Hegelian and Feuerbachian sense, but a discipline of scientific investigation, Marxism need be no more embarrassed by its own genesis than by the historical movement it has marked by its intervention: where Marx came from, as well as what comes from Marx must, if they are to be understood, _both_ suffer the application of Marxist _principles_ of investigation.[[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n27)

If the problem of Marx’s Early Works is really to be posed, the first condition to fulfil is to admit that _even philosophers_ are young men for a time. They must be born somewhere, some time, and begin to think and write. The scholar who insisted that his early works should never be published, or even written (for there is bound to be at least some doctoral candidate to publish them!) was certainly no Hegelian ... for from the Hegelian viewpoint, Early Works are as inevitable and as impossible as the singular object displayed by Jarry: ‘_the skull of the child Voltaire_’. They are as inevitable as all beginnings. They are impossible because _it is impossible to choose one’s beginnings._ Marx did not choose to be born to the thought German history had concentrated in its university education, nor to think its ideological world. He grew up in this world, in it he learned to live and move, with it he ‘settled accounts’, from it he liberated himself. I shall return to _the necessity and contingency of this beginning_ later. The fact is that there was a _beginning_, and that to work out the history of Marx’s particular thoughts their movement must be grasped at the precise instant when that concrete individual the Young Marx emerged into the _thought world_ of his own time, to _think in it_ in his turn, and to enter into the exchange and debate with the thoughts of his time which was to be his whole life as an ideologue. At this level of the exchanges and conflicts that are the very substance of the _texts_ in which his living thoughts have come down to us, it is as if the authors of these thoughts were themselves _absent._ The concrete individual who expresses himself in his thoughts and his writings is absent, so is the actual history expressed in the existing ideological field. As the author effaces himself in the presence of his published thoughts, reducing himself to their rigour, so concrete history effaces itself in the presence of its ideological themes, reducing itself to their system. This double absence will also have to be put to the test. But for the moment, everything is in play between the rigour of a single thought and the thematic system of an ideological field. Their relation is this _beginning_ and _this_ beginning has no end. This is the relationship that has to be thought: the relation between the (internal) unity of a single thought (at each moment of its development) and the existing ideological field (at each moment of its development). But if this relationship is to be thought, so, in the same movement, must its terms.

This methodological demand immediately implies _an effective knowledge_ of the substance and structure of this basic ideological field, and not just an allusive knowledge. It implies that as neutral a representation of the ideological world as that of a stage, on which characters as famous as they are non-existent make chance encounters, will not do. Marx’s fate in the years from 1840 to 1845 was not decided by an ideal debate between characters called Hegel, Feuerbach, Stirner, Hess, etc. Nor was it decided by the same Hegel, Feuerbach, Stirner and Hess as they appeared in Marx’s own works at the time. Even less by later evocations of great generality by Engels and Lenin. It was decided by _concrete_ ideological characters on whom the ideological context imposed _determinate features_ which do not necessarily coincide with their literal historical identities (e.g. Hegel), which are much more extensive than the explicit representations Marx gave of them in these same writings, quoting, invoking and criticizing them (e.g. Feuerbach), and, of course, the general characteristics outlined by Engels forty years later. As a concrete illustration of these remarks, the Hegel who was the opponent of the Young Marx from the time of his doctoral dissertation was not the library Hegel we can meditate on in the solitude of 1960; it was _the Hegel of the neo-Hegelian movement_, a Hegel already summoned to provide German intellectuals of the 1840s with the means to think their own history and their own hopes; a Hegel already made to contradict himself, invoked against himself, despite himself. The idea of _a philosophy transforming itself into a will_, emerging from the world of reflection to transform the political world, in which we can see Marx’s first rebellion against his master, is perfectly in accord with the interpretation dominant among the neo-Hegelians.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n28) I do not dispute the claim that in his thesis Marx already showed that acute sense of concepts, that implacably rigorous grasp and that genius of conception which were the admiration of his friends. But this idea was not his invention. In the same way, it would be very rash to reduce Feuerbach’s presence in Marx’s writings between 1841 and 1844 to explicit _references_ alone. For many passages directly reproduce or paraphrase Feuerbachian arguments without his name ever being mentioned. The passage Togliatti extracted from the _1844 Manuscripts_ comes straight from Feuerbach; many others could be invoked which have been too hastily attributed to Marx. Why should Marx have referred to Feuerbach when everyone knew his work, and above all, when _he had appreciated Feuerbach’s thought_ and was thinking in his thoughts as if they were his own? But as we shall see in a moment, we must go further than the unmentioned presence of the thoughts of a living author to the presence of his _potential thoughts_, to his _problematic_, that is, to the constitutive unity of the effective thoughts that make up the domain of the existing _ideological field_ with which a particular author must settle accounts in his own thought. It is immediately obvious that if it is impossible to think the unity of an individual’s thought while ignoring its ideological field, if this field is itself to be thought it requires the thought of this _unity._

So what is this unity? Let us return to Feuerbach for an illustration whereby we can answer this question, but this time to pose the problem of the internal unity of Marx’s thought when _the two were related._ Most of the commentators in our collection are manifestly troubled by the nature of this relation, and it gives rise to many conflicting interpretations. This embarrassment is not merely the result of a lack of familiarity with Feuerbach’s writings (they can be read). It arises because they do not succeed in conceiving what it is that constitutes the basic unity of a text, the internal essence of an ideological thought, that is, its _problematic._ I put this term forward – Marx never directly used it, but it constantly animates the ideological analyses of his maturity (particularly _The German Ideology_)[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n29) – because it is the concept that gives the best _grasp_ on the facts without falling into the Hegelian ambiguities of ‘_totality_’. Indeed, to say that an ideology constitutes an (organic) totality is only valid _descriptively_ – not _theoretically_, for this description converted into a theory exposes us to the danger of thinking nothing but the empty unity of the described whole, not a _determinate unitary structure._ On the contrary, to think the unity of a determinate ideological unity (which presents itself explicitly as a whole, and which is explicitly or implicitly ‘lived’ as a whole or as an intention of ‘totalization’) by means of the concept of its _problematic_ is to allow the _typical systematic structure_ unifying all the elements of the thought to be brought to light, and therefore to discover in this unity a _determinate content_ which makes it possible both to conceive the _meaning_ of the ‘elements’ of the ideology concerned – _and to relate this ideology to the problems left or posed to every thinker by the historical period in which he lives._[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n30)

Take a specific example: Marx’s _1843 Manuscript_ (_The Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_). According to the commentators this contains a series of Feuerbachian themes (the subject-predicate inversion, the critique of speculative philosophy, the theory of the species-man, etc.), but also some analyses which are not to be found in Feuerbach (the interrelation of politics, the State and private property, the reality of social classes, etc.). To remain at the level of _elements_ would be to fall into the impasse of the analytico-teleological critique we discussed above, and into its pseudo-solution: terminology and meaning, tendency and consciousness, etc. We must go further and ask whether the presence in Marx of analyses and _objects_ about which Feuerbach says little or nothing is a sufficient justification for this division into Feuerbachian and non-Feuerbachian (that is, already Marxist) elements. But no answer can be hoped for from _the elements themselves._ For the object discussed does not directly qualify the thought. The many authors who talked of social classes or even of the class struggle before Marx have never to my knowledge been taken for Marxists simply because they dealt with objects which were eventually destined to attract Marx’s attention. It is not the material reflected on that characterizes and qualifies a reflection, but, at this level the _modality of the reflection_,[31] the actual relation the reflection has with its objects, that is, the _basic problematic_ that is the starting point for the reflection of the objects of the thought. This is not to say that the material reflected may not _under certain conditions_ modify the modality of the reflection, but that is another question (to which we shall return), and in any case, this modification in the modality of a reflection, this restructuration of the problematic of an ideology can proceed by many other routes than that of the simple immediate relation of object and reflection! So anyone who still wants to pose the problem of elements in this perspective must recognize that everything depends on a question which must have priority over them: the question of _the nature of the problematic which is the starting-point for actually thinking them_, in a given text. In our example, the question takes the following form: in the _Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_, has Marx’s reflection on his new objects, social class, the private property/State relation, etc., swept aside Feuerbach’s theoretical presuppositions, has it reduced them to the level of mere phrases? Or are these new objects thought from the starting-point of _the same presuppositions?_ This question is possible precisely because the _problematic_ of a thought is not limited to the domain of the objects considered by its author, because it is not an abstraction for the thought as a totality, but the concrete determinate structure of a thought and of all the thoughts possible within this thought. Thus Feuerbach’s anthropology can become the problematic not only of religion (_The Essence of Christianity_), but also of politics (_On the Jewish Question_, the 1843 Manuscript), or even of history and economics (the _1844 Manuscripts_) without ceasing to be in essentials an _anthropological problematic_, even if the ‘letter’ of Feuerbach is itself abandoned or superseded.[32] It is, of course, possible to regard it as politically important to have moved from a religious anthropology to a political anthropology, and finally to an economic anthropology, and I would agree completely that in Germany in 1843 anthropology represented an advanced ideological form. But to make this judgment presupposes that the nature of the ideology under consideration is already familiar, that is, that its _effective problematic_ has been defined.

I should add that if it is not so much the immediate content of the objects reflected as the way the problems are posed which constitutes the ultimate ideological essence of an ideology, this problematic is not of itself immediately present to the historian’s reflection, for good reason: in general a philosopher _thinks in it rather than thinking of it_, and his ‘order of reasons’ does not coincide with the ‘order of reasons’ of his philosophy. An ideology (in the strict Marxist sense of the term – the sense in which Marxism is not itself an ideology) can be regarded as characterized in this particular respect by the fact that _its own problematic is not conscious of itself._ When Marx tells us (and he continually repeats it) not to take an ideology’s consciousness of itself for its essence, he also means that before it is unconscious of the real problems it is a response (or non-response) to, an ideology is already unconscious of its ‘theoretical presuppositions’, that is, the active but unavowed problematic which fixes for it the meaning and movement of _its problems_ and thereby of their solutions. So a problematic cannot generally be read like an open book, it must be dragged up from the depths of the ideology in which it is buried but active, and usually despite the ideology itself, its own statements and proclamations. Anyone who is prepared to go this far will, I imagine, feel obliged to stop confusing the _materialist proclamations_ of certain ‘materialists’ (above all Feuerbach) with _materialism itself._ There is much to suggest that this would clarify some problems and dissipate some other, false, problems. Marxism would thereby gain an ever more exact consciousness of its own problematic, that is, of itself, and even in its historical works – which, after all, is its due, and, if I may say so, its duty.

Let me summarize these reflections. Understanding an ideological argument implies, at the level of the ideology itself, simultaneous, conjoint knowledge of the _ideological field_ in which a thought emerges and grows; and the exposure of the internal unity of this thought: its _problematic._ Knowledge of the ideological field itself presupposes knowledge of the problematics compounded or opposed in it. This interrelation of the particular problematic of the thought of the individual under consideration with the particular problematics of the thoughts belonging to the ideological field allows of a decision as to its author’s specific difference, i.e, _whether a new meaning has emerged._ Of course, this complex process is all haunted by real history. But everything cannot be said at once.

It is now clear that this method, breaking directly with the first theoretical presupposition of eclectic criticism, has already[33] detached itself from the illusions of the second presupposition, the silent tribunal over ideological history whose values and verdicts are decided even before investigation starts. The _truth_ of ideological history is neither in its principle (its source) nor in its end (its goal). It is _in the facts_ themselves, in that nodal constitution of ideological meanings, themes and objects, against the deceptive backcloth of their problematic, itself evolving against the backcloth of an ‘anchylose’ and unstable ideological world, itself in the sway of real history. Of course, we now know that the Young Marx _did_ become Marx, but we should not want to live faster than he did, we should not want to live in his place, reject for him or discover for him. We shall not be waiting for him at the end of the course to throw round him as round a runner the mantle of repose, for at last it is over, he has arrived. Rousseau remarked that with children and adolescents the whole art of education consists of knowing how to _lose time._ The art of historical criticism also consists of knowing how to lose time so that young authors can grow up. This lost time is simply the time we give them to live. We _scan_ the necessity of their lives in our understanding of its nodal points, its reversals and mutations. In this area there is perhaps no greater joy than to be able to witness in an emerging life, once the Gods of Origins and Goals have been dethroned, the birth of necessity.

##### The Historical Problem

But all this seems to leave the third presupposition of the eclectic method in the air; the presupposition that the whole of ideological history occurs within ideology. Let us take up this point.

I am afraid that, with the exception of the articles by Togliatti and Lapine and above all Hoeppner’s _very remarkable_ piece,[35] the majority of the studies offered here ignore this problem or devote only a few paragraphs to it.

But ultimately, no Marxist can avoid posing what used a few years ago to be called the problem of ‘Marx’s path’, that is, the problem of the relation between the _events_ of his thought and the one but double real history which was its true _subject._ We must fill in this double absence and reveal the real authors of these as yet subjectless thoughts: the concrete man and the real history that produced them. For without these real subjects how can we account for the emergence of a thought and its mutations?

I shall not pose the problem of Marx’s own personality here, the problem of the origin and structure of that extraordinary theoretical temperament, animated by an insatiable critical passion, an intransigent insistence on reality, and a prodigious feeling for the concrete. A study of the psychological structure of Marx’s personality and of its origins and history would certainly cast light on the _style of intervention_, _conception and investigation_ which are so striking in these Early Writings themselves. From it we would obtain, if not the root origin of his undertaking in Sartre’s sense (the author’s ‘basic project’), at least the origins of the profound and far-reaching insistence on a _grasp_ on reality, which would give a first sense to the actual continuity of Marx’s development, to what Lapine has, in part, tried to think in the term ‘tendency’. Without such a study we risk a failure to grasp what precisely it was that saved Marx from the fate of most of his contemporaries, who issued from the same environment and confronted the same ideological themes as he did, that is, the Young Hegelians. Mehring and Cornu have carried out the substance of this study and it is worth completing so that we may be able to understand how it was that the son of a Rhenish bourgeois became the theoretician and leader of the workers’ movement in the Europe of the railway epoch.

But as well as giving us _Marx’s psychology_ this study would lead us to real history, and the _direct apprehension of it by Marx himself._ I must stop here for a moment to pose the problem of the meaning of Marx’s evolution and of its ‘motor’.

When eclectic criticism is faced with the question, ‘how were Marx’s growth to maturity and change possible’, it is apt to give an answer which remains _within ideological history itself._ For example, it is said that Marx knew how to distinguish Hegel’s _method_ from his _content_, and that he proceeded to apply the former to history. Or else, that he set the Hegelian system _back on to its feet_ (a statement not without a certain humour if we recall that the Hegelian system was ‘a sphere of spheres’). Or, that Marx _extended_ Feuerbach’s materialism to history, as if a localized materialism was not rather suspect as a materialism; that Marx _applied_ the (Hegelian or Feuerbachian) theory of alienation to the world of social relations, as if this ‘application’ could change the theory’s basic meaning. Or finally, and this is the crucial point, that the old materialists were ‘_inconsistent_’ whereas Marx, on the contrary, was _consistent._ This inconsistency-consistency theory which haunts many a Marxist in ideological history is a little wonder of ideology, constructed for their personal use by the Philosophers of the Enlightenment. Feuerbach inherited and, alas, made good use of it! It deserves a short treatise all to itself, for it is the quintessence of historical idealism: it is indeed obvious that if ideas were self-reproducing, then any historical (or theoretical) aberration could only be a logical error.

Even when they do contain a certain degree of truth,[[36]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n36) taken literally these formulations remain prisoner to the illusion that the Young Marx’s evolution was fought out and decided _in the sphere of ideas_, and that it was achieved _by virtue of a reflection_ on ideas put forward by Hegel, Feuerbach, etc. It is as if there was agreement that the ideas inherited from Hegel by the young German intellectuals of 1840 _contained in themselves_, contrary to appearances, a certain tacit, veiled, masked, refracted truth which Marx’s critical abilities finally succeeded in tearing from them, and forcing them to admit and recognize, after years of intellectual effort. This is the basic logic implied by the famous theme of the ‘inversion’, the ‘setting back on to its feet’ of the Hegelian philosophy (dialectic), for if it were really a matter _merely of an inversion_, a restoration of what had been upside down, it is clear that to turn an object right round changes neither its nature nor its content by virtue merely of a rotation! A man on his head is the same man when he is finally walking on his feet. And a philosophy inverted in this way cannot be regarded as _anything more_ than the philosophy _reversed_ except in theoretical metaphor: in fact, its structure, its problems and the meaning of these problems are still haunted by the _same problematic._[[37]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n37) This is the logic that most often _seems_ to be at work in the Young Marx’s writings and which is most apt to be attributed to him.

Whatever the status of this view, I do not believe that it corresponds to reality. Naturally, no reader of Marx’s Early Works could remain insensible to the gigantic effort of theoretical criticism which Marx made on all the ideas he came across. Rare are the authors who have possessed so many virtues (acuity, perseverance, rigour) in the treatment of ideas. For Marx, the latter were concrete objects which he interrogated as the physicist does the objects of his experiments, to draw from them a little of the truth, of their truth. See his treatment of the idea of censorship in his article on the Prussian Censorship, or the apparently insignificant difference between green and dead wood in his article on the Theft of Wood, or the ideas of the freedom of the press, of private property, of alienation, etc. The reader cannot resist the transparency of this reflective rigour and logical strength in Marx’s early writings. And this transparency quite naturally inclines him to believe that _the logic of Marx’s intelligence coincides with the logic of his reflection_, and that he did draw from the ideological world he was working on a _truth it really contained._ And this conviction is further reinforced by Marx’s own conviction, the conviction that shines through all his efforts and even through his enthusiasms, in short, by his _consciousness._

So I will go so far as to say that it is not only essential to avoid the spontaneous illusions of the idealist conception of ideological history, but also, and perhaps even more, it is essential to avoid any concession to the impression made on us by the Young Marx’s writings and any _acceptance of his own consciousness of himself._ But to understand this it is necessary to go on to speak of real history, that is, _to question_ ‘_Marx’s path’ itself._

With this I have returned to the _beginning._ Yes, we all have to be born some day, somewhere, and begin thinking and writing in a given world. For a thinker, this world is immediately the world of the living thoughts of his time, the ideological world where he is born into thought. For Marx, this world was the world of the German ideology of the 1830s and 1840s, dominated by the problems of German idealism, and by what has been given the abstract name of the ‘decomposition of Hegel’. It was not _any world_, of course, but this general truth is not enough. For the world of the German ideology was then _without any possible comparison the world that was worst crushed beneath its ideology_ (in the strict sense), that is, the world farthest from the actual realities of history, _the most mystified_, _the most alienated world that then existed_ in a Europe of ideologies. This was the world into which Marx was born and took up thought. _The contingency of Marx’s beginnings was this enormous layer of ideology_ beneath which he was born, _this crushing layer_ which he succeeded in breaking through. Precisely because he _did_ deliver himself, we tend too easily to believe that the freedom he achieved at the cost of such prodigious efforts and decisive encounters was already inscribed in this world, and that the only problem was to _reflect._ We tend too easily to project Marx’s later consciousness on to this epoch and, as has been said, to write this history in the ‘future anterior’, when it is not a matter of projecting a consciousness of self on to another consciousness of self, but of applying to the content of an enslaved consciousness the scientific principles of historical intelligibility (not the content of another consciousness of self) later acquired by a liberated consciousness.

In his later works, Marx showed why this prodigious layer of ideology was characteristic of Germany rather than of France or England: for the _two reasons_ of the _historical backwardness of Germany_ (in economics and politics) and the state of the _social classes_ corresponding to this backwardness. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Germany emerged from the gigantic upheaval of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars deeply marked by its historical inability either to realize _national unity or bourgeois revolution._ And this ‘fatality’ was to dominate the history of Germany throughout the nineteenth century and even to be felt distantly much later. This situation whose origins can be traced back to the period of the Peasants’ War, made Germany both object and spectator of the real history which was going on around it. It was this German inability that _constituted_ and deeply _marked_ the German ideology which was formed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It was this inability which obliged German intellectuals to ‘_think what the others had done_’ and to think it in precisely the conditions implied by their inability: in the hopeful, nostalgic, idealized forms characteristic of the aspirations of their social circle: the petty bourgeoisie of functionaries, teachers, writers, etc. – and with the immediate _objects_ of their own servitude as starting-point: in particular, _religion._ The result of this set of historical conditions and demands was precisely a prodigious development of the ‘_German idealist philosophy’ whereby German intellectuals thought their conditions_, _their hopes and even their_ ‘_activity_’.

It was not the attraction of a witty turn of phrase that led Marx to declare that the French have political minds, the English economic minds, while the Germans have _theoretical_ minds. The counterpart to Germany’s _historical underdevelopment_ was an _ideological and theoretical_ ‘_over-development_’ incomparable with anything offered by other European nations. But the crucial point is that this theoretical development was an _alienated ideological_ development, without concrete relation to the real problems and the real objects which were _reflected in it._ From the viewpoint we have adopted, that is Hegel’s tragedy. His philosophy was truly the encyclopaedia of the eighteenth century, the sum of all knowledge then acquired, and even of history. But all the objects of its reflection have been ‘assimilated’ in their reflection, that is, by the particular form of ideological reflection which was the tyrant of all Germany’s intelligence. So it is easy to imagine what could be and what had to be the basic precondition for the liberation of a German youth who started to think between 1830 and 1840 in Germany itself. This precondition was the rediscovery of real history, of real objects, beyond the enormous layer of ideology which had hemmed them in and deformed them, not being content with reducing them to their shades. Hence the paradoxical conclusion: to free himself from this ideology, Marx was inevitably obliged to realize that Germany’s _ideological overdevelopment_ was at the same time in fact an expression of her _historical underdevelopment_, and that therefore it was necessary to retreat _from_ this ideological flight forwards in order to reach the things themselves, to touch real history and at last come face to face with the beings that haunted the mists of German consciousness.[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n38) Without this _retreat_, the story of the Young Marx’s liberation is incomprehensible; without this _retreat_, Marx’s relation to the German ideology, and in particular to Hegel, is incomprehensible; without this _return to real history_ (which was also to a certain extent a retreat) the Young Marx’s relation to the labour movement remains a mystery.

I have deliberately stressed this ‘_retreat_’. The too frequent use of formulae such as the ‘supersession’ of Hegel, Feuerbach, etc., tends to suggest some _continuous_ pattern of development, or at least a development whose discontinuities themselves should be thought (precisely along the lines of a Hegelian dialectic of ‘_Aufhebung_’) within the same _element of continuity_ sustained by the _temporality_ of history itself (the story of Marx and his time); whereas the critique of this ideological element implies largely a return to the authentic objects which are (logically and historically) prior to the ideology which has reflected them and hemmed them in.

Let me illustrate this formula of the _retreat_ by two examples.

The first concerns those authors whose substance Hegel ‘assimilated’, among them the English economists and the French philosophers and politicians, and the historical events whose meaning they interpreted: above all, the French Revolution. When, in 1843, Marx sat down and read the English economists, when he took up the study of Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Diderot, etc., when he studied concretely the history of the French Revolution,[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n39) it was not just a return to Hegel’s sources to verify Hegel by his sources: on the contrary, it was to _discover_ the reality of the objects Hegel had stolen by imposing on them the meaning of his own ideology. To a very great extent, Marx’s return to the theoretical products of the English and French eighteenth century was a real _return to the pre-Hegelian_, to the _objects themselves_ in their reality. The ‘supersession’ of Hegel _was not at all an_ ‘_Aufhebung’ in the Hegelian sense_, that is, an exposition of _the truth of_ what is contained in Hegel; _it was not a supersession of error towards its truth_, _on the contrary_, _it was a supersession of illusion towards its truth_, _or better_, _rather than a ‘supersession’ of illusion towards truth it was a dissipation of illusion and a retreat from the dissipated illusion back towards reality:_ the term ‘supersession’ is thus robbed of all meaning.[[40]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n40) Marx never disavowed this his decisive experience of the _direct discovery_ of reality via those who had _lived_ it directly and _thought it with the least possible deformation:_ the English economists (they had economic heads because _there was_ an economy in England!) and the French philosophers and politicians (they had political heads because _there was_ politics in France!) of the eighteenth century. And, as his critique of French utilitarianism, precisely for its lack of the advantage of direct experience,[41] shows, he was extremely sensitive to the ideological ‘distanciation’ produced by this absence: the French utilitarians made a ‘philosophical’ theory out of the economic relation of utilization and exploitation whose _actual mechanism_ was described by the English economists as they saw it in action in English reality. I feel that the problem of the relation between Marx and Hegel will remain insoluble until we take this readjustment (_décalage_) of viewpoint seriously, and realize that this _retreat_ established Marx in a domain and a terrain which were no longer Hegel’s domain and terrain.

What were the meanings of Marx’s loans from Hegel, of his Hegelian heritage and in particular of the dialectic, are questions that can only be asked from the vantage point of this ‘_change of elements_’.[42]

My second example: In their arguments within the Hegel they had constructed to answer to their needs, the Young Hegelians constantly asked the questions _which were in fact posed them by the backwardness of the German history of the day_ when they compared it with that of France and England. The Napoleonic defeat had not indeed greatly altered the historical dislocation (_décalage_) between Germany and the great nations of Western Europe. The German intellectuals of the 1830s and 1840s looked to France and England as the lands of freedom and reason, particularly after the July Revolution and the English Reform Act of 1832. Once again, unable to live it, they thought what others had done. But as they thought it in the element of philosophy, the French constitution and the English Reform became for them the reign of Reason, and they therefore awaited the German liberal revolution primarily from Reason.[[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n43) When the failure of 1840 revealed the impotence of (German) Reason alone, they looked for aid from outside; and they came up with the incredibly naïve yet moving theme, the theme which was simply an admission of their backwardness and their illusions, but an admission still within those illusions, that _the future belonged to the mystical union of France and Germany_, _the union of French political sense and German theory._[[44]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n44) Thus they were haunted by realities which they could only perceive through their own _ideological schema_, their _own problematic_, in the deformations produced by this medium.[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n45)

And when, in 1843, Marx was disillusioned by his failure to teach the Germans Reason and Freedom and he decided at last to _leave for France_, he still went largely _in search of a myth_, just as a few years ago it was still possible for the majority of the students of colonial subject nations to leave home in search of their myth in France.[46] But when he got there, he made the fundamental _discovery_ that _France and England did not correspond to their myth_, the discovery of the class struggle, of flesh and blood capitalism, and of the organized proletariat. Thus an extraordinary division of labour led to Marx discovering the reality of France while Engels did the same for England. Once again we must use the term _retreat_ (not ‘supersession’), that is, the retreat from _myth to reality_, when we are dealing with the _actual experience_ which tore off the veils of illusion behind which Marx and Engels had been living as a result of their _beginnings._

But this retreat from ideology towards reality came to coincide with the discovery _of a radically new reality_ of which Marx and Engels could find _no echo in the writings of_ ‘_German philosophy_’. In France, Marx _discovered_ the _organized working class_, in England, Engels discovered _developed capitalism_ and _a class struggle obeying its own laws and ignoring philosophy and philosophers._[47]

This double discovery played a decisive part in the Young Marx’s intellectual evolution: the discovery beneath (_en-deça_) the ideology which had deformed it of _the reality it referred to_ – and the discovery beyond contemporary ideology, _which knew it not_, of _a new reality._ Marx became himself by thinking this double reality in a rigorous theory, by changing elements – and by thinking the unity and reality of this new element. Of course, it should be understood that these discoveries are inseparable from Marx’s total personal experience, which was itself inseparable from the German history which he directly lived. For _something was happening in Germany none the less._ Events there were not just feeble echoes of events abroad. The idea that everything happened outside and nothing inside was itself an illusion of despair and impotence: for a history that fails, makes no headway and repeats itself is, as we know only too well, still a history. The whole theoretical and practical experience I have been discussing was in fact bound up with the progressive experimental discovery of German reality itself. The disappointment of 1840 which broke down the whole theoretical system behind the neo-Hegelians’ hopes, when Frederick William IV, the pseudo-’liberal’, changed into a despot – the failure of the Revolution of Reason attempted by the _Rheinische Zeitung_, persecution, Marx’s exile, abandoned by the German bourgeois elements who had supported him at first, taught him _with facts_ what was concealed by the famous ‘German misery’, the ‘philistinism’ denounced with such moral indignation, and _this moral indignation itself:_ a concrete historical situation which was no _misunderstanding_, rigid and brutal class relations, reflex exploitation and fear, stronger in the German bourgeoisie than any proof by Reason. This swept everything aside, and Marx at last discovered the reality of the ideological opacity which had blinded him; he realized that he could no longer project German myths on to foreign realities and had to recognize that these myths were meaningless not only abroad but even in Germany itself which was cradling in them its own bondage to dreams: and that on the contrary, he had to project on to Germany the light of experience acquired abroad to see it in the light of day.

I hope it is now clear that if we are truly to be able to think this dramatic genesis of Marx’s thought, it is essential to reject the term ‘_supersede_’ and turn to that of _discoveries_, to renounce the spirit of Hegelian logic implied in the innocent but sly concept of ‘supersession’ (_Aufhebung_) which is merely the empty anticipation of its end in the illusion of an immanence of truth, and to adopt instead a _logic of actual experience and real emergence_, one that would put an end to the illusions of _ideological immanence;_ in short, to adopt a logic of _the irruption of real history in ideology itself_, and thereby – as is absolutely indispensable to the Marxist perspective, and, moreover, demanded by it – give at last some real meaning to the _personal style_ of Marx’s experience, to the extraordinary sensitivity to the concrete which gave such force of conviction and revelation to each of his encounters with reality.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm#n48)

I do not propose to give a chronology or a dialectic of the _actual experience_ of history which united in that remarkable individual the Young Marx one man’s particular psychology and world history so as to produce in him the _discoveries_ which are still our nourishment today. The details should be sought in ‘_Père_’ Cornu’s works, for, with the exception of Mehring who did not have the same erudition or source material, he is the only man to have made this indispensable effort. I confidently predict that he will be read for a long time, for there is no access to the Young Marx except by way of his real history.

I merely hope that I have been able to give some idea of the extraordinary relation between the enslaved thought of the Young Marx and the free thought of Marx by pointing out some thing which is generally neglected, that is, the _contingent beginnings_ (in respect to his birth) that he had to start from and _the gigantic layer of illusions he had to break through before he could even see it._ We should realize that in a certain sense, if these beginnings are kept in mind, we cannot say absolutely that ‘_Marx’s youth is part of Marxism_’ unless we mean by this that, like all historical phenomena, the evolution of this young bourgeois intellectual can be illuminated by the application of the principles of historical materialism. Of course Marx’s youth did _lead_ to Marxism, but only at the price of a prodigious break with his origins, a heroic struggle against the illusions he had inherited from the Germany in which he was born, and an acute attention to the realities concealed by these illusions. If ‘Marx’s path’ is an example to us, it is not because of his origins and circumstances but because of his ferocious insistence on freeing himself from the myths which presented themselves to him as the _truth_, and because of the role of the experience of real history which elbowed these myths aside.

Allow me to touch on one last point. If this interpretation does make possible a better reading of the Early Works, if the deeper unity of the thought (its problematic) casts light on their theoretical elements, and the acquisitions of Marx’s actual experience (his history; his discoveries) illuminate the development of this problematic, and this makes it possible to settle those endlessly discussed problems of whether Marx was already Marx, whether he was still Feuerbachian or had gone beyond Feuerbach, that is, of the establishment at each moment of his youthful development of the internal and external meaning of the immediate elements of his thought, there is still _another question_ that it leaves unanswered, or rather introduces: the question of the _necessity of Marx’s beginnings_, from the vantage point of his _destination._

It is as if Marx’s necessity to _escape from his beginnings_, that is to traverse and dissipate the extraordinarily dense ideological world beneath which he was buried, had, as well as a _negative_ significance (escape from illusions), a significance in some sense _formative_, despite these very illusions. We might even feel that the discovery of historical materialism was ‘in the air’ and that in many respects Marx expended a prodigious theoretical effort to arrive at a reality and attain certain truths which had already in part been recognized and accepted. So there ought to have been a ‘short-cut’ to the discovery (e.g., Engels’s route via his 1844 article, or the one Marx admired in Dietzgen) as well as the ‘roundabout’ route that Marx took himself. What did he gain by this theoretical ‘_Long March_’ that his beginnings had forced on him? What profit was there in starting _so far from the end_, in sojourning so long in philosophical abstraction and in crossing such spaces on his way to reality? Probably the sharpening it gave to his critical intelligence as an individual, the acquisition of that historically incomparable ‘clinical sense’, ever vigilant for the struggles between classes and ideologies; but also, and in his contact with Hegel _par excellence_, the feeling for and practice in _abstraction_ that is indispensable to the constitution of any scientific theory, the feeling for and practice in _theoretical synthesis_ and _the logic of a process_ for which the Hegelian dialectic gave him a ‘pure’, abstract model. I have not provided these reference points because I think I can answer this question; but because they may perhaps make possible, subject to certain scientific studies in progress, a definition of what might have been the role of the German Ideology and even of German ‘speculative philosophy’ in Marx’s formation. I am inclined to see this role less as a _theoretical formation_ than as a _formation for theory_, a sort of education of the theoretical intelligence via the theoretical formations of ideology itself. As if for once, in a form foreign to its _pretensions_, the ideological over-development of the German intellect had served as a propaedeutic for the Young Marx, in two ways: both through the necessity it imposed on him to criticize his whole ideology in order to reach that point beneath (_en-deça_) his myths; and through the training it gave him in the manipulation of the abstract structure of its systems, _independently of their validity._ And if we are prepared to stand back a little from Marx’s discovery so that we can see that he founded a new scientific discipline and that this _emergence_ itself was analogous to all the great _scientific discoveries_ of history, we must also agree that no great discovery has ever been made with out bringing to light a new object or a new domain, without a new horizon of meaning appearing, a new land in which the old images and myths have been abolished – but at the same time the inventor of this new world must of absolute necessity have prepared his intelligence _in the old forms_ themselves, he must have learnt and practised them, and by criticizing them formed a taste for and learnt the art of manipulating abstract forms in general, without which familiarity he could never have conceived _new ones with which to think the new object._ In the general context of the human development which may be said to make urgent, if not inevitable, all great historical discoveries, the individual who makes himself the author of one of them is of necessity in the paradoxical situation of _having to learn the way of saying what he is going to discover in the very way he must forget._ Perhaps, too, it is this situation which gives Marx’s Early Works that tragic imminence and permanence, that extreme tension between a beginning and an end, between a language and a meaning, out of which no philosophy could come without forgetting that the destiny they are committed to is irreversible.

### Notes

---

1. The interest shown in the study of Marx’s Early Works by young Soviet scholars is particularly noteworthy, It is an important sign of the present direction of cultural development in the U.S.S.R. (cf. the ‘Presentation’, p. 4, n. 7).

2. Incontestably dominated by the remarkable essay by Hoeppner: ‘_A propos de quelques conceptions erronées du passage de Hegel à Marx_’ (pp. 175-90).

3. See Molitor, trans., (_OEuvres philosophiques de Marx_, Ed. Costès, Vol. IV, ‘Introduction’ by Landshut and Mayer: ‘It is clear that the basis for the tendency which presided over the analysis made in _Capital_ is ... the tacit hypothesis that can alone restore an intrinsic justification to the whole tendency of Marx’s most important work ... these hypotheses were precisely the formal theme of Marx’s work before 1847. For the author of _Capital_ they by no means represent youthful errors from which he progressively liberated himself as his knowledge matured, and which were cast aside as waste in the process of his personal purification. Rather, in the works from 1840 to 1847 Marx opened up the whole horizon of historical conditions and made safe the general humane foundation without which any explanation of economic relations would remain merely the work of a good economist. Anyone who fails to grasp this hidden thread which is the subject-matter of his early work and which runs through his works as a whole will be unable to understand Marx ... the principles of his economic analysis are directly derived from “the true reality of man"’ (pp. XV-XVII). ‘A slight alteration in the first sentence of the _Communist Manifesto_ would give us: “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of the self-alienation of man ..."’ (p. XLII), etc. Pajitnov’s article, ‘_Les Manuscrits de 1844_’ (_Recherches_, pp. 80-96) is a valuable review of the main authors of this ‘Young-Marxist’ revisionist current.

4. Obviously, they could calmly adopt their opponents’ theses (without realizing it) and rethink Marx through his youth – and this paradox has been tried, in France itself. But ultimately history always dissipates misunderstandings.

5. W. Jahn, ‘Le contenu économique de l’aliénation’ (Recherches, p. 158).

6. Cf. Schaff: ‘_Le vrai visage du jeune Marx_’ (_Recherches_, p. 193) and also the following extract from the Presentation (pp. 7-8): ‘Marx’s work as a whole cannot be seriously understood, nor Marxism itself as thought and as action, on the basis of the conception of his early works he happened to have when he was working them out. Only the opposite approach is valuable, that is, the approach which understands the significance and appreciates the value of these first fruits (?) and enters those creative laboratories of Marxist thought represented by writings such as the Kreuznach notebooks and the _1844 Manuscripts_ via Marxism as we have inherited it from Marx and also – it must be plainly stated – as it has been enriched by a century in the heat of historical practice. In default of this there is nothing to prevent an evaluation of Marx by criteria taken from Hegelianism if not from Thomism. _The history of philosophy is written in the future anterior: ultimately_, _a refusal to admit this is a denial of this history and the erection of oneself as its founder in the manner of Hegel._’ I have emphasized the last two sentences deliberately. But the reader will have done so himself, astonished to see attributed to Marxism precisely the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy and, as the summit of this confusion!, find himself accused of Hegelianism if he rejects it... . We shall soon see that there are other motives at issue in such a conception. At any rate, this quotation clearly demonstrates the movement I have been pointing out: Marx is threatened in everything by his youth, so he is recuperated as a _moment of the whole_ and a philosophy of the history of philosophy is constructed to this end, a philosophy which is quite simply – Hegelian. Hoeppner calmly brings this into perspective in his article (‘_A propos du passage de Hegel à Marx_’, _Recherches_, p. 180): ‘History must not be studied from the front backwards, searching for the heights of Marxist knowledge its ideal germs in the past. The evolution of philosophical thought must be traced on the basis of the real evolution of society.’ This is Marx’s own position, extensively developed in the _German Ideology_ for example.

7. ‘Presentation’, p. 7. The reasoning is unambiguous.

8. Cf. Hoeppner (op. cit., p. 178): ‘It is not a question of knowing what Marxist content a Marxist investigation might today be able to read into such passages but rather of knowing what social content they had for Hegel himself.’ Hoeppner’s excellent position on Hegel, opposing Kuczynski who looks in Hegel for ‘Marxist’ themes, is also unreservedly valid for Marx himself when his early works are being read from the standpoint of his mature works.

9. Togliatti, ‘_De Hegel au marxisme_’ (_Recherches_, pp. 38-40).

10. N. Lapine, ‘Critique de la philosophie de Hegel’ (Recherches, pp. 52-71).

11. W. Jahn, ‘Le contenu économique du concept d’aliénation du travail dans les oeuvres de jeunesse de Marx’ (Recherches, pp. 157-74).

12. For example, the two quotations invoked by Togliatti to prove that Marx superseded Hegel are precisely a plagiarism of writings of Feuerbach! Hoeppner, hawk-eyed, has spotted this: ‘The two quotations from the _Manuscripts_ (of 1844) used by Togliatti to show that Marx had by then liberated himself from Feuerbach merely reproduce in essentials the ideas of Feuerbach expressed in the _Provisional Theses_ and the _Principles of the Philosophy of the Future_’ (_op. cit._, p. 184, n. 11). It would be possible to dispute the proof-value of the quotations invoked by Pajitnov on pp. 88 and 109 of his article ‘Les Manuscrits de 1844’ in the same way. The moral of these mistakes is that one should closely read one’s authors. It is not superfluous where Feuerbach is concerned. Marx and Engels discuss him so much, and so well, that it is easy to believe that one knows him intimately.

13. For example, Jahn: a suggestive comparison between the theory of alienation in the _1844 Manuscripts_ and the theory of value in _Capital_.

14. See footnote 5.

15. This formalism is excellently criticized by Hoeppner with respect to Kuczynski (_op. cit._, pp. 177-8).

16. In the theory of sources it is the origin that measures the development. In the theory of anticipation it is the goal that decides the meaning of the moments of the process.

23. Schaff, _op. cit._, p. 202.

24. I ask this question with regard to some third party. But we all know that it is asked of all Marxists who make use of Marx’s Early Writings. If their use of them lacks discernment, if they take essays like _On the Jewish Question_ or the _1843_ and _1844 Manuscripts_ for Marxist writings, if this inspiration gives rise to conclusions for theory and for ideological action, _they have in fact answered the question_, what they do answers for them: the Young Marx can be taken as Marx, the Young Marx was a Marxist. They give openly the answer that the critique I am discussing gives under its breath (by avoiding any answer at all). In both cases, the same principles are at work, and at stake.

25. Jahn, _op. cit._, p. 173, ‘In _The German Ideology_ ... historical materialism found its _adequate terminology._’ But as Jahn’s own essay shows, it is a matter of something quite different from terminology.

26. Lapine, _op. cit._, p. 69.

27. Of course, like any other scientific discipline, Marxism did not _stop_ at Marx any more than physics stopped at Galileo who founded it. Like any other scientific discipline, Marxism developed even in Marx’s own lifetime. New discoveries were made possible by Marx’s basic discovery. It would be very rash to believe that everything has been said.

28. Cf. Auguste Cornu: _Karl Marx et F. Engels_ (PUF Paris), Vol. 1, ‘_Les années d’enfance ef de jeunesse. La Gauche hégélienne_’, the chapter on ‘_la formation de la Gauche hégélienne_’, especially pp. 141 ff. Cornu quite correctly insists on the role of _von Cieskowski_ in the elaboration of a _philosophy of action_ of neo-Hegelian inspiration, adopted by all the young liberal intellectuals of the movement.

29. This is not the place to embark on a study of the concepts at work in the analyses of _The German Ideology._ Instead, one quotation that says everything. On ‘German criticism’ he says: ‘_The whole body of its inquiries has actually sprung from the soil of a definite philosophical system_, _that of Hegel. Not only in their answers_, _but in their very questions there was a mystification_ .’ It could not be better said that it is not answers which make philosophy but the _questions_ posed by the philosophy, and that it is _in the question_ itself, that is, _in the way it reflects that object_ (and not in the object itself) that ideological mystification (or on the contrary an authentic relationship with the object) should be sought.

30. This conclusion is crucial. What actually distinguishes the concept of the _problematic_ from the subjectivist concepts of an idealist interpretation of the development of ideologies is that it brings out within the thought _the objective internal reference system of its particular_ themes, the system of _questions_ commanding the _answers_ given by the ideology. If the meaning of an ideology’s answers is to be understood at this internal level it must first be asked _the question of its questions._ But this problematic is _itself an answer_, no longer to its own internal questions – problems – but to _the objective problems posed_ for ideology _by its time._ A comparison of the problems posed by the ideologue (his problematic) with the _real problems_ posed for the ideologue by his time, makes possible a demonstration of the truly ideological element of the ideology, that is, what characterizes ideology as such, its _deformation._ So it is not _the interiority of the problematic_ which constitutes its essence but its relation to real problems: _the problematic of an ideology_ cannot be demonstrated without _relating_ and _submitting_ it to the real problems to which its deformed enunciation gives a false answer. But I must not anticipate the third point in my exposition (see footnote 45).

31. Such is the meaning of the ‘basic question’ distinguishing materialism from all the forms of idealism.

32. Cf. the excellent passage by Hoeppner, _op. cit._, p. 188. See also p. 184, n. 11.

33. _Already_, because the success of this rupture as of the whole of this liberation process, presupposes that _real history_ is being taken seriously.

34.

35. op. cit.

36. Let us say: of pedagogic truth. As for the famous ‘inversion’ of Hegel, it is a perfect expression for Feuerbach’s project. It was Feuerbach who introduced it and sanctioned it for Hegel’s posterity. And it is remarkable that Marx correctly attacked Feuerbach in _The German Ideology_ for having _remained a prisoner_ of Hegelian philosophy precisely when he was claiming to have ‘inverted’ it. He attacked him for accepting the presuppositions of Hegel’s questions, for giving different answers, but to the same questions. In philosophy _only the questions are indiscreet_, as opposed to everyday life, where it is the answers. Once the questions have been changed it is no longer possible to talk of an _inversion._ No doubt a comparison of the new _relative rank_ of questions and answers to the old one still allows us to talk of an inversion. But it has then become an analogy since _the questions are no longer the same_ and the domains they constitute _are not comparable_, except, as I have suggested, for _pedagogic_ purposes.

37. Cf. footnote 36.

38. This desire to dissipate all ideology and return to ‘the things themselves’, to ‘unveil existence’ (_zur Sache selbst ... Dasein zu enthüllen_) animates the whole of Feuerbach’s philosophy. His terms are the moving expression of this. His tragedy was to have carried out his intentions and yet to have remained a prisoner of the very ideology he desperately hoped to deliver himself from, because he thought his liberation from speculative philosophy in the concepts and problematic of this same philosophy. It was essential to ‘change elements’.

39. Lapine (_op. cit._, pp. 60-61) is excellent on this point. But these intellectual ‘experiments’ of Marx’s do not measure up to the concept of ‘tendency’ (a concept too broad and abstract for them, and one which also reflects the end of the development in progress) in which Lapine wants to think them. On the other hand, I am in profound agreement with Hoeppner (_op. cit._, pp. 186-7): ‘Marx did not reach his solution by resorting to some manipulations of the Hegelian dialectic, but essentially on the basis of very concrete investigations into history, sociology and political economy ... the Marxist dialectic was in its essentials born of the new lands which Marx cleared and opened up for theory ... Hegel and Marx did not drink at the same source.’

40. If there is any meaning to the term ‘supersede’ in its Hegelian sense, it is not established by substituting for it the concept of ‘the negation-which-contains-in-itself-the-term-negated’, thereby stressing the _rupture_ in the conservation, for this rupture in conservation presupposes _a substantial unity in the process_, translated in the Hegelian dialectic by the passage of the in-itself into the for-itself, then to the in-itself-for-itself, etc. But it is precisely the substantial continuity of a process containing its own future _in germ in its own interiority_ which is in dispute here. Hegelian supersession presupposes that the later form of the process is the ‘truth’ of the earlier form. But Marx’s position and his whole critique of ideology implies on the contrary that science (which apprehends reality) constitutes _in its very meaning_ a _rupture_ with ideology and that it sets itself up in _another terrain_, that it constitutes itself _on the basis of new questions_, that it raises _other questions_ about reality than ideology, or what comes to the same thing, it _defines its object_ differently from ideology. Therefore science can by no criteria be regarded as the truth of ideology in the Hegelian sense. If we want a historical predecessor to Marx in this respect we must appeal to Spinoza rather than Hegel. Spinoza established a relation between the first and the second kind of knowledge which, in its immediacy (abstracting from the totality in God), presupposed precisely a radical _discontinuity._ Although the second kind makes possible the understanding of the first, it is not _its truth._

41. Cf. _The German Ideology_ pp. 447-54: ‘The theory which for the English still was simply the registration of a fact becomes for the French a philosophical system.’ (p. 452).

42. See Hoeppner, _op. cit._, pp. 186-7. One further word on the term ‘retreat’. Obviously it should not be understood as meaning the exact opposite of ‘supersession’, except metaphorically. It is not a question of substituting for the understanding of an ideology via its end some kind of understanding of it through its _origins._ All I wanted to illustrate was the fact that even within his ideological consciousness the Young Marx demonstrated an exemplary critical insistence: an insistence on consulting the _originals_ (French political philosophers, English economists, revolutionaries, etc.) which Hegel had discussed. But with Marx himself, this ‘retreat’ ultimately lost the retrospective aspect of a search for the _original_ in the form of an _origin_, as soon as he returned to German history itself and destroyed the illusion of its ‘backwardness’, that is, thought it in its reality without measuring it against an external model as its norm. This _retreat_ was therefore really the current _restoration_, _recuperation_ and _restitution_ of a reality which had been stolen and made unrecognizable by ideology.

43. This was the ‘liberal’ moment of the Young Hegelian movement. Cf. Cornu, _op. cit._, Ch. IV, pp. 132 ff.

44. A theme widely developed by the neo-Hegelians. Cf. Feuerbach: _Provisional Theses for the Reform of Philosophy_, paras. 46 and 47 (_Manifestes philosophiques_, _op. cit._, pp. 116-17).

45. At the heart of this problematic was the implication of the _deformation_ of real historical problems into _philosophical_ problems. The _real problems_ of bourgeois revolution, political liberalism, the freedom of the Press, the end of censorship, the struggle against the Church, etc., were transformed into a _philosophical problem:_ the problem of the reign of Reason whose victory was promised by History despite the _appearances_ of reality. This contradiction between Reason, which is the internal essence and goal of History, and the _reality_ of present history was the neo-Hegelians’ basic _problem._ This _formulation of the problem_ (this problematic) naturally _commanded its solutions:_ if Reason is the goal of History and its essence, it is enough to _show its presence_ even in its most contradictory appearances: the whole solution is thus to be found in the _critical omnipotence_ of philosophy which must become _practical_ by dissipating the aberrations of History in the name of its truth. For a denunciation of the unreasons of real History is merely an exposition of its own reason at work even in its unreasons. Thus the State is indeed truth in action, the incarnation of the truth of History. It is enough to _convert_ it to this truth. That is why this ‘practice’ can be definitively reduced to philosophical _critique_ and theoretical propaganda: it is enough to denounce the unreasons to make them give way, and enough to _speak_ reason for it to carry them away. So everything depends on philosophy which is _par excellence_ the head and heart (after 1840, it is only the head – the heart is to be French) of the Revolution. So much for _the solutions required by the way the basic problem was posed._ But what is infinitely more revealing, and of the problematic itself, is to discover by comparing it to the problems raised for the neo-Hegelians by real History that although _this problematic does provide solutions to real problems_, _it does not correspond to any of these real problems;_ there is nothing at issue between reason and unreason, the unreason is neither an unreason nor an appearance, the State is not liberty in action, etc., that is, the objects which this ideology seems to reflect in its problems are not even represented in their ‘immediate’ reality. By the end of such a comparison, not only do the solutions given by an ideology to its own problems fall (they are merely the reflection of these problems on themselves), but also the problematic itself – and the full extent of the _ideological deformation_ then appears: its mystification of problems and objects. Then we can see what Marx meant when he spoke of the need _to abandon the terrain of Hegelian_ philosophy, since ‘not only in their answers, but in their questions there was a mystification’.

46. Cf. Marx, Letter to Ruge, September 1843.

47. Cf. Engels: ‘_Umrisse zu einer Kritik der Nazionalökonomie;_ Marx later referred to this article as ‘genial’ – it had a great influence on him. Its importance has generally been underestimated.

48. It will be readily understood that to speak of a logic of emergence is not to suggest, with Bergson, a _philosophy of invention._ For this emergence is not the manifestation of I know not what empty essence, freedom or choice; on the contrary, it is merely the effect of its own empirical conditions. I should add that this logic is required by Marx’s own conception of _the history of ideologies._ For ultimately, our conclusion as to the real history of Marx’s discoveries arising from this development _challenges the very existence of the history of ideology._ Once it is clear that the immanentist thesis of the idealist critique has been refuted, that ideological history is not its own principle of intelligibility, once it has been grasped that ideological history can only be understood through the real history which explains its formations, its deformations and their restructurations, and which emerges in it, then it is essential to ask, what survives of this _ideological history_ itself as a _history_, and admit that the answer is nothing. As Marx says, ‘Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. _They have no history_, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking’ (_The German Ideology_, p. 38). To return to our starting-point, I say – and the following two reasons are _one and the same reason_ – that ‘the history of philosophy’ can not be written ‘in the future anterior’, not simply because the future anterior is not a category of historical understanding – but also because strictly speaking the history of philosophy _does not exist._

### 8. The Controversy about Marx

---

  

"The realm of freedom actually begins only where labor which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production. Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilized man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialized man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favorable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working-day is its basic prerequisite."

- _Capital_

#### 1. "Young Marx" versus "mature Marx"

It is impossible to deal with the various interpretations of Marx's theory of alienation in a systematic way within the confines of this study. All we can do is to choose a few characteristic points which help to clarify some questions of importance, and thus carry a step forward the main arguments of this inquiry.

One of the most controversial issues is: what place ought to be assigned to the early works of Marx in his system as a whole?

Ever since the publication of the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ many philosophers have maintained that the young Marx ought to be treated separately, because there is a _break_ between the thinker who deals with problems of alienation and the "mature Marx" who aspires to a scientific socialism. And, strangely enough, the holders of this view belonged to politically opposite camps. Their differences amounted to this, that while the one camp idealized the young Marx and opposed his early manuscripts to his later works, the other only accepted these latter, and dismissed his earlier writings as idealistic.

In his study of _The Early Development of Marx's Thought_, John Macmurray characterized these approaches in this way: "Communists are rather liable to misinterpret this early stage even if they do not entirely discount it. They are naturally apt to read these writings in order to find in them the reflection of their own theory as it stands today, and, therefore, to dismiss as youthful aberrations those elements which do not square with the final outcome. This is, of course, highly undialectical. It would equally be a misunderstanding of Marx to separate the early stages of his thought from their conclusion, though not to the same extent. For they _are_ earlier stages, and though they can only be fully understood in terms of the theory which is their final outcome, they are historically earlier and the conclusion was not explicitly in the mind of Marx when his earlier works were written."[[197]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#197)

These words were published as far back as 1935, but the highly undialectical separation of the young Marx from the later Marx has not disappeared in the years that separate us from the early thirties. On the contrary, the assertion of a supposed break has become an accepted commonplace in a considerable amount of current philosophical literature.

Is it true, as is often affirmed, that the notion of alienation "drops out" from the later writings of Marx; indeed, that he treats it ironically, thus detaching himself from his own philosophical past? Two references are usually given in support of this thesis: one to _The German Ideology_ and the other to the _Communist Manifesto_. The question is, however, are the passages in question rightly interpreted?

Undoubtedly there are ironical sentences in _The German Ideology_ which contain the words "estrangement" or "self-estrangement." There are actually two of them. The first says that "This 'estrangement' (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two _practical_ premises."[[198]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#198) And the second adds: "The whole process was thus conceived as a process of the self-estrangement of 'man'."[[Lenin og Trotskij - hvad de virkelig stod for-1721231999283.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#199) The translator and Editor, Roy Pascal, comments in his notes on these passages: "In _The German Ideology_ Marx makes his _final reckoning_ with this concept of 'self-estrangement'." This "final reckoning" is supposed to be in sharp contrast to the earlier _Manuscripts of 1844_ in which Marx still "_wrestles_ with this concept, and charges it with a new content."[[200]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#200)

This contraposition is highly misleading. "Final reckoning" following the previous "wresting" sounds pretty dramatic and is in keeping with the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute's preface to the edition of _The German Ideology_. This preface greatly exaggerates the differences of this latter from the earlier writings and claims as radical innovations points that had, in fact, been worked out in the _Manuscripts of 1844_, or even earlier. Yet the simple, undramatic truth is that there is neither a "final reckoning" in _The German Ideology_, nor some kind of a "wrestling" in the Paris manuscripts which could be interpreted as lagging behind the presumed mature reckoning. Indeed the position criticizing the idealistic philosophers - our first quotation - and referring the matter of alienation to _practice_, had been reached by Marx well _before_ the _Manuscripts of 1844_ (see especially his _Introduction to the Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right_).

Marx made it explicit more than once in his _Manuscripts of 1844_ that he sets out from the language of political economy in order to rescue its achievements, which remained hidden to the political economists themselves, as well as to criticize them in their own terms. He adopted exactly the same approach towards idealistic philosophy. This is why he could never "drop" the concept of alienation: it would have amounted to depriving himself of a _real_ achievement (i.e. extracting the "rational kernel" of the Hegelian philosophy) _notwithstanding_ its mystifying setting. In the disputed passage Marx simply wants to point out - as he does on numerous occasions in the Paris Manuscripts - that the language of "estrangement" is mystifying _without_ the necessary references to social _practice_.

As to the second quotation, a more careful reading will make it clear that it has nothing to do with the rejection of the term of "self-estrangement." The relevant passage reads as follows: "The individuals, who are no longer subject to the division of labor, have been conceived by the philosophers as an _ideal_, under the name _'man'_. They have conceived the whole process which we have outlined as the evolutionary process of 'man,' so that at every historical stage 'man' was substituted for the _individuals_ and shown as the motive force of history. The whole process was thus conceived as a process of the self-estrangement of _'man,'_ and this was essentially due to the fact that the average individual of the later stage was always foisted on to the earlier stage, and the consciousness of a later age on to the individuals of an earlier. Through this inversion, which from the first is an abstract image of the actual conditions, it was possible to transform the whole of history into an evolutionary process of _consciousness_."[[201]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#201)

As we can see, there is nothing that even vaguely resembles a final reckoning, but only an argument quite familiar to us from the _Manuscripts of 1844_. What Marx is ironical about is not the concept of self-estrangement, but philosophical abstractionism which substitutes for the _real_ (historically and socially concrete) _individual_ the idealistic image of _abstract man_, and thus mystifies the _actual_ estrangement of _real man_ (the social individual) by representing it as the estrangement of _consciousness_. In other words, what he objects to is the identification of the concept of man with abstract, _generic consciousness_. This objection, well known to us also from his earlier writings, does not make the notion of "the self-estrangement of real man" obsolete in the least.

The reference to the _Communist Manifesto_ is no more convincing. This is the passage in question: "It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints _over_ the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German _literati_ reversed this process with the profane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they wrote _'Alienation of Humanity,'_ and beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote _'Dethronement of the Category of the General,'_ and so forth. The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of French historical criticism they dubbed 'Philosophy of Action,' 'True Socialism,' 'German Science of Socialism,' 'Philosophical Foundations of Socialism,' and so on. The French socialist and communist literature was thus _completely emasculated_. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome 'French one-sidedness' and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of _Truth_; not the interests of the _proletariat_, but the _interests of human nature, of man in general_, who belongs to no class, has no _reality_, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical _fantasy_."[[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#202)

Again, we can see, the criticism is not directed against the concept of alienation, but the _idealist use_ of it, because such a use "completely emasculates" it, deprives it of its concrete social content and power of _practical_ criticism. Equally, what is attacked here is not the notion of _man_ defined by Marx in 1844 as the social individual, but the abstraction "human nature" and "man in general" as used by his opponents, because these only exist in the "misty realm of philosophical fantasy." Quite the opposite of a _break_: the most remarkable _continuity_. Every single point made in this passage can easily be found even in Marx's _Introduction to the Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right_ which preceded, as we all know, not only _The German Ideology_, but also the _Manuscripts of 1844_. Here are a few quotations to prove this assertion:

1. "But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is _the world of man_, the state, society."

2. "If the speculative philosophy of right, that abstract extravagant _thinking_ on the modern state, the reality of which remains a thing of the beyond, if only beyond the Rhine, was possible only in Germany, inversely the _German_ thought-image of the modern state which makes abstraction of _real man_ was possible only because and insofar as the modern state itself makes abstraction of _real man_ or satisfies _the whole_ of man only in imagination. In politics the Germans _thought_ what other nations _did_."

3. "No class in civil society has any need or capacity for general emancipation until it is forced by its _immediate_ condition, by _material_ necessity, by its _very chains_. Where, then, is the _positive_ possibility of a German emancipation? _Answer:_ In the formation of a class with _radical chains_, a class of civil society which is not a class of civil society, an estate which is the dissolution of all estates, . This dissolution of society as a particular estate is the _proletariat_."[[203]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#203)

In reading these passages, should not one be struck by the basic identity of the early Marx's approach with that of his later work?

Nothing could be further removed from the truth than to assert - no matter from which political point of view - that from 1845 onwards Marx is no longer interested in man and his alienation, because his critical attention is then diverted in another direction by the introduction of the concepts of "the classes" and "the proletariat." As we have seen, these concepts had acquired a crucial importance in his thought already in 1843. We must emphasize that if by "man" one means, as Marx's opponents did, "abstract man" or "man in general" who is "abstracted from all social determinations," then this is completely beside the point. He was, in fact, _never_ interested in this "man," not even _before_ 1843, let alone at the time of writing the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_. On the other hand "real man," the "self-mediating being of nature," the "social individual" _never_ disappeared from his horizon. Even towards the end of his life when he was working on the third volume of _Capital_, Marx advocated for human beings the "conditions most favorable to, and worthy of, their _human nature_."[[204]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#204) Thus his concern with classes and the proletariat in particular _always_ remained to him identical with the concern for "the _general human_ emancipation"[[205]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#205) - a program clearly laid down in the same early _Introduction to the Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right_. And this program, formulated in these words, is only another expression for what he called elsewhere the "transcendence of alienation."

But what about the concept of alienation in Marx's works which followed the _Manuscripts of 1844_? Why did he "drop" this concept (or why did he drop the "word," as others put it) if he remained faithful to his program of transcending alienation? The simple answer is that he did _not_ drop the word at all, let alone the concept. As a matter of fact there is _ample_ evidence to show that Marx went on using the word "alienation" up to the very end of his life. So ample is this evidence that even if we confine ourselves to the word _Entfremdung_, taken - as in the Paris Manuscripts - with its predicative forms (leaving out, that is, _Entäußerung_ and _Veräußerung_: i.e. two further words which mean "alienation," as well as _Verdinglichung, Verselbstständigung, Fetischismus_, etc.) we can only give a very modest selection of the expressions in which the disputed word occurs. For a _complete_ reproduction of all the relevant passages containing also these closely related terms, we would need to multiply the length of this chapter several times over. Here then is our limited sample, in chronological order. (For obvious reason we have to reproduce these passages in the original German. Translation is given in Note No. [[206]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#206))

_The Holy Family_: Quite a few passages from the _Manuscripts of 1844_ were incorporated into this later work. Contrary to some assertions, these presumably idealistic passages which dealt with the problem of "alienation" were known to, and approvingly quoted by, Lenin.

_The German Ideology_: "solange die Menschen sich in der naturwüchsigen Gesellschaft befinden, solange also die Spaltung zwischen dem besondern und gemeinsamen Interesse existiert, solange die Tätigkeit also nicht freiwillig, sondern naturwüchsig geteilt ist, _die eigne Tat des Menschen ihm zu einer Fremden, gegenüberstehenden Macht wird_, die ihn unterjocht, statt dass er sie beherrscht." (Just as in the good, or bad, old days, alienation is presented as the transformation of man's - the purists should notice: _man's_ and not _men's_ or the _classes'_ - own activity into an _alien power that confronts him_; as such it is opposed to freedom, or free activity.) "Eben weil die Individuen nur ihr besondres, für sie nicht mit ihrem gemeinschaftlichen Interesse zusammenfallendes suchen, überhaupt das Allgemeine illusorische Form der Gemeinschaftlichkeit, wird dies als ein ihnen _'fremdes' und von ihnen 'unabhängiges'_, als ein selbst wieder besonderes und eigentümliches 'Allgemein'-Interesse geltend gemacht, oder sie selbst müssen sich in diesem Zwiespalt bewegen, wie in der Demokratie." (Two points should be noticed: 1) Marx does not say that the particular interests of the individuals are _identical_ with their communal interests, but that they should not follow _exclusively_ their particular interests; doing this actually defeats their purpose, superimposing on them their real communal interests in an alienated form as abstract "general interest." 2) The illusory depiction of man's real communal interests as an abstract "general interest" - what he calls elsewhere "the legalistic illusion" - and its representation as something quite different from the actual human individual, hides a real alienation: man's _self-alienation_ in the form of the "_Spaltung_ zwischen dem _besondern und gemeinsamen Interesse_". It is on this basis that real alienation can be mystified by the philosophers as the alienation of "man," meaning by "man," as Marx commented: "_Der_ Mensch = dem 'denkenden Menschengeist'." ["_Man_ = the 'thinking human spirit'."] In reality "general-interest" is not a separate "essence" that should be contrasted with and opposed to the "individual essence" of Man; it is only an alienated expression of an actual state of alienation. Real man is the "wirklicher historischen Mensch" to whom his communal interest actually "belongs" - i.e. it is inseparable from his nature as a social individual being - even if in a given historical situation it confronts him in an alienated form. This is why one can think of alienation as capable of supersession).

"mit der kommunistischen Regelung der Produktion und der darin liegenden _Vernichtung der Fremdheit, mit der sich die Menschen zu ihren eigenen Produkt verhalten_, die Macht des Verhältnisses von Nachfrage und Zufuhr sich in Nichts auflöst..."

"In der bisherigen Geschichte... die einzelnen Individuen mit der Ausdehnung der Tätigkeit zur Weltgeschichtlichen immer mehr unter einer ihnen _fremden_ Macht geknechtet worden sind...."

"... _Bedingungen_, die bisher dem Zufall überlassen waren und _sich gegen die einzelnen Individuen_ eben durch ihre Trennung als Individuen... _zu einem ihnen fremden Bande_ geworden war, _verselbständigt hatten_. ...In der Vorstellung sind daher die Individuen unter der Bourgeoisherrschaft _freier als früher, weil ihnen ihre Lebensbedingungen zufällig sind_; in der Wirklichkeit sind sie natürlich _unfreier, weil mehr unter sachliche Gewalt subsumiert."_ (MEWE, Vol. 3, pgs. 33, 34, 49, 42, 35, 37, 75-76)

_Communist Manifesto_: _"der Macht über fremde Arbeit"_; "Der Kommunismus nimmt keinen die Macht, sich gesellschaftliche Produkte anzueignen, er nimmt nur die Macht, sich durch diese _Aneignung fremde Arbeit_ zu unterjochen" (MEWE, Vol. 4, pgs. 476, 477).

_Wage Labor and Capital_: "Je rascher die Arbeiterklasse die ihr _feindliche Macht, den fremden, über sie gebietenden Reichtum_ vermehrt und vergrößert, unter desto günstigeren Bedingungen wird ihr erlaubt, von neuem an der Vermehrung des bürgerlichen Reichtums, an der Vergrößerung der Macht des Kapitals zu arbeiten, zufrieden, sich selbst die goldenen Ketten zu schmieden, woran die Bourgeoisie sie hinter sich herschleift" (MEWE, Vol. 6, pg. 416).

_Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy (Rohentwurf)_: This work contains _hundreds_ of pages where the problems of alienation are analyzed in a comprehensive way. The words "Entfremdung", "entfremdet" etc. occur on these pages _several hundred times_. I have chosen one passage only. It will show not only how wrong they are who assert that "alienation" has dropped out from Marx's later works, but also that his approach to the discussed problems is essentially the same as in the _Manuscripts of 1844_. This passage reads as follows: "Der Ton wird gelegt nicht auf das _Vergegenständlichtsein_, sondern das _Entfremdet-_, Entäußert-, Veräußertsein, das Nicht-dem-Arbeiter-, sondern den personifizierten Produktionsbedingungen-, i.e. dem-Kapital-Zugehören der ungeheuren gegenständlichen Macht, die die gesellschaftliche _Arbeit selbst sich_ als eins ihrer Momente _gegenübergestellt hat_. Soweit auf dem Standpunkt des Kapitals und der Lohnarbeit die Erzeugung dieses gegenständlichen Leibes der Tätigkeit im Gegensatz zum unmittelbaren Arbeitsvermögen geschieht - dieser Prozess der Vergegenständlichung in fact als _Prozess der Entäußerung_ vom Standpunkt der Arbeit aus oder der _Aneignung fremder Arbeit_ vom Standpunkt des Kapitals aus erscheint -, ist diese Verdrehung und Verkehrung eine _wirkliche_, keine bloß _gemeinte_, bloß in der Vorstellung der Arbeiter und Kapitalisten existierende. Aber offenbar ist dieser Verkehrungsprozess bloß _historische_ Notwendigkeit, bloß Notwendigkeit für die Entwicklung der Produktivkräfte von einem bestimmten historischen Ausgangspunkt aus, oder Basis aus, aber keineswegs eine _absolute_ Notwendigkeit der Produktion; vielmehre eine verschwindende, und das Resultat und der Zweck (immanente) dieses Prozesses ist diese Basis selbst aufzuheben, wie diese Form des Prozesses. Die bürgerlichen Ökonomen sind so eingepfercht in den Vorstellungen einer bestimmten historischen Entwicklungsstufe der Gesellschaft, dass die Notwendigkeit der _Vergegenständlichung_ der gesellschaftlichen Mächte der Arbeit ihnen unzertrennbar erscheint von der Notwendigkeit der _Entfremdung_ derselben _gegenüber der lebendigen Arbeit_. Mit der Aufhebung aber des _unmittelbaren_ Charakters der lebendigen Arbeit als bloß _einzelner_, oder als bloß innerlich, oder bloß äußerlich allgemeiner, mit dem Setzen der Tätigkeit der Individuen als _unmittelbar allgemeiner oder gesellschaftlicher_, wird den gegenständlichen Momenten der Produktion diese _Form der Entfremdung_ abgestreift; sie werden damit gesetzt als Eigentum, als der _organische gesellschaftliche Leib_, worin die Individuen sich reproduzieren als Einzelne, aber als _gesellschaftliche Einzelne_." (_Rohentwurf_, pg. 716). (Here we have even the "anthropological" notions of the early Marx, together with the conception of the supersession of alienation as the transcendence of the abstract _mediated_ character of human activity).

_Theories of Surplus-Value_: As one would expect from a critical monograph on past theories of surplus-value, this monumental work, (almost 2,000 pages long) has many references to "alienation." For instance, dealing with Linguet's theories, Marx writes: "Die Reichen haben sich aller Produktionsbedingungen bemächtigt; (dies führte zur) _Entfremdung der Produktionsbedingungen_, die in ihrer einfachsten Form die Naturelemente selbst sind." But there are places of a different kind too, where "Entfremdung" etc. do not simply occur in the summary or quotation of someone else's argument, but in the exposition of Marx's own ideas. For instance: "Der _Zins_ an sich drückt also grade das Dasein der Arbeitsbedingungen als _Kapital_ in ihrem gesellschaftlichen Gegensatz und ihrer Metamorphose als persönliche Mächte gegenüber der Arbeit und über die Arbeit aus. Er resümiert den _entfremdeten Charakter der Arbeitsbedingungen_ im Verhältnis zur Tätigkeit des Subjekts. Er stellt das Eigentum des Kapitals oder das bloße Kapitaleigentum als Mittel dar, die _Produkte fremder Arbeit_ sich anzueignen als _Herrschaft über fremde Arbeit_. Aber er stellt diesen Charakter des Kapitals dar als etwas, was ihm _außer_ dem Produktionsprozess selbst zukommt und keineswegs das Resultat der spezifischen Bestimmtheit dieses Produktionsprozesses selbst ist." One could fill many pages with passages of this kind which can be found in Marx's _Theories of Surplus-Value_. (For the reported two passages cf. MEWE, Vol. 26. Part I., pg. 321 and Part III. pg. 485).

_Capital_: "Die verselbständigte und _entfremdete Gestalt_"; "Da vor seinem Eintritt in den Prozess seine eigne Arbeit _ihm selbst entfremdet_, dem Kapitalisten angeeignet und dem Kapital einverleibt ist, vergegenständlicht sie sich während des Prozesses beständig. in fremden Produkt... Der Arbeiter selbst produziert daher beständig den objektiven Reichtum als Kapital, _ihm fremde_, ihn beherrschende und ausbeutende Macht, und der Kapitalist produziert ebenso beständig die Arbeitskraft als subjektive, von ihren eignen Vergegenständlichungs- und Verwirklichungsmitteln getrennte, abstrakte, in der bloßen Leiblichkeit des Arbeiters existierende Reichtumsquelle, _kurz den Arbeiter als Lohnarbeiter_."; "alle Mittel zur Entwicklung der Produktion... verstümmeln den Arbeiter in einen Teilmenschen, entwürdigen ihn zum Anhängsel der Maschine, vernichten mit der Qual seiner Arbeit ihren Inhalt, _entfremden ihm die geistigen Potenzen_ des Arbeitsprozesses im selben Masse, worin letzterem die _Wissenschaft als selbständige Potenz_ einverleibt wird;..."; "diese Produktionsmittel treten dem Besitzer der Arbeitskraft gegenüber als _fremdes Eigentum_. Andererseits steht der Verkäufer der Arbeit ihrem Kauf er gegenüber als _fremde Arbeitskraft_, ..."; "Diese Vorstellungsweise ist um so weniger befremdlich, als ihr der Schein der Tatsachen entspricht, und als das Kapitalverhältnis in der Tat den innern Zusammenhang verbirgt in der vollständigen _Gleichgültigkeit, Äußerlichkeit, und Entfremdung_, worin es den Arbeiter versetzt gegenüber den Bedingungen der Verwirklichung seiner eignen Arbeit."; "Es bleibt jedoch nicht bei der _Entfremdung_ und Gleichgültigkeit zwischen dem Arbeiter, dem Träger der lebendigen Arbeit hier, und der ökonomischen, d.h. rationellen und sparsamen Anwendung seiner Arbeitsbedingungen dort."; "Das Kapital zeigt sich immer mehr als gesellschaftliche Macht... - aber als _entfremdete, verselbständigte gesellschaftliche Macht, die als Sache_, und als Macht des Kapitalisten durch diese Sache, _der Gesellschaft gegenübertritt_"; "Dieser _Entfremdung_ der Produktionsbedingung vom Produzenten entspricht hier aber eine wirkliche Umwälzung in der Produktionsweise selbst."; "die wirklichen Produktionsagenten in diesen _entfremdeten und irrationellen Formen_ von Kapital - Zins, Boden - Rente, Arbeit - Arbeitslohn, sich völlig zu Hause fühlen, denn es sind eben die Gestaltungen des Scheins, in welchem sie sich bewegen und womit sie täglich zu tun haben" (MEWE, Vol. 23; Vol. I of _Capital_ - pgs. 455, 596, 674; Vol. 24; Vol. II of _Capital_ - pg. 37; Vol. 25; Vol. III of _Capital_ - pgs. 95, 96, 274, 610, 838).

Reading these quotations will, perhaps, suffice to suggest an answer to the question: just how much attention should be paid to the "drop-out" theory. It should be clear by now that _none_ of the meanings of alienation as used by Marx in the _Manuscripts of 1844_ dropped out from his later writings. And no wonder. For the concept of alienation, as grasped by Marx in 1844, with all its complex ramifications, is not a concept which could be dropped, or one-sidedly "translated." As we have seen in various parts of this study, the concept of alienation is a vitally important pillar of the Marxian system as a whole, and not merely one brick of it. To drop it, or to translate it one-sidedly, would, therefore, amount to nothing short of the complete demolition of the building itself and the re-erection, perhaps, of its chimney only. That some people have been - or are still - engaged in such operations, trying to build their "scientific" theories on chimney-tops decorated with Marxist terminology, is not in doubt here. The point is that their efforts should not be confused with the Marxian theory itself.

#### 2. "Philosophy" versus "political economy"

The numerous versions of the "young Marx" versus "mature Marx" (or the other way round) approach have something in common. This is: an effort to oppose political economy to philosophy or philosophy to political economy and use Marx as a supporting authority in favor of such pseudo-alternative. Broadly speaking those who want to evade or reject the vital - and by no means speculative - philosophical problems of freedom and the individual, side with the "mature political economist" or "scientific" Marx, whereas those who wish the practical power of Marxism (which is inseparable from its demystification of capitalist economy) never existed exalt the "young philosopher Marx."

Needless to say, there is something extremely artificial and arbitrary in this contraposition. It is, therefore, not surprising at all to find that the constructions based on this prefabricated opposition do not stand up to examination. Thus, for instance, we can read from the pen of Daniel Bell about a presumed transmutation in Marx's _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts_: "The title itself is both literal and _symbolic_. Beginning as an _anthropology_, it ends as a _political economy_."[[207]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#207) What should we think of this statement? What is the title "symbolic" of? It cannot be of anything in Marx because he never gave these manuscripts a title himself. (As is made explicit in a footnote, the title was given by the editors of the Moscow Institute of Marxism-Leninism.) And what about the assertion that this work _begins_ as an anthropology and _ends_ as a political economy? For this is how it _actually_ begins: "_Wages_ are determined through the _antagonistic struggle_ between _capitalist_ and _worker_. Victory goes necessarily to the capitalist." This means that the _Manuscripts of 1844_ begin as full-blooded "mature Marx" with the notions of political economy. True, there is a short _Introduction_ to the volume in which there are references to Feuerbach which might, perhaps, be construed as beginning as an anthropology. But this _Introduction_ - as the same footnote tells the reader - was written _after the completion_ of the rest of the Manuscripts. Thus if one said that the Manuscripts begin with political economy and finish with philosophy, this would reflect a simple chronological fact. This, however, could not fit into a construction which seeks to assert the exact opposite and make something terribly significant out of it.

It would be a waste of the reader's time to analyze these constructions were they not significant _ideologically_. Daniel Bell borrows his grotesque ideas on young Marx from R.W. Tucker to whom, in his own words, he is "indebted for many insights."[[208]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#208) Now Tucker's efforts, expressed in his book _Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx_, are directed at a complete emasculation of the Marxian ideas so that the unsuspecting reader would be led into believing that _"Marx's concept of communism is more nearly applicable to present-day America, for example, than his concept of capitalism."_[[209]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#209) The object of such exercises is to "demonstrate" the meaninglessness of the Marxian "abstractions," and Daniel Bell willingly contributes his share of hot air to keep Tucker's balloon flying. Talking about the revival of interest in young Marx he writes:

"To the extent that this is an effort to find a new, radical critique of society, the effort is an encouraging one. But to the extent - and this seems as much to be the case - that it is a form of new myth-making, in order to cling to the symbol of Marx, it is wrong. For while it is _the early Marx_, it is _not the **historical** Marx_. The historical Marx had, in effect, _repudiated the idea of alienation_... The irony, however, is that in moving from "philosophy" to "reality," from phenomenology to political economy, Marx himself had moved from _one kind of abstraction to another_. For in his system, self-alienation becomes transformed: man as "generic man" (i.e. Man writ large) becomes divided into _classes of men_. The only social reality is not Man, not the individual, but _economic **classes**. Individuals, and their motives, count for naught."_[[210]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#210)

Here the ideological motivations, despite all the efforts to keep them in the background, come out into the open. For so long as there is some hope that young Marx would be used against the economic "abstractions" of the "historical Marx," the effort is hailed as an encouraging radical critique of society. If, however, people do not fall for this anti-Marxist separation but recognize the essential continuity of the Marxian thought, this must be condemned as "a form of myth-making, in order to cling to the symbol of Marx." The construction opposing the "young philosopher" to the "mature political economist Marx" must be maintained at all costs, even if the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.[[211]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#211) The mystifying - and crudely falsifying - interpretation according to which the "original philosophical expression" of Marx's ideas embodied a timeless _"socio-psychological condition"_[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#212) (with no reference to capitalism, classes, exploitation, social antagonisms, etc.) must be maintained so that "the historical Marx" and those who pay attention to him could be dismissed as guilty of "myth-making."

Thus in Bell's view the Marxian "abstractions" ought to be distributed between two classes: (1) the young Marx's categories, allegedly related to those timeless, philosophically respectable "socio-psychological" conditions, and (2) the "economic abstractions" of the mature Marx which, _horribile dictu_, criticize capitalism. And of course one is welcome to toy with the philosophico-psychological categories of "the human condition"[[213]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#213) - thus earning the praise: "a radical critique of society" - provided that (a) _capitalism_ is never mentioned in this "radical critique" of "society," and that (b) the Marxian "economic abstractions" are condemned by our "radicals," because such "abstractions" do not lend themselves to mystifying twists and falsifications.

This "detached," "non-ideological" analysis of Marxism is taken a stage further - to the point of personal vilification:

"Although Marx drew most of his ideas from his peers - self-consciousness from Bauer, alienation from Feuerbach, communism from Moses Hess, the stages of property from Proudhon - he was not content, simply, to synthesize these ideas, but had to attack, and usually viciously, all these individuals _in the determined effort to appear wholly original."_[[214]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#214)

No further comments are required. Our quotation, reproducing Daniel Bell's own words, set alongside the title of his book - _The End of Ideology_ - speak loudly enough for themselves.

Admittedly, in the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ Marx spoke about the task of superseding political economy. But in the same breath he also spoke about the practical abolition of philosophy. These propositions stand or fall together because they are related to one and the same historical task as seen by Marx. It is, therefore, quite arbitrary to pick one of them and to use it against the other.

When Marx referred to the task of superseding philosophy and political economy, he did not mean superseding the one by "vulgar economism" and the other by "anthropology," or a "philosophico-psychological" analysis of the "human condition," etc. As we have seen, the point he was making was that philosophy and political economy apply a "_different_ and _opposite_ yardstick to man," both of them in an equally _exclusivist_ manner, standing "in an estranged relation to the other," since their points of reference are basically different. And he wanted to supersede them by something that is neither traditional philosophy nor traditional political economy.

He realized that the different and opposite yardsticks as ordering criteria of the particular theoretical fields inevitably result in "integralistic" attempts that embrace only those aspects of the complex problems of reality which can be easily fitted into the isolated, special schemes, arbitrarily excluding all the other aspects and antagonistically opposing those disciplines which work out their generalizations on the basis of these excluded aspects. This is why Marx opposed to the arbitrary integralism of the particular theoretical fields - which he explained as a necessarily alienated reflection of practical alienation - the ideal of a "human science," i.e. the non-alienated _synthesis_ of _all_ aspects. A "human science" oriented by a non-artificial and all-inclusive measure: man himself. (Marx's own expressions were: "there will be one science," "the science of man").

The supersession of philosophy and political economy in this conception does not mean the abolition of the problems of either traditional philosophy or those of political economy, nor indeed a running away from them. Marx is convinced that philosophical etc. problems cannot be "abolished" (or "dissolved") in thought, only in _social practice_, because they are expressions of reality, however mystified and alienated they may be. Equally, he is convinced that one must not evade them, or simply declare that they are mystifications and leave everything at that, but face up to them and meet them at the level where they present themselves. Therefore the critique of traditional philosophy or political economy implies the positive elaboration of alternatives to the persistent old questions.

It goes without saying that, in Marx's view, such a task cannot be accomplished within the limits of either philosophy or political economy. To turn political economy into a "super-science" to which everything else should be subordinated would certainly amount to "economic determinism." And, as we have seen, nothing is further removed from Marx than that. He knows very well that political economy is just as one-sidedly integralistic as philosophy, and more dangerous in the sense that its representatives often have direct access to power.

Thus when he develops his criticism of political economy - no matter in how great a detail or how many highly technical problems are taken into account - he is not the "political economist mature Marx." Nor is he indeed the "young philosopher" or "anthropologist" Marx when he criticizes Hegel. The earliest comprehensive idea of young Marx was the unification of philosophy with practical human reality, and this went far beyond the horizon of traditional philosophy. Whenever Marx analyses philosophical problems, in his youth or in his old age, he always tries to do this in the form of synthesizing - in an "aufgehoben" sense - the most general philosophical formulations with the insights gained from actual human experience as well as from its theoretical and artistic reflections: from history to political economy, and from Shakespeare and Goethe to Balzac. And, of course, he proceeds in the same way when he discusses the problems of political economy: by mobilizing the whole range of human experience known to him - e.g. Shakespeare on money in the Paris Manuscripts as well as in _Capital_ - and synthesizing it with the fundamental insights he gained from the critical study of the most comprehensive general formulations of philosophy.

It is, therefore, simply not true that the mature Marx had no time for or interest in the problems of philosophy. His interest in philosophy was _never_ "philosophical": it was always practical-human. Nor was his interest in political economy "scientific-economical": it was also practical-human. Thus for him both philosophy and political economy were from the beginning merged in a practical-human concern. In the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ Marx was not less interested in "political economy" than in his _Rohentwurf_ or in _Capital_. Or, to put it the other way round, in these latter he was not less doing "philosophy" - of course _his_ kind of philosophy, just as in the early works - than in the Paris Manuscripts. The people who deny this tend to be either those who crudely identify "human" with "economic," or those who, in the name of mystifying psychological abstractions, treat with extreme skepticism the relevance of socioeconomic measures to the solution of human problems. To assert, however, the radical break in Marx's development, undisturbed by the evidence of his work as a whole, is to deduce a little too much from a mere title Marx himself never gave to an unfinished manuscript.

#### 3. Marx's intellectual development

The rejection of the "young Marx" versus "mature Marx" dichotomy does not mean the denial of Marx's intellectual development. What is turned down is the dramatized idea of a radical reversal of his position in the aftermath of the _Manuscripts of 1844_.

This is not the place to discuss in detail the complex problems of Marx's intellectual development. There are, however, a few aspects of it - those directly related to the problems raised in the previous section - which ought to be touched upon, if only briefly, in this context.

(1) The concept of alienation played a minor role in Marx's thought prior to 1843. Even in 1843 its importance was relatively small as compared with the _Manuscripts of 1844_. The point of really significant change is not between 1844 and 1845 but between 1843 and 1844. (And even this change is far more complex than the vulgarizers - who can only operate with crude schemes like "idealism" versus "materialism" etc. - imagine).

To see the contrast, it is enough to read a short passage from Marx's _Introduction to the Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right_. It says: "Criticism of heaven turns into criticism of the earth, _criticism of religion_ into _criticism of right_ and _criticism of theology_ into _criticism of politics_."[[215]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#215) Unquestionably, Marx's insight concerning the task of unifying philosophy with practice can be perceived here. Yet at this stage of his development it is expressed in a rather generic form. If we are able to recognize the genius of this Marxian insight it is because we are aware of its later elaborated, immensely far-reaching implications, thanks to the keys we were given by Marx himself, in the works that followed this Introduction. Had Marx remained at the abstract programmatic level of generalization which characterizes this _Introduction_ he could hardly have exercised the sort of influence he did on later intellectual and social developments.

Marx of the _Manuscripts of 1844_ made a great step forward, as we have seen in several contexts. By recognizing that the key to all alienation - religious, juridical, moral, artistic, political, etc. - is "alienated labor," the alienated form of man's practical productive activity, he was able to base his whole conception on a sure footing. Now it became possible for him to elaborate his ideas in a most concrete form, indicating the strategic points of the necessary practical activity. Since the concept of "labor's self-alienation" pinpointed the ultimate cause of all forms of alienation, the criticism of economics - i.e. an adequate understanding of its laws and mechanisms - acquired a crucial importance: it became the vital link in the program of gaining mastery over the various causal factors involved, serving the purpose of practically superseding alienation in all spheres of life. While the earlier _Introduction_ went only as far as emphasizing that the criticism of theology must be transformed into the criticism of _politics_, the _Manuscripts of 1844_ accomplished the structurally vital step of turning the criticism of politics into the criticism of _economics_. Thus the earlier, abstractly programmatic character of the Marxian ideas had been effectively superseded. Marx did not have to stop any longer at the point of postulating the unity of theory and practice (see Chapter II on Marx's own references to a "categorical imperative" in the _Introduction_), he could now concretely demonstrate _how_ to realize in social practice this revolutionary program.

And this is how the concept of alienation became the central concept of Marx's whole theory. It is, therefore, not only not true that when Marx acquired an interest in the problems of political economy he turned his back on the concept of alienation: the exact opposite is true. For as soon as he realized that economic alienation was the common link of all forms of alienation and dehumanization, it was impossible for him _not_ to adopt the concept of alienation - this structural common denominator - as the center of reference of his entire conception. The _Manuscripts of 1844_ provide massive evidence in support of this view. They also show that, enriched by the insights he gained from his critical study of political economy, his philosophical criticism became more profound and comprehensive than ever before.

(2) There can be no doubt about Feuerbach's influence on Marx: he himself acknowledged this on more than one occasion. The question is, however, what did this influence really amount to in 1844, or indeed towards the end of 1843? Greatly exaggerated claims are made in this regard which, if true, would reduce Marx - up to the time he jotted down his _Theses on Feuerbach_ - into a mere follower of the latter.

We possess two important letters addressed by Marx to Feuerbach which help to dispel this legend. Already the first of them - written on the 3rd of October 1843 - reveals a substantial difference of approach. In the spirit of Marx's general line of thought at that time, it advocates the criticism of society in the form of the criticism of politics. Marx would like to see Feuerbach actively involved in this effort and asks for his contribution accordingly:

"Schelling succeeded in uniting not only philosophy and theology but also philosophy and diplomacy. He turned philosophy into the general science of diplomacy, into a diplomacy for all. An attack on Schelling would, therefore, be an indirect attack on our whole, namely Prussian, political system. Schelling's philosophy is Prussian politics _sub specie philosophiae_."[[216]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#216)

Perhaps Marx had illusions about Feuerbach's willingness or ability to engage in such battles against the existing order, perhaps he only wanted to enlist the support of a powerful ally and at the same time, as a good editor, push his would-be collaborator forward in radicalism, bringing him into line with _his own_ conception of the journal's tasks. It does not matter which way we look at the issue. What matters, however, is that Feuerbach could not possibly supply what Marx expected or hoped to get from him.

The other letter is even more important in this respect. Written on the 11th of August 1844 - i.e., approximately at the time of the completion of the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ - it directly raises the question of the meaning of "man," the "unity of men with other men," and "the human species" [Menschengattung]. This is how Marx looks on these concepts, not _after_ his _Theses on Feuerbach_, not at the time of the _Communist Manifesto_, not in the course of the elaboration of his _Capital_, but right in the middle of 1844:

"In your writings you have given - _I do not know whether consciously or not_ - a philosophical foundation to socialism, and we communists at once have _understood your works in this sense_. The unity of men with other men, which is based on the real differences between men, _the concept of the human species_ brought down from the sky of abstraction to the real ground of earth, _what else is it if not the concept of society."_[[217]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#217)

These considerations are in full agreement with _Marx's_ own use of the discussed terms in the Paris Manuscripts, but they could hardly be further removed from _Feuerbach's_ concepts. Marx puts _his_ interpretation of these concepts to Feuerbach - on the occasion of posting to him a published copy of the _Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right_ - in the hope of starting a fruitful exchange of ideas with him. The distance was, as Feuerbach realized reading Marx's letter and the _Introduction_, far too great to be bridged, and he never followed up the offer.

As a matter of fact Marx himself was well aware of the qualitative difference between his own aspirations and Feuerbach's actual achievements. Already in the _Introduction_ he made it clear that the Feuerbachian criticism is only a _necessary preliminary_ to the fundamental task, the "criticism of earth" as he put it. In the _Manuscripts of 1844_ he was fully engaged in the theoretical realization of this task which necessarily implied a radical departure from Feuerbach's sphere to its real socioeconomic basis. (Only in his criticism of the Hegelian philosophy could Marx use Feuerbach more extensively, as a positively superseded "moment" of his own incomparably more comprehensive general conception).

Also, almost every single point Marx made in his _Theses on Feuerbach_, in the first months of 1845, can be found in the _Manuscripts of 1844_, even though without explicit critical references to Feuerbach himself. That he made efforts to take Feuerbach with him in carrying out an enterprise he considered to be the logical continuation of Feuerbach's necessary preliminaries, was thoroughly consistent with his general outlook; these efforts, therefore, should not be considered as merely tactical steps. Equally, the next logical step for Marx was - after seeing the failure of his efforts to enlist Feuerbach's active help in the cause of a radical practical criticism of society - to make the formerly implicit criticism explicit on Feuerbach as well, all the more because Marx's adversaries made great use of the Feuerbachian line of reasoning. (Marx's attitude towards some of his other contemporaries was very similar, but this did not make him share their views and illusions. He always tried to carry them with him on the road _he_ had chosen, but did not hesitate to take the criticism to its utmost once this proved impossible when his former friends ideologically lined themselves up with his political adversaries).

Thus the point of contact between Marx and Feuerbach at the time of writing the _Manuscripts of 1844_ is more _terminological_ than anything else. Terminological in Marx's sense, of course: i.e. implying that even a mystified terminology reflects a problem of reality that ought to be grasped in its proper setting. In other words, this kind of terminological contact should not be crudely simplified as "lip-service" or mere "tactics." It follows from Marx's historical-structural principle that one's method of setting out from the available, to greater or lesser extent mystified, terms is not only admissible but also necessary. It is, in fact, the only way in which it is possible to grasp the dialectical movement of ideas as concrete genesis, provided they are related to their real basis in the course of their concrete demystification.

In _The German Ideology_ Marx identified the reason why his efforts at enlisting Feuerbach's support had to fail:

"In reality and for the _**practical** materialist_, i.e. the _communist_, it is a question of revolutionizing the _existing world, of practically attacking_ and changing _existing things_. When _occasionally_ we find such views with Feuerbach, they are never more than _isolated surmises_ and have much too little influence on his general outlook to be considered here as anything else than _embryos capable of development_."[[218]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#218)

At the time of writing the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ Marx did not realize that these "embryos" were not capable of development by Feuerbach himself. But who could deduce from this fact the conclusion that in 1844 Marx himself was not a "_practical_ materialist" engaged in realizing his program of "revolutionizing the existing world, of practically attacking and changing existing things"? He did not realize, in 1844, that the _occasional_ remarks in Feuerbach's philosophy concerning the "practical criticism of the existing world" were only _"isolated surmises"_ leading to no practical consequence whatsoever. But who could deduce from this fact the conclusion that consequently for Marx too the idea of a "practical criticism of earth" was nothing but an "isolated surmise"? Feuerbach could not possibly accept Marx's offers precisely because in his philosophy the idea of a practical attack on existing things was peripheral and partial: never embracing the totality of the sociopolitical system, for he simply did not have the concept of the social relations of production. To find out about the real limits of the Feuerbachian philosophy, to find out how far he himself was capable of developing the isolated "embryos" of his system, it was necessary to try to enlist his active support for the practical task of radically attacking the existing order of society and its supporters, like old Schelling. That Feuerbach could not meet Marx's expectations is not surprising in the light of these limitations of which we are all now aware. But to suggest that Marx shared in the least the same limitations in 1844 - or indeed in 1843 when he first wrote to Feuerbach - means to take no notice whatsoever of the young Marx's efforts at radicalizing this "contemplative materialist," not to speak of ignoring the evidence of Marx's philosophical works themselves.

It may be argued that Marx had illusions about Feuerbach in 1844. It would be, however, an elementary logical error to equate Marx's illusions _about_ Feuerbach with _Feuerbach's own_ illusions. Yet it is precisely this error which we encounter when we are told that Marx's concept of man in the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ is the Feuerbachian "generic man."

(3) The concept of alienation is eminently a concept of synthesis. This means, among other things, that the word "alienation" is not necessarily required when the complex problematics covered by it is presented or developed in a detailed form. To take an example, let us consider the following passage from _Wage-Labor and Capital [Lohnarbeit und Kapital]_:

"But the exercise of labor power, labor, is the worker's own life-activity, the manifestation of his own life. And this _life-activity_ he sells to another person in order to secure the necessary _means of subsistence_. Thus this life-activity is for him only a means to enable him to exist. He works in order to live. He does not even reckon labor as part of his life, it is rather a sacrifice of his life. It is a commodity which he has made over to another. Hence, also, the product of his activity is not the object of his activity. What he produces for himself is not the silk that he weaves, not the gold that he draws from the mine, not the palace that he builds. What he produces for himself is _wages_, and silk, gold, palace resolve themselves for him into a definite quantity of the means of subsistence, perhaps into a cotton jacket, some copper coins and a lodging in a cellar. And the worker, who for twelve hours weaves, spins, drills, turns, builds, shovels, breaks stones, carries loads, etc. - does he consider this twelve hours' weaving, spinning, drilling, turning, building, shoveling, stone breaking as a manifestation of his life, as life? On the contrary, life begins for him where this activity ceases, at table, in the public house, in bed. The twelve hours' labor, on the other hand, has no meaning for him as weaving, spinning, drilling, etc., but as _earnings_, which bring him to the table, to the public house, into bed. If the silk worm were to spin in order to continue its existence as a caterpillar, it would be a complete wage-worker."[[219]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#219)

Here we have some of the most fundamental aspects of alienation as seen in the _Manuscripts of 1844_ - from "selling one's life-activity" to asserting that "life-activity becomes a mere means of existence" and to saying that the perceptible world, because of the external character of labor, is not appropriated by man in a direct sensuous form which would be ontologically appropriate, but is mediated by abstract "wages," as a result of the transformation of labor power into a commodity - and yet, the _word_ "alienation" is never mentioned.

There may have been a number of particular reasons for this, such as (a) Marx's deliberate policy of avoiding any resemblance to "true socialism" which abused the word; (b) the fact that the public to which _Wage-Labor and Capital_ was presented - first as a series of lectures in the Workers' Club in Brussels and later in the form of newspaper articles in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung - was not at all familiar with the extremely complex philosophical problematics of "Entfremdung" and "Entäußerung".

Nevertheless what keeps the various phenomena conceptually together in this analysis is the underlying concept of alienation as their focal point or common denominator. One must distinguish between _conception_ and _presentation_. It is simply unthinkable to conceive the Marxian vision without this fundamental concept of alienation. But once it is conceived in its broadest outlines - in the _Manuscripts of 1844_ - it becomes possible to let the general term "recede" in the _presentation_. Moreover, in order to work out in the most concrete form the manifold specific aspects of this comprehensive vision, it becomes also imperative to find those particular terms which adequately express the specific features of the particular spheres, levels, mediations, etc. of the overall problematics. The concrete articulation of the comprehensive vision cannot possibly be carried out by using always the same general term: doing this would not only result in endless repetitions but, ultimately, in a colossal tautology as well. Thus the receding of the general term in the course of the concrete elaboration of the complex problematics of alienation should not be mistaken for abandoning the concept itself.

The notion of alienation has something about it that could be described as a _"shorthand"_ character. It can, legitimately, comprehend a great deal and, therefore, it is eminently suitable to serve the purposes of quickly surveying and summarizing for one's own use a broad synthesis. But formulating the broad outlines of a synthesis is not the end of the task, only its real beginning. This outline or preliminary synthesis must be rendered specific enough in every respect, otherwise the practical realization of the philosophical program inherent in this synthesis cannot be seriously contemplated for a moment. It is in the course of this articulation or "rendering concrete" of the broad preliminary synthesis that the term "alienation" must be replaced in numerous contexts. This is why it is not at all surprising to find that the works which followed the _Manuscripts of 1844_, up to about 1856 - and written for publication - are far less densely populated with the word "alienation" than the first broad synthesis.

If, however, the reader has doubts about this interpretation, he should consult Marx's _Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie: Rohentwurf_ [Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy: Rough Draft] - a work written between 1857 and 1858 - and he should compare this work with its incomplete articulation in the three volumes of _Capital_. The _Rohentwurf_ is Marx's second broad synthesis whose conception was made necessary by the enormous wealth of material he had accumulated between 1844 and 1856. When he was trying to integrate this material into a coherent whole, the notion of alienation again pushed itself into the foreground and maintained its massive presence throughout the whole manuscript. (The length of this _Rohentwurf_ is many times that of the _Manuscripts of 1844_). While in the _Rohentwurf_ the term "alienation" occurs in _innumerable_ contexts, in _Capital_ it occupies a _relatively_ modest place. This second broad synthesis - it must be made explicit, in order to avoid misunderstandings - is in no way _opposed_ to the _Manuscripts of 1844_: it is only incomparably richer and more concretely comprehensive. In fact the _Rohentwurf_ is the fully articulated equivalent of the early system in statu nascendi. It is probably the greatest single theoretical monument of Marx's life.

(4) One of the striking features of Marx's work is that, despite the immense labor that went into them, _all_ his major works remained unfinished. Not only the _Manuscripts of 1844_ but also the _Theories of Surplus-Value_; not only the _Rohentwurf_ but also - as is sometimes forgotten - his _Capital_. This cannot be explained simply by the circumstances of his life, however hard these might have been.

The cause lies deeper, in the innermost nature of his work, inseparable from his conception of superseding philosophy, political economy, etc. by a comprehensively integrated, empirically founded and practically tested and realized "science of man." There is something subjectively self-defeating about this ideal of comprehensiveness. In its origins it goes back to Hegel who not only formulated it as a program but also carried it out in his monumental - though of course speculative - philosophical synthesis. However, to achieve such a synthesis in an idealistic form is a task radically different from Marx's aim of elaborating the general framework of a unified human science which integrates all the real accomplishments of human knowledge with the practical requirements of human life. If, in the idealistic system, there are gaps, the Weltgeist is always at hand to fill them in: the more congenially so the bigger these gaps and cleavages are. In Marx's vision, however, according to which the whole enterprise must be carried out "on earth," with means that can be put to practical tests, the realization of the program requires, among other things, the highest degree of development in all fields of science. If, therefore, some of the necessary conditions of the non-speculative generalizations are absent, the thinker cannot legitimately resort to a new speculative device but has to sit down and work out the problems for himself, no matter how much time-wasting research is involved in this effort. Besides, the more comprehensive his grasp becomes the more he must realize the inevitable gaps due to the always larger and more comprehensive interconnections. Also, every new fundamental achievement in the particular fields requires the thorough revision of the picture as a whole which in its turn again enlarges the previous limits of particular research. And this mutual interaction and reciprocal enrichment goes on indefinitely, for only ideally can the two poles merge into each other.

The task, in this Marxian vision, is clearly beyond the power of any particular individual, no matter how great he might be. The unfinished character of the work of synthesis thus inevitably follows from this new vision of synthesis itself, and in this sense it may be called subjectively self-defeating. In another sense, however, this vision provides a challenging task for generations to follow. A task of coming nearer, in the course of the reciprocal integration of theory and practice, to the Marxian ideal: through constant reformulations and supersessions of previous efforts, even though - by the very nature of the whole enterprise which implies a constantly renewed practical interchange with a constantly changing practice - never definitively realizing it.

#### 4. Theory of alienation and philosophy of history

Marx's theory of alienation is his "philosophy of history." Not in the sense of a specialized branch of philosophy that operates with concepts which are of no relevance to any other sphere, but as the reflection of a dynamic movement which is at the basis of all of them.

The concepts of "alienation" and "transcendence" are closely interrelated and thus if someone speaks of history in terms of alienation, he cannot justifiably forget about the problem of its transcendence. As soon as one realizes this, a vital issue arises: what does one mean by the supersession or transcendence of alienation?

Nowhere is the danger of misunderstanding and misinterpretation greater than precisely in this context. Especially if there are - and where are there not? - social contingencies that could tempt people to adopt a self-complacently distorted view. The dream of the "golden age" did not originate yesterday and is most unlikely to disappear tomorrow.

It would go against the spirit of Marx's general conception to settle the problem of "Aufhebung", once and forever, in the fairytale form of a Utopian golden age. In Marx's vision - which cannot recognize anything as _absolutely final_ - there can be no place for a utopian golden age, neither "round the corner" nor astronomical distances away. Such a golden age would be an end of history, and thus the end of man himself.

Yet the fact remains that not only Marx's enemies but also many of his followers and vulgarizers identified him with the prophet of a promised land, and some even have claimed to have realized - or of being very near to the realization of - his alleged idea of a promised land. There are, of course, sentences in Marx which, if taken in isolation, can be construed as supporting such claims. Moreover there is the additional, and more serious, difficulty that Marx - despising the occupation of daydreaming about the future - did not anticipate in explicit form the rejection of these approaches.

Because of this lack of explicitness the answer to the question of a transcendence of alienation must be "worked out" from some of Marx's fundamental concepts. To mention just two of them:

1. _"Aufhebung"_ necessarily implies not only the supersession of any given form of alienation but also the "preservation" of some of its "moments";

2. _"historische Notwendigkeit"_ means not only that social phenomena are established historically and cannot be fictitiously dreamed away from the historical stage but also that all particular stages of human history _necessarily disappear_, because to be a historical necessity is to be a necessarily disappearing necessity (_eine verschwindende Notwendigkeit_). It is not difficult to see, therefore, that to posit a utopian "golden age" as a "verschwindende Notwendigkeit" is a contradiction in terms.

Nevertheless this does not mean that, with a summary reference to these and similar concepts, one could consider settled the complicated problems that arise in connection with the "Aufhebung" of alienation. What is important is to separate the genuine difficulties from their mystifications in bourgeois philosophy.

As we have seen Hegel, representing "the standpoint of political economy," identified _alienation_ with _objectification_, thus precluding the possibility of an _actual_, practical transcendence of alienation. Understandably, therefore, this is the one and only Hegelian idea which has met with the wholehearted approval of all trends of bourgeois philosophy in the twentieth century. Since this was the crucial point of difference between Marx and Hegel, the modern irrationalistic re-edition of the Hegelian idea could be eminently used against Marx, or indeed sometimes in support of an existentialistically mystified interpretation of Marx. In the twentieth century Marx could not be ignored any longer. The best way to neutralize his intellectual impact was, therefore, an existentialists interpretation of his thought which consisted basically in the mystification of the historically specific - anticapitalist - conception of alienation. Accordingly, the concept of alienation gained an incomparably greater significance in the writings of twentieth century existentialists than in those of their forefather, Kierkegaard himself.[[220]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#220) Heidegger, for instance, defines Marx's importance like this: "Because Marx, through his experience of the _alienation of modern man_, is aware of a _fundamental dimension of history_, the Marxist view of history is superior to all other views."[[221]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#221) Needless to say, Marx did not experience alienation as "the alienation of modern man," but as the alienation of man in capitalist society. Nor did he look upon alienation as a "fundamental dimension of history," but as the central issue of a given _phase_ of history. Heidegger's interpretation of Marx's conception of alienation is thus revealing not about Marx, but about his own very different approach to the same issue.

The same attempt is expressed, in a less subtle form, in Jean Hyppolite's discussion of the relationship between alienation and history. He writes, with direct reference to Marx's criticism of the Hegelian identification of alienation and objectification: "L'auteur de la _Phénoménologie_, de _l'Encyclopédie_, de la _Philosophie de l'histoire_, n'a pas confondu l'aliénation de l'esprit humain dans l'histoire avec l'objectivation sans quelques raisons valables, autres que celles qu'on peut découvrir dans la structure économique de l'époque et dans l'état du systeme capitaliste. Que l'homme, en s'objectivant dans la culture, dans l'Etat, dans l'ouvre humaine en général, en meme temps s'aliene, se fasse autre et découvre dans cette objectivation une altérité insurmontable et qu'il faut pourtant tenter de surmonter, c'est la une _tension inséparable de l'existence_, et le mérite de Hegel est d'avoir insisté sur cette tension, de l'avoir conservée au centre meme de la conscience de soi humaine. Une des grandes difficultés du marxisme est par contre de prétendre supprimer cette tension dans un avenir plus ou moins proche, de l'expliquer trop rapidement par une phase particuliere de l'histoire. Tel quel, ce concept ne nous paraît pas réductible au seul concept d'aliénation de l'homme dans le capital comme l'interprete Marx. Ce n'est la qu'un cas particulier d'un probleme plus universel qui est celui de la conscience de soi humaine, qui, incapable de se penser comme un cogito séparé, ne se trouve que dans le monde qu'elle édifie, dans les autres moi qu'elle reconnaît et ou parfois elle se méconnaît. Mais cette façon de se trouver dans l'autre, cette objectivation est toujours plus ou moins une aliénation, une _perte de soi en meme temps qu'une découverte de soi_. Ainsi objectivation et aliénation sont inséparables et leur unité ne peut etre que l'expression d'une tension dialectique qu'on aperçoit dans le mouvement meme de l'histoire".[[222]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#222)

Thus Hyppolite interprets alienation as a tension inséparable de l'existence and as necessarily inherent in the very nature of "human self-consciousness" [la conscience de soi humaine]. This is an idealistic mystification which condemns all attempts directed at a practical transcendence of alienation to the fate of a Quixotic enterprise. Hyppolite's ultimate premise is the arbitrarily assumed anti-dialectical concept of a so-called "altérité insurmontable" (insurmountable otherness) which he couples with an equally arbitrary, irrational _"Sollen": "qu'il faut_ pourtant _tenter_ de surmonter" ("one ought, nevertheless, to try and surmount it").

Such an enterprise is no more meaningful than "trying" to rewrite - in the very last second of one's life - Tolstoy's _War and Peace_. Attempts make no sense whatsoever if they are _a priori_ condemned to failure. As we have seen, "ought" played a major role also in Rousseau's concept of alienation. The difference, however, could not be more radical. Rousseau's "ought," expressing an objective contradiction of which the philosopher himself was not aware, was meant to have an actual impact on reality, in order to remove the existing alienations. Here, by contrast, the basic premise is a willing acceptance and glorification of an alleged "altérité insurmontable" as a "tension inséparable de l'existence". Consequently the "ought" which is brought into this picture cannot be other than an absurd, irrationalistic, empty "ought" whose only function is to give a "moral respectability" to a crude apology for the capitalistically alienated social relations of production. What is at fault here is not the use of a moral category but its mystifying _abuse_ in support of the existing, dehumanized order of society.

It goes without saying, there is a grain of truth in these interpretations, otherwise they could hardly succeed in their mystificatory function. Their methodology is characterized by the exaggeration of this element of truth out of all proportion, so that - by suppressing the complex dialectical interconnections as well as by removing the concrete socio-historical references - it is turned into a grave distortion. The main effort is directed at obscuring even the visible lines of demarcation, instead of aiming at the elaboration of those specific concepts which could highlight the objective differences that are veiled by the reification of the existing social relations of production.

There is some truth in asserting that alienation and objectification are "plus ou moins inséparables". But the validity of statements of this kind depends entirely on the philosopher's ability to specify, both conceptually and socio-historically, his terms of reference. Here, however, we are not given any concretization whatsoever. On the contrary, the vague generality of "plus ou moins" serves the purpose of both exempting the philosopher from the task of concretization and at the same time of creating the semblance of a proper assessment.

Moreover, inseparability of alienation and objectification only applies if one treats "objectification" as a homogeneous category which it is not. One must distinguish, at least, between objectification manifesting itself in the form of objects such as tables, chairs, etc., and objectification taking the form of human institutions. There is no reason why tables etc. should be considered as inseparable from alienation. Objects of this kind can certainly assume institutional functions - when, e.g. the solemn managerial desk also helps to carry out the function of keeping the distance from the man who is ceremoniously shown in to sit down behind it. But the "alienation" involved is not due to the existence of desks as human objectifications but to their _institutional functions_ which can be changed.

It is different with objectification as _institutionalization_. Totally and definitively to abolish alienation in this respect would imply the total abolition of human institutions, while we do not need to abolish desks to remove their alienated institutional functions. But what the total abolition of human institutions would amount to is, paradoxically, not the abolition of alienation but its _maximization_ in the form of total anarchy, and thus the abolition of _humanness_. "Humanness" implies the opposite of anarchy: _order_ which, in human society, is inseparable from some _organization_. Even "conscious association" - no matter how conscious it might be - is inconceivable without having some specific form, and this form, for human beings, cannot be other than some kind of institution set up on the basis of some guiding principles. And even if we take the ideal case - when the underlying guiding principle is conscious guarding against any possible petrification or "reification" - the fact still remains that the specific form of association has to deal with specific tasks which will also determine the character of the institution in question. But this last - inescapable - fact means that the given new form of institution which has just superseded a reified structure contains - from the first moment of its existence and not merely in its dying-out stages - an element of reification, insofar as it is _necessarily biased_ against the tasks it is _incapable_ of fulfilling.

To do away completely with this difficulty one would have to postulate either the absolute finality of certain tasks (i.e. "ideal tasks" - that is, the end of history or a utopian "golden age") or the absolute finality of an institution (i.e. the "ideal institution" which could ideally solve all possible tasks - such an ideal institution would not and could not have any specific form and, of course, it could not solve any specific task whatsoever). For such postulates, however, one would also have to invent a being to fit in them: a being whose needs, tasks, functions, etc., never change, or a being who has no needs, tasks, functions, etc. at all.

Another important aspect of this problem is that, no matter how conscious human efforts to eliminate all possible contradictions between the individual and the given form of society may be, an element of potential alienation is always involved. In this connection we can only briefly refer to two aspects of this complex problematics:

1. A necessary precondition for any individual to acquire _his_ personality is to be in a multiplicity of relations with _other_ people, using, for self-development, the means and tools he is _given_ (at least up to a certain point of independence and maturity), and trying out his _own_ forces insofar as he is capable of identifying them in a reciprocal interchange with others, provided that they are noticeably present in some form in his fellow men. To abolish, absolutely and definitively, all elements of alienation and reification in this respect would, again, be only possible by idealizing these relations to such an extent that they would sharply contradict all possible relations between the real individual and society.

2. One of the striking features of this problem is that for the individual - whether he is conscious of it or not - his own self-realization is, in the first place, necessarily a task of fitting into the existing and available (but of course not created specifically for him) roles and functions. Later he may be able to enlarge their limits or to break out of them if they are incapable of adaptation and if his strength to break out encounters no defeating resistance. Nevertheless the problem remains that the individual can realize his own powers only if he has outlets for them, if, that is, his fellow-men are able and willing to take what he has to offer.

Also, the relationship between society and technology is not free from problems with serious implications. In a letter to Annenkov (28 Dec. 1846) Marx made the important distinction between technology and its socially determined application. This distinction, however, cannot mean that technology itself is _totally_ neutral in this respect, for all determinants are also themselves determined.[[223]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#223)

Technology is neutral _in principle_, but a given form of _established_ technology is not. Every form of technology has its limits not only in the quantity of its products but also - and this is the relevant point here - in the _quality_ of human needs it is best suited to satisfy. This implies the danger of distorting the whole range of human needs in the direction of the "minimum resistance," or the "optimal allocation of human resources," etc., which in its turn - since consumption reaches back to production - can again enhance those potentials of the given technology which in the first place tended to produce seriously distorting effects. Evidently against this danger one has to appeal to social priorities, involving a most thorough examination of the whole complexity of human needs. In this sort of examination and assessment the tasks facing any form of society must be formulated also in terms of a constant struggle against the alienating potentials of technology.

All these problems, nevertheless, are capable of a solution, though of course only of a dialectical one. In our assessment of the transcendence of alienation it is vitally important to keep the "timeless" aspects of this problematics in their proper perspectives. Otherwise they can easily become ammunition for those who want to glorify capitalist alienation as a "tension inséparable de l'existence".

What the problems described above really amount to can be summed up as follows:

1. that no _a priori_ safeguards and assurances can be given for a practical supersession of alienation, since the issues involved are themselves inherently socio-historical;

2. that there are some _dangers_ of alienation which are inherent in the reifying _potential_ of certain instruments and institutions of human interchange;

3. and that no achievement in this respect (however radical and important) can be considered an _absolutely definitive_ (permanent) "Aufhebung" of all possible forms of alienation.

Dangers, nevertheless, can be controlled, at least in principle. And this is precisely what is denied by the mystifiers who first make history stop arbitrarily at its capitalist phase, characterized by an actual lack of control, and then conclude that human "objectifications" are uncontrollable in principle. They misrepresent _dangers_ and alienating _potentials_ as _metaphysical necessities_ (by calling alienation a "tension inséparable de l'existence", a "fundamental dimension of history," etc.) in order to justify the existing, socio-historically specific and transcendable _actuality_ of capitalist alienation as an inescapable, _absolute necessity_. Thus in opposition to the dynamic, socio-historically concrete, dialectical ontology of Marx they offer a frozen, metaphysical, antihistorical, "phenomenological" pseudo-ontology. To say that "alienation is a fundamental dimension of history" is to negate history altogether. An "ontology" based on the foundations of such a negation is nothing but a mystifying projection of capitalist alienation and reification on a "timeless" scale.

The alienating potentials inherent in the instruments and institutions of human intercourse can be controlled provided that they are recognized _as_ instruments and consciously brought into relation with _human ends_. And this is where we can identify what is really at stake and in what way and form is the socio-historically specific, capitalist, alienation involved in the matter. For it is not in the "ontological" nature of the instruments themselves that they get "out of control" and turn from _means_ into self-sustaining _ends_. It is not the ontologically fundamental first order mediation between man and nature that is at stake here (i.e. not the fact that human beings have to produce in order to survive, and that no production is conceivable without instruments of some kind) but the _capitalist_ form of _second order mediations_. Human instruments are not uncontrollable under capitalism because they are _instruments_ (it is a sheer mystification to say that they represent an "altérité insurmontable" because they are distinct from "human self-consciousness" ["la conscience de soi humaine"]) but because they are the instruments - specific, reified second order mediations - of _capitalism_. As such they cannot possibly function, except in a "reified" form; if, that is, they _control_ man instead of being controlled by him. It is, therefore, not their _universal_ characteristic of being instruments that is directly involved in alienation but their _specificity_ of being instruments of a certain _type_. It is indeed one of the _differentia specifica_ of capitalistic instruments that they represent an "altérité insurmontable" to the "conscience de soi humaine" which is incapable of controlling them. Precisely because they are capitalistic second order mediations - the fetish character of commodity, exchange and money; wage-labor; antagonistic competition; internal contradictions mediated by the bourgeois state; the market; the reification of culture; etc. - it is necessarily inherent in their "essence" of being "mechanisms of control" that they must elude human control. This is why they must be _radically_ superseded: the "expropriators must be expropriated"; "the bourgeois state must be overthrown"; antagonistic competition, commodity-production, wage-labor, the market, money-fetishism must be eliminated; the bourgeois hegemony of culture must be broken, etc. Consequently the program of superseding capitalist alienation can be concretized as the replacement of the uncontrollable, reified instruments of capitalism by controllable instruments of human interchange. For in the very moment in which man succeeds in consciously subordinating his instruments to the realization of _his own ends_ their "altérité insurmontable" _is surmounted_.

It goes without saying, a radical transformation of this magnitude cannot happen overnight. The "expropriation of the expropriators" is no more than the first act of a long and immensely complex process of change, characterized by the dialectic of "continuity in discontinuity" and "discontinuity in continuity." Granting that it is unthinkable to supersede alienation in a form that could be considered as absolutely and definitely superseding all possible dangers and potentials of reification, is fully compatible with conceiving "Aufhebung" as a succession of social enterprises of which the later is _less_ (indeed _qualitatively_ less) alienation-ridden than the preceding one. What matters is not only the given amount and extent of something you fight against - as criminologists know all too well - but also the general _trend_ of development of the phenomenon in question. Capitalism is not characterized simply by alienation and reification but, at the same time, also by the _maximization_ of the _trend_ of alienation, to the point where the very existence of mankind is now at stake.

What gives sense to human enterprise in socialism is not the fictitious promise of a fictitious absolute (a world from which all possible contradiction is eliminated for ever) but the _real_ possibility of turning a menacingly _increasing_ trend of alienation into a reassuringly _decreasing_ one. This itself would already be a _qualitative_ achievement on the road to an effective, practical supersession of alienation and reification. But further qualitative achievements are possible which can be pinpointed not only in terms of the _reversal_ of the general trend itself but also as regards the substantially different - self-fulfilling - character of specific forms of human activity which are freed from their subjection to alienated means serving the purpose of the perpetuation of the reified social relations of production.

The substitution of consciously controlled instruments and means of human interchange for the existing, capitalistically alienated and reified "second order mediations" is the socio-historically concrete program of this transcendence. As to the "timeless" aspects of the dangers inherent in the instruments themselves, as we have seen they are not timeless at all because mere _potentialities_ cannot become _realities_ without the practical intervention of socio-historically _always_ specific forms of human agency. Whether or not such potentialities remain mere potentialities or become dehumanizing realities depends entirely on the specific nature of the intervening human agency. If, therefore, the capitalistically alienated second order mediations - which are _a priori_, by their "essence," incompatible with human control - are abolished and replaced by instruments devised for the realization of consciously adopted human aims, then whatever dangers and potentials of alienation may present themselves at any stage of history, they must, in principle, be capable of human mastery and control.

History, therefore, in the Marxian conception remains history, which means simply that the instruments and forms of human interchange are conceived by Marx as inherently historical, changing, socio-historically specific - at any stage whatsoever of human development.[[224]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/meszaro8.htm#224) And this is the point where we can clearly see the _practical_ implications of the difference between an "open" and a "closed" system discussed elsewhere in general terms at the end of Chapter 3.

Marx opposes to the actual, practical mystification of capitalism - which is only _reflected_ in an alienated form in the various philosophical rationalizations of the _practical_ negation of history by capitalism - the openness of his conception: the assertion of a "historicité insurmontable" of human existence. By contrast the Hegelian categories were mere concepts, logical abstractions; - therefore their "historicity," too, was a "speculative" one, i.e. _terminable_ at the point which represented the socio-historical limits of the philosopher's standpoint. ("The standpoint of political economy"). Indeed, since Hegel was operating with logical abstractions as his categories, his category of historicity too had to be introduced into his conception in the form of a logical abstraction, a mere concept. And just as easily - and arbitrarily - as one speculatively _introduces_ the category of historicity into such a system, just as easily one can bring to an end the whole "abstract, speculative, logical" process. This is why in the end the Hegelian conception of teleology must turn out to be a peculiar version of _theological teleology_. And a "historical ontology" which is based on a theological theology is not only a closed, speculative, pseudo-historical system but also a _metaphysical_ ontology.

By contrast the Marxian ontology is dynamically historical and objectively dynamic. Marx does not "deduce" human society from the "categories" but, on the contrary, sees the latter as specific modes of existence of the social being. He does not "add" historicity to an originally static vision; for if historicity is merely added at a certain point it can be also taken away at another. Instead he defines the ontological substance of his conception as "the _self-mediating_ being of _nature_," i.e. as an _objective_ being who cannot help being _inherently historical_.

Man, in the Marxian conception, is not a "dimension of history" but, on the contrary, human _history_ is a dimension of man as a self-mediating objective being of nature. Only an objective being can be historical, and an objective being can only be historical. History is a meaningless abstraction unless it is related to an objective being. In this dual sense history is, therefore, a dimension of man as an objective, self-mediating being of nature.

If, however, history is a dimension of man, alienation cannot be "a fundamental dimension of history." Being a dimension of an objective being, history cannot have any dimension of its own - let alone one which is the direct _negation_ of all historicity. By turning alienation into "a fundamental dimension of history," Heidegger liquidates the historicity of an inherently historical, objective being. Insofar as alienation is a negation of humanness, it is characteristic of a certain _phase_ of history, of a certain _stage_ of development of the social ontology of the objective "self-mediating being of nature."

A phase which _perpetuates_ itself through the reification of the social relations of production and, insofar as it succeeds in this self-perpetuation, it _practically negates_ history, by opposing the power of the reified institutions of human interchange to all human efforts which aim at the replacement of the uncontrollable instruments of capitalism. This actual, _practical negation_ of history by the capitalistically reified social relations of production is mystified by Heidegger and others, in their effort to transfer the socio-historically specific phenomena of capitalist alienation and reification to the eternal, "fundamental," metaphysical plane of an anti-historical, frozen ontology. This is why time and history must be "substantialized" and given some fictitious "fundamental dimensions": so that man should be deprived of _his_ historical dimension and confronted, instead, with the uncontrollable power of a mythical "history" equated with an alleged metaphysical "eternality" and "fundamentality" of alienation in the pseudo-historical "thrownness" ["Geworfenheit"] of human existence.

In the Marxian conception - against which all these mystifications are directed - both alienation and its transcendence must be defined in terms of the objective necessities that characterize the _objective social ontology_ of the "self-mediating being of nature." The necessity of alienation is defined as a necessity inherent in the objective teleology of human "self-development and self-mediation" at a certain stage of development of human productive activity which requires such alienation and reification for the - however alienated - self-realization of human potentialities. Since this necessity of alienation is a _historical_ necessity, it is bound to be superseded [aufgehoben] through the concrete historical development of the same productive activity, provided that:

1. the development of the productive forces _allows_ the radical negation of capitalistic alienation;

2. that the ripening of the social contradictions of capitalism (in the closest interchange with the development of the productive forces) _compels_ man to move in the direction of an "Aufhebung";

3. that the insights of human beings into the objective characteristics of their instruments _enable_ them to elaborate those forms of control and interchange which prevent the reproduction of the old contradictions in some new form;

4. and that the radical transformation of education from being a mere instrument of bourgeois hegemony into an organ of self-development and conscious self-mediation _inspires_ the individuals to produce "according to their real human capabilities" - _unifying_ knowledge and ideals, design and execution, theory and practice, as well as _integrating_ the particular aspirations of the social individuals into the consciously adopted general aims of society as a whole.

The transcendence of alienation thus cannot be measured merely in terms of production _per capita_, or anything like that. Since the whole process directly involves the individual, the "measure" of success can hardly be other than the real human individual himself.

In terms of such a measure, the transcendence of alienation - its decreasing hold over men - is in an inverse ratio to the increasingly fuller self-realization of the social individual. Since, however, the individual's self-realization cannot be abstracted from the society in which he lives, this question is inseparable from that of the concrete interrelations between individual and society or the types and forms of social institutions in which the individual may be able to integrate himself.

[206] _The German Ideology_: "As long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as long, therefore, as activity is not voluntarily, but naturally, divided, _man's own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him"_ (pgs. 44-45). "Just because individuals seek only their particular interest, which for them does not coincide with their communal interest (in fact the general is the illusory form of communal life), the latter will be imposed on them as an interest _'alien' to them, and 'independent' of them_, as in its turn a particular, peculiar 'general' interest; or they themselves must remain within this discord, as in democracy" (pg. 46). "With the communist regulation of production (and, implicit in this, _the destruction of the alien relation between men and what they themselves produce),_ the power of the relation of supply and demand is dissolved into nothing" (pg. 47). "In history up to the present it is certainly an empirical fact that separate individuals have, with the broadening of their activity into world-historical activity, become _more and more enslaved under a power alien to them"_ (pg. 49). _"Conditions_ which were previously abandoned to chance and _had won an independent existence over against the separate individuals_ just because of their separation as individuals, and because of the necessity of their combination which had been determined by the division of labor, and through their separation had become a bond alien to them. Thus, in imagination, individuals seem freer under the dominance of the bourgeoisie than before, because their conditions of life seem accidental; in reality, of course, _they are less free, because they are more subjected to the violence of things"_ (pgs. 95-96).

_Manifesto of the Communist Party_: "to command the labor of others" (i.e. to rule over alienated labor, ed. cit., p. 48). "Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of _the power to subjugate the labor of others_ by means of such appropriation" (pg. 49).

_Wage-Labor and Capital_: "To say that the most favorable condition for wage labor is the most rapid possible growth of productive capital is only to say that the more rapidly the working class increases and enlarges _the power that is hostile to it, the wealth that does not belong to it and that rules over it,_ the more favorable will be the conditions under which it is allowed to labor anew at increasing bourgeois wealth, at enlarging the power of capital, content with forging for itself the golden chains by which the bourgeoisie drags it in its train." (Selected Works, Vol. I, pg. 98).

_Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy_ [Grundrisse... Rohentwurf]: "The stress is not on being _objectified_, but on being _alienated_, externalized, estranged: on the fact that the immense objective power _set up by social labor_, as one of its moments, _over against itself_, does not belong to the worker but to the personified conditions of production, i.e. to capital. Inasmuch as at the standpoint of capital and wage-labor the production of this objective body of activity unfolds in opposition to direct labor-power - this process of objectification appears in fact as a _process of alienation_ from the standpoint of labor and as _appropriation of alien labor_ from the standpoint of capital - this perversion and overturning is _real_, not _imagined_: it does not merely exist in the mind of workers and capitalists. But obviously this process of overturning is only an historical _necessity_; it is a necessity for the development of the productive forces from a certain point of departure, or basis, but by no means an _absolute_ necessity of production as such; rather it is a disappearing necessity, and the result and end which is immanent in this process is the supersession of this basis and of this particular form of objectification. Bourgeois economists are so tied to the representations of a determinate historical stage of social development that in their eyes the necessary _objectification_ of labor's social powers is inseparable from the latter's necessary _**alienation** from living labor_. However, with the supersession of the _direct_ character of living labor as merely _individual_ - or as merely internally, or only externally universal - labor, with the constitution of the individuals' activity as _directly universal, i.e. **social** activity_, the objective moments of production will be freed of this _form of alienation_; they will be constituted as property, as the _organic body of society_ in which the individuals reproduce themselves as individuals, but _as social individuals_."

_Theories of Surplus-Value_: "The rich have taken possession of all the conditions of production; [hence] the _alienation of the conditions of production_, which in their simplest form are the natural elements themselves" (Part I, translated by Emile Burns, Moscow, without date, pg. 335).

"_Interest_ in itself expresses precisely the being of the conditions of labor as _capital_ in its social opposition to labor, and its metamorphoses as personal powers over against labor. It sums up the _**alienated** character of the conditions of labor_ in relation to the activity of the subject. It represents the property of capital - i.e. mere capital-ownership - as a means to appropriate the products of alien labor, as rule over alien labor. But it represents this character of capital as something that comes from _outside_ the process of production, and not as the result of the specific determination of this process of production itself."

_Capital_: "the character of _independence and estrangement_ which the capitalist mode of production as a whole gives to the instruments of labor and to the product, as against the workman" (Vol. I, p. 432). "Since, before entering on the process, his own labor has already been _alienated from himself_ by the sale of his labor-power, has been appropriated by the capitalist and incorporated with capital, it must, during the process, be realized in a product that does not belong to him. The laborer therefore constantly produces material, objective wealth, but in the form of capital, of an _alien power that dominates him_; and the capitalist as constantly produces labor-power, but in the form of a subjective source of wealth, separated from the objects in and by which it can alone be realized; in short he produces the laborer, but as a wage-laborer" (Vol. I, pgs. 570-571). "Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labor are brought about at the cost of the individual laborer; all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the producers; they mutilate the laborer into _a fragment of a man_, degrade him to the level of an _appendage of a machine_, destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil; they _estrange from him the intellectual potentialities_ of the labor-process in the same proportion as _science_ is incorporated in it as an _independent power_." (Vol. I, pg. 645.) "These means of production are in opposition to the owner of the labor-power, being _property of another_ [fremdes Eigentum]. On the other hand the seller of labor faces its buyer as _labor-power of another_ [fremde Arbeitskraft]" (Vol. II, pg. 29). "This conception is so much the less surprising since it appears to accord with fact, and since the relationship of capital actually conceals the inner connection behind the _utter indifference, isolation, and alienation_ in which they place the laborer vis-a-vis the means incorporating his labor." (Vol. III, p. 84.)

"However, it is not only the _alienation_ and indifference that arise between the laborer, the bearer of living labor, and the economical, i.e., rational and thrifty, use of the material conditions of his labor." (Vol. III, p. 86.) "Capital comes more and more to the fore as a social power... It becomes _an alienated, independent social power, which stands opposed to society as an object_ [Sache], and as an object that is the capitalist's source of power." (Vol. III, p. 259.) "But under this system _separation of the producer from the means of production_ [Entfremdung der Produktionsbedingung vom Produzenten] reflects an actual revolution in the mode of production itself" (Vol. III, p. 583).

.."On the other hand, it is just as natural for the actual agents of production to feel completely at home in these _estranged and irrational forms_ of capital - interest, land - rent, labor - wages, since these are precisely the forms of illusion in which they move about and find their daily occupation" (Vol. III, pgs. 809-810).

[209] R.C. Tucker, _Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx_ (Cambridge University Press, 1961), pg. 235, Tucker's book is worth a closer look as a characteristic ideological effort. His line of argument runs as follows. It is quite wrong to pay attention to Marx as an economist, sociologist or political thinker. His philosophy must be understood as a "moralism of the religious kind" (pg. 21). As such it ought to be traced back to German philosophy - notably Kant, Hegel, and Feuerbach - which displays a compulsive drive for "self-aggrandizement" and "self-infinitizing," i.e. a psychopathological aspiration of man to become God. We are told by Tucker that "What made Hegelianism irresistibly compelling to young Marx was the theme of man's soaring into the unlimited. _His own darkly proud and ambitious nature_, in which his worried father Heinrich discerned what he called a 'Faust-like spirit,' was _the key to his response_" (pg. 74). All this is said quite seriously. If Heinrich Marx discovers in his son a "Faust-like spirit," there must be something deeply wrong with the Faust-like spirit. "_The Faust-theme is pride_ in the sense of _self-glorification_ and the resulting search for _self-aggrandizement_" (pg. 31.) "Marx's main work is an _inner drama projected as a social drama_" (pg. 221) - but Marx deceives himself about its real nature. Just like Feuerbach - as Hegel before him - who did not realize that when he analyzed religion he was in fact talking about "_the neurotic phenomenon of human self-glorification or pride_, and the estrangement of the self that results from it" (pg. 93), Marx had no idea that in his presumed analysis of capitalism he unconsciously painted something resembling Robert Louis Stevenson's _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_: a purely psychological problem, related to an entirely "individual matter" (pg. 240). "Being a suffering individual himself, who had _projected upon the outer world an inner drama of oppression_, he saw suffering everywhere" (pg. 237); "_the inner conflict_ of alienated man with himself became, _in Marx's mind_, a social conflict between 'labor' and 'capital,' and the alienated species-self became the class-divided society. Self-alienation was _projected as a social phenomenon_, and Marx's _psychological original system_ turned into his _apparently_ sociological mature one" (pg. 175).

All this can be summed up in one sentence: Marx was a neurotic who - after experiencing the inner drama of his own darkly proud and ambitious personality and after expressing it in his original psychological system - succumbed to total self-deception and mythically projected his inner drama on the outside world, misleading people into believing that alienation was not an entirely individual matter but primarily a social problem with possible social solutions to it.

Tucker's book is full of inconsistencies and self-contradictions. One of them concerns the question: "Two Marxisms or One." We get contradictory answers to this question: (1) there are two Marxisms: "original Marxism" and "mature Marxism"; (2) there is one Marxism only; the differences are merely terminological; e.g. "'division of labor' becomes the comprehensive category of mature Marxism corresponding to the category 'self-alienation' in original Marxism" (pg. 185).

The so-called "original Marxism" is supposed to be an "openly subjectivistic, psychological original system." The most conspicuous difference between the "original" and the "mature system" is, we are told, that "self-alienated man, who was the central subject of original Marxism, disappears from view in the later version" (pg. 165). As regards the time of this alleged transformation we are given, again, contradictory answers. First we learn that it began "approximately with the statement of the Materialist Conception of History by Marx in _The German Ideology_ (1845-1846)" (pg. 165) and that "Marx put forward this thoroughly 'socialized' version of Marxism in the immediate _aftermath_ of his work on the manuscripts of 1844" (pg. 166). A few pages later, however, we are surprised with this statement: "The transition to the seemingly 'dehumanized' mature Marxism actually occurred at that point in the manuscripts of 1844 where Marx decided, uncertainly but irrevocably, that man's self-alienation could and should be grasped as a social relation 'of man to man'" (pg. 175). This statement contradicts not only the previous assertions but also an earlier reference to Marx's essay _On the Jewish Question_ (1843). There, after quoting Marx, Tucker added: "Marx concludes that the liberation of man from alienation in the state, unlike his liberation from religion, will require _a real social revolution_" (pg. 105). Now he wants us to believe that one year later, in his "psychological system" of 1844, Marx's concern with alienation was not at all social but merely psychological, having in mind _"the conflict of an alienated generic man with himself"_ (pg. 173).

The only place where Tucker makes an attempt at substantiating with quotations from Marx his own assertion that "man" means non-social "generic man" in the _Manuscripts of 1844_ is this: "Marx says that man is a natural being and must, like _any other natural being_, undergo a developmental process or act of becoming. This self-development process of man is the 'act of world history.' By 'man,' moreover, Marx means mankind or the human species, _following Feuerbach_. The act of world history is the self-realization of man in this collective or generic sense. Marx, of course, does not overlook (any more than Hegel did) the existence of individuals as parts of and participants in the _collective life of the species_. But the self-developing being of whom he speaks in his system is _man writ large in the species_. 'The individual life and species-life of man are _not distinct_,' he says, for 'the determinate individual is only a _determinate_ species being.' The life of the individual is a microcosm of _the life of man on the generic scale_. Accordingly, the 'man' of whom Marx speaks in his manuscripts is _understood as man in general_" (pgs. 129-130).

Understood by whom? Certainly not by Marx, for he maintains, on every single point of this quotation, the exact opposite of Tucker's assertions. He does not think that man must "undergo" a developmental process "_like_ any other natural being." On the contrary, he says that _unlike_ all the other natural beings man develops himself - creates himself - through his labor in society, and thus he is the _only_ being who has a _history_ of his own. Also, as we have already seen, Marx does not _follow_ Feuerbach in understanding by man "generic man" but, on the contrary, he radically departs from this abstraction and the dualism implicit in it. Nor does he believe that there is such a thing as the separate "collective life of the species" or "the life of man on the generic scale" (whatever that may mean). On the contrary, he insists that the difference amounts only to that of a "mode of existence" as reflected in human consciousness, and that the center of reference of the essential unity between the individual and the species is the "_real **individual**_ social being."

The passage from which Tucker quotes is full of expressions like "real community," "social fabric," "social being," "social life" and "social existence," but they are all carefully avoided by our learned author, in order to give a semblance of authenticity to the assertion according to which man means "generic man" in Marx's "psychological" and "openly subjectivistic original system." What Marx was actually concerned with in this passage (see _MSS of 1844_, pgs. 104-105, and T.B. Bottomore's translation, pgs. 158-159) was to point, in a direct criticism of abstract philosophizing, to the unity of thinking and being, the species and the individual, finding this unity, as we have seen, in the "real _individual_ social being" who is at the same time "a determinate species being." He did not say that they are not _"distinct"_ - otherwise how could they possibly form a dialectical _unity_: the lack of distinctness would amount to a simple _identity_. He only insisted that, since they are _not "different things"_ (Bottomore's translation, pg. 158), they should not be _opposed_ to each other. In other words, this is a rejection of the Hegelian solution which declares that the individual has to accept alienation in his actual life, for the supersession of alienation (i.e. the realization of species-life) is to be achieved merely in _thought_, not in _being_: in a fictitious "transcendence" of alienation which leaves the real existence of the particular individual as alienated as before. This is what Marx was talking about, fully engaged in formulating the question of superseding alienation as a _social program_ centered around man as a _"real individual social being,"_ in _opposition_ to the generic character of abstract philosophizing on the one hand and to "the reestablishing of 'society' as an abstraction vis-a-vis the individual" on the other.

There is no space to go on much longer with the discussion of the numerous inconsistencies and misinterpretations we find in Tucker's book. To the examples discussed so far we can only add his treatment of the problems of (1) the division of labor; and (2) "egoistic need" and "competition."

(1) We are told that Marx's concept of the division of labor is nothing but a "translation of the original psychological term: "self-alienation" into the mystified "apparently sociological" terms of "mature Marxism." This interpretation is untenable not only because "self-alienation" for Marx has never been a merely psychological term but also because "division of labor" played an extremely important part, as we have seen, in the _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_.

(2) The concepts of "money worship" and "egoistic need" are treated as unconscious projections of the psychological urge for "self-aggrandizement," and it is stated that in _Capital_ - as a _reversal_ of Marx's earlier position - competition is introduced as the source of the "acquisitive mania." But, we are told, this is a big mistake because "The whole system instantly collapses without the werewolf hunger for surplus value as a primary underlying postulate" (pp. 216-217).

One might ask: whose system? Marx's system or Tucker's psychiatric caricature of it? To get the answer we should read the footnote on pg. 217: "As mentioned earlier (pg. 138), Marx stated in the manuscripts of 1844, that the only wheels that set political economy in motion are greed and the war among the greedy - competition. _Now_ he suggests that the latter sets the former in motion, or that the war is the cause of the greed. He must have been uneasily aware that _the whole structure rested on the postulate of infinite greed_ as the driving force of capitalist production. To suggest that this could be derived from the competitive mechanism itself was a way of minimizing the total dependence of the system upon a highly questionable postulate, and at the same time of reinforcing the postulate." As a matter of fact at the place referred to by Tucker, Marx is talking about the inability of bourgeois political economy to go beyond external appearances and get to the causes. (See _MSS of 1844_, pg. 68. In Bottomore's even clearer version: "The only moving forces which political economy recognizes are _avarice_ and the _war between the avaricious, competition_." pg. 121.) And there are many places in the _Manuscripts of 1844_ where Marx makes it amply clear that the accumulation of capital (and thus "greed" coupled with it) is the _necessary result_ of competition, not its cause.

The alleged contradiction, therefore, simply does not exist in Marx. He is not concerned in the disputed passage with the _"competitive mechanism"_ of capitalism but with its _distorted reflection_ in the writings of bourgeois political economy. There is no trace of a psychologistic treatment of greed and competition in the _Manuscripts of 1844_ but, on the contrary, the clearest possible statement of Marx's rejection of the bourgeois notion of "egoistic man" (who is supposed to be selfish "by nature"). Thus the _whole structure_ of Tucker's argument rests on a _complete misunderstanding_ of the passage which is supposed to establish his whole case. Without _his_ postulate of _"infinite greed"_ (of which even in his own mistranslated version of Marx's words there is no trace) this whole amateurish psychiatry-centered construction collapses.

To sum up: reading the evidence presented by Tucker in support of his psychiatric hypothesis, we find that the whole construction is based on distortions, mistranslations, and sometimes even on a complete misunderstanding of the passages referred to. Moreover, this book is full of inconsistencies and self-contradictions. Thus the conclusion is inescapable: Marx's nonsocial, openly subjectivistic, psychological system is a myth which exists only in Tucker's imagination. _Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx_ is constructed around the dogmatic assertion according to which the fundamental human relationship is the individual's "_intra_-personal" relation to himself, and the relations of _men to men_ are secondary, derivative, etc. No attempt is made to prove this assertion, or even to put forward a single argument in its favor. It is simply assumed by Tucker as self-evident and as the absolute standard of all evaluation. Accordingly, alienation is a merely individual matter: "_No matter how many_ individual men may belong to this category, it is always an _individual matter_" (p. 240.) Thus the "supersession" of alienation must also be confined to the individual's imagination: "Only so long as an alienated man can _find in himself_ the courage to recognize that the 'alien power' against which he rebels is _a power within him_, that the inhuman force which makes his life a _forced labor_ is _a force of the self_, that the 'alien, hostile, powerful man' is an _inner man_, the absolute being of his _imagination_, has he hope of transcending his alienation" (pgs. 241-242). Here we can also see why this book is, despite its almost unbelievable intellectual standard, a favorite of men like Daniel Bell: for in this kind of a "radical critique of society" no mention is ever made of capitalism in a negative sense. The "radical critique of society" turns out to be a critique of the "inner man" of the isolated individual who finds in himself alone the (merely psychological) causes of his own "self-alienation," insisting that even the "forced labor" to which he is subjected under the capitalistically reified social relations of production is only "a force of the self, a feature of his own imagination."

[220] This is why we have to read with caution Heinemann's assertion that "existentialism is in all its forms a philosophy of crisis. It expresses the crisis of man openly and directly, whereas other schools, like that of the logical positivists, express it indirectly and unconsciously. For this reason, the fact of estrangement in its enormous complexity and many-sidedness became central with them." (F.H. Heinemann, _Existentialism and the Modern Predicament_, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1953, pg. 167.) That existentialism is a philosophy of crisis may be true, abstractly speaking. However, the "crisis of man" is always historically specific. In existentialism itself, it was the changing nature of this crisis that gave rise to the very different forms of the movement. It is highly inaccurate to say that the category of alienation is _central_ in existentialism as a whole. Emmanuel Mounier is much more accurate when he writes: "One cannot discuss fundamental estrangement from a Christian standpoint. This concept of estrangement, which, from the Christian standpoint so categorically denies the Incarnation of the transcendent being in human being, is, by contrast, a prominent feature of the atheist branch of existentialism." (_Existentialist Philosophies. An Introduction_. Translated by Eric Blow, Rockliff, London, 1948, pgs. 35-36.) Mounier distinguishes between "fundamental estrangement" and "accidental estrangement." This latter is present, in various degrees, in the different forms of Christian existentialism as well). The general conceptual framework of a philosophical trend is modified according to the particular socio-historical situations in which the philosophers conceive their works. There are very great differences in this respect among the various trends of existentialism. In Kierkegaard's writings "alienation" is rather peripheral, as compared to those of Sartre; and there are existentialists - like Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel, for instance - who are situated somewhere between the two extremes. Besides, even when the notion of alienation plays an important part in the philosopher's system, one should not ignore the differences in the social significance of its various interpretations. In the thirties and after the war the concept of alienation started to play a greater role in the various existentialist approaches to contemporary problems, reflecting a more dynamic socio-historical situation. Mounier himself - the principal figure of existential "personalism" - reformulated in this sense the program of his movement shortly after the war, insisting that "Le personnalisme est un effort continu pour chercher les zones ou une victoire décisive sur toutes les formes d'oppression et d'aliénation, économique, sociale ou idéologique, peut déboucher sur une véritable libération de l'homme."

Because of this simple fact that every succeeding generation finds itself in possession of the productive forces won by the previous generation, which serve it as the _raw material_ for new production, an _inter-connection_ arises in human history, there is a history of humanity which has become all the more a history of humanity since the productive forces of man and therefore his social relations have been extended. Hence it necessarily follows: the _social_ history of men is never anything but the history of their _individual development_, whether they are conscious of it or not. Their material relations are the basis of all their relations. These material relations are only the _necessary forms_ in which their _material_ and _individual_ activity is realized."

# Review: Marx before Marxism by David McLellan

**Marx Before Marxism**, by David McLellan. New York: Harper & Row, 1970. $6.50. Pp. 233.

---

Here is another addition to the vast literature devoted to the young Marx and his relationship to the mature Marx of Capital--a subject which has agitated academic Marxism during the last decade. McLellan offers as justification for his book the claim that previous interpretations of Marx's early writings suffered from one or another bias, whereas his own exposition is presented "as neutrally as possible." He presents these writings "in their historical context," which has of course been extensively dealt with by other authors as well and which does not release him from answering the question of whether there is a decisive difference between the young and the old Marx. He concludes in the end that there is no difference because Marx remained a Hegelian throughout his life, as demonstrated by his Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie.

McLellan offers us, once more, the social and cultural conditions under which Marx grew up, his family relations and his early intellectual pursuits, particularly his conversion to Hegelianism. From this conversion, and with the aid of Feuerbach, Marx soon turned into a critic of Hegelian philosophy, a process which began with the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, the contributions to the Deutsch- Französische Jahrbücher, and The German Ideology. After the last-named work Marx shifted his interests from philosophy to political economy, as dictated by his historical materialism, which had grown out of his criticism of both Feuerbach and Hegel, and out of his own observations of social reality.

This shift from philosophy to the critique of political economy has strangely been interpreted as a sacrifice of the humanism that characterized Marx's early writings in which he concerned himself with the nature of man as such, with man's self-alienation and the requirements for recovering his human essence. This concern soon made room for the consideration of historical, class-determined men, the exploitation of labor by capital, and the proletarian revolution. His philosophical humanism became practical humanism, to be realized in a classless, non-exploitative society. In this sense, there is, of course, continuity between the young and the old Marx in that the latter was able to express clearly and concretely what the young Marx had set forth vaguely and abstractly. The choice between the young and the old Marx is thus an impossible one, even though Marx's later writings are clearly preferable to his early ones.

In recent years the emphasis has nonetheless been on Marx's early writings, not on his scientific analysis of capitalist society. McLellan assumes that this is due to the fact that some of Marx's economic and political predictions had lost their validity through the "progressive integration of the working class into the social order." Still, people remained unhappy and attempts to explain their dissatisfactions led to a return to the unsolved problem of man's alienation. The gap between ideology and reality in Eastern Europe, too, showed that the humanist side of Marxism had been neglected and that a return to Marx's early concerns might be a way to improve conditions in the socialist states. What appears as essential in this explanation is a change in the attitudes of men as a precondition to a betterment of their social conditions. And the new concern with man's alienation in existing societal forms thus reflects the present inability or unwillingness to alter these forms. It is a return to an idealist position, precisely to the position of the early Marx still engaged in the process of freeing himself from Hegelianism. But the answer to this trend must be derived from the Marxism of Marx, not from the Marx before Marxism.

This leads to the question of the relation between Marx and Hegel and here, according to McLellan, "Marx always remained in some sense a Hegelian." The question is only in what sense? McLellan points to Lenin's remark that "It is impossible to fully grasp Marx's Capital, and especially the first chapter, if you have not studied or understood the whole of Hegel's Logic"; he also cites Hegelian terminology employed by Marx in the Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie. In a recent article in the magazine Encounter, McLellan describes the Grundrisse as the newly discovered "missing link" which restored continuity and inner harmony between the writings of the early and the late Marx. In this connection, he finds it particularly "noteworthy that ... throughout the Grundrisse, the agent of transformation--the revolutionary activity of the proletariat--is never alluded to."

The Grundrisse are exactly what their name implies, a first attempt (_Rohentwurf_) in preparation for the contemplated Capital. They were not considered ready for publication, but were the product of fifteen years of study and self-clarification and, therefore, did not need to contain the obvious, such as alluding to the proletariat as the agent of social change which had already been established ten years earlier in the Communist Manifesto. For McLellan, however, the Grundrisse is Marx's "basic work"--of which the Critique of Political Economy and Capital are "only partial elaborations'"--because in the Grundrisse "the Hegelian categories in which Marx forms his thought are obvious," and because "questions that were prominent in Marx's 1844 writings--such as the nature of labor and the resolution of the conflict between the individual and the community--are taken up again and filled out with a wealth of detail." Marxism does not, however, concern itself so much with the true nature of labor and relations between the individual and the community, as, quite: specifically, with the nature of wage-labor and the relations between labor and capital.

Although Hegel's philosophy formed Marx's starting point, he soon realized that the idealistic dialectic was a mystification of the actual dialectical process of social development. It was not Hegel's philosophy which led Marx to an understanding of capitalist society but the relatively independent understanding of the latter which made him recognize the "rational kernel" contained in the mystical shell of Hegelian philosophy. In this limited sense, he remained a Hegelian, that is, he understood that Hegel expressed in an ideological-philosophical form an actually-occurring process, which found its concrete expression in the political economy of capitalism. Marx's dialectic is thus to be found in Capital, not in the philosophical writings, even though he could use Hegelian categories interchangeably with those of political economy, as was the case in the Grundrisse.

McLellan himself points out that Hegel's philosophy emerged out of the ideas of the French Revolution, the writings of the English economists, the growth of industry, and the economic war of all against all. Yet it turned an actual historical development into an absolute philosophical system, in which the former lost its practical meaning and therefore its revolutionary nature. If it is true, as McLellan says, that Marx's "early writings contain all the subsequent themes of Marx's thought and show them in the making," it is also true that the progress made by Marx from his early philosophical writings, via the Grundrisse to Capital, commits present-day Marxism, as it committed Marx, to stress not his philosophical starting-point but the underlying capitalist production relations in their capitalist appearance as economic categories.

Marx Myths and Legends. Harry Cleaver

### Karl Marx: Economist or Revolutionary?

During the last ten years Marxism has come to occupy a substantial position within American academia.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n1) This is especially true in economics where, until recently, discussion of Marx and the Marxist tradition was largely confined to courses in the history of economic thought and in the economic history of the Soviet Union.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n2)

The rise of an academic Marxism has been due, I would argue, to two forces. First, the struggles of students within the context of the social upheavals of the late 1960s and early 1970s carved out time and space within which politically active students could study Marxism as apart of radical economics, insurgent sociology, and so on.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n3) Second, university administrators and the business interests they generally represent have been surprisingly tolerant of the expansion of Marxist studies.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n4) This reaction to student demands is not simply a case of the “repressive tolerance” Marcuse described so vividly.[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n5) The current tolerance is due, more importantly, to the need of business for new ideas during the present period of economic and social crisis.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n6) There is a long history of the capitalist appropriation of Marxist ideas which should lend credence to this suggestion.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n7) Moreover, the numerous attempts in recent years in the business press and in professional economic journals to give space to radical ideas and to evaluate current Marxist economic research demonstrates the on-going interest of business and its ideologues in the possibility of appropriating something new from Marx. Nowhere has this tolerance been more obvious than in the area of Marxist research on the theory of economic crisis."[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n8)

This willingness on the part of business to appropriate Marxist ideas and to use them for its own purposes has been largely ignored by Marxists working on the theory of crisis. They have, time and again, formulated their theories in ways that facilitate such appropriation.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n9) Yet this is not necessary. There is a way to read Marx and to develop Marxist theory that does not lend itself to this kind of appropriation.

In this essay I do two things. First, through a series of examples, I illustrate how, in the history of Marxist work on the theory of crisis, many have forgotten the revolutionary content of Marx’s own work and thus left themselves open to the dangers of capitalist appropriation. Second, I suggest an alternative approach to the study and elaboration of Marx’s analysis of crisis that makes its political and revolutionary content explicit and thus more immune to appropriation.

### Some Problems with Marxist Crisis Theory

Recognizing the obvious interest of mainstream economists and of the business press in Marxian economics, and understanding the possibilities of the capitalist appropriation of our ideas, we should recognize real shortcomings to some of the theoretical work within Marxist economics. In the process of building an alternative economic paradigm acceptable within the academic community, too many Marxist students and Marxist economists have overemphasized “economics” and lost Marx in the process (1974).

The theory of crisis has always been a central issue in Marxist theory and indeed in Marx’s own work. He was interested in both cyclical crisis, what is often called the business cycle, and fundamental secular trends undermining the long-term viability of the system. It is certainly because we are in the midst of a major crisis of the system that this aspect of Marxist research has been the one most closely followed by the business press. It is because some Marxists have formulated crisis theory in ways comparable with bourgeois theories that business can hope to gain insight and use-value from their work.

In Marx’s own research, theory and empirical studies developed together. Probably the most important single leap forward in his thinking on this subject occurred during the crisis of 1857 when, during long nights of work, he sought integrate his empirical observations through the development of a new theoretical framework. The products of that period include both his newspaper articles and the notebooks known collectively as the _Grundrisse_. In those articles and notebooks are found a rich variety of historical and theoretical observations on various aspects of capitalist crisis. Some of those observations Marx later integrated into _Capital_ and _Theories of Surplus Value_. It is in this wealth of material that we find Marx struggling to elaborate a political analysis of crisis from which he could draw strategic lessons for the working class movement.

In the history of Marxism since Marx, however, including the present, the development of crisis theory has been disappointing. We can identify at least two striking shortcomings in this work. The first has been the tendency to focus on some narrow selection from Marx’s work. This tendency, which Peter Bell (1977) has shown to produce one-sided, monocausal theories, involved a failure to digest the full range of Marx’s work on crisis and has led to endless Marxological debates. For example, the debate between those Marxists who base themselves on Marx’s comments on underconsumption and those who base themselves on his discussion of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall has been going around in circles for over forty years and is nowhere near resolution.

The second shortcoming of Marxist work on crisis, and the one I would like to explore here, concerns the tendency to think about crisis as a subject of “economics” and to apply methods of analysis that closely parallel those of mainstream economics. This tendency not only leads Marxists to forget the political content of their categories and theories but also makes it easy for capitalist ideologues to examine and appropriate the theory for their own purposes. To illustrate this tendency I will examine a few examples from the history of Marxist crisis theory.

### Case Study 1: Rosa Luxemburg’s  
_The Accumulation of Capital_ (1968)

Luxemburg was one of the most brilliant Marxists of the early twentieth century. Her revolutionary understanding of Marx made her the arch-foe of the social democrats of the Second International, and her closeness to the working class made her a severe critic of Lenin’s elitism. Yet, when she turned to the project of developing a theory of accumulation and crisis she did what so many Marxists tend to do --she left her political acumen behind and got lost in an economic reading of _Capital_.

As is well known, Luxemburg based her theory of crisis on Marx’s analysis of reproduction in the second volume of _Capital_. She focused on Marx’s schemes of expanded reproduction and, by studying their evolution through time, came to the conclusion that given realistic assumptions it was impossible for the necessary equilibrium between the two departments to be maintained because the production of commodities would outstrip the ability of the market to absorb them. Thus, she deduced both the necessity for crisis and for some “outside” sector (e.g., imperial colonies) into which the excess products could be dumped.

Her analysis constituted one moment of along debate among Marxists on the tendencies to crisis in capitalism that took as its basic analytical framework Marx’s reproduction schemes. That debate had started with Tugan-Baranowsky’s attack on underconsumptionism and his substitution of a theory of limited disproportionality between departments.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n10) Luxemburg’ s work was partially an attack on Tugan-Baranowsky and partly an attempt to find a basis for both a theory of crisis and a theory of imperialism.

Luxemburg’s book was followed by arguments by Nikolai Bukharin, Otto Bauer, Henryk Grossman, and others.[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n11) All of these authors approached the reproduction schemes in the same manner as Luxemburg: as a basis for their reasoning about crisis, and as economists studying conditions of equilibrium. In modern terms they were reading Marx’s reproduction schemes as a two- or sometimes a three-sector growth model.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n12) Luxemburg, like the others, was studying stability conditions. Many years later, after Leontief’s adaptation of those schemes had been incorporated into macroeconomic modeling, we would find capitalist planners doing something similar with multisectoral growth models. But where Luxemburg and these other Marxists were content with the observation that the model would (or would not) automatically generate contradictions and therefore that crisis was (or was not) inevitable under capitalism, the planners would use the model to help them figure out what adjustments could be made so that accumulation could proceed smoothly.

At first glance one might say it was a stroke of genius to figure out this way of using Marx’s schemes for the analysis of crisis. Were not these Marxists extending Marx?

Marx had developed the reproduction schemes during his work on the _Grundrisse_. He did so within the context of examining some of the factors that could lead to the breakdown of accumulation. He was led to them through his examination of capital’s problems of reproducing its social totality. As Mario Tronti has shown in his book _Operai e Capitale_ (1966), the reproduction schemes constitute one approach to the examination of “social” capital, where social capital includes not merely the sum of the individual capitals but also the production and reproduction of the working class and therefore the struggles of that reproduction.[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n13) This view of the schemes sees them not as schemata of purely interindustrial flows but as one approach to a political totality.

This is absent in an economic reading of part 3 of volume 2. Luxemburg and the others deal with “reproduction” the way contemporary growth theorists do --in a very narrow and fetishistic “economic” way that leaves social and political relations out of account and reduces Marx’ s problem to one of abstract quantitative proportionality.

The result? I submit that this part of her analysis of crisis provides little of use to the working class other than a formal argument about the inevitability of imperialism.

### Case Study 2: Paul Sweezy’s _Theory of Capitalist Development_ (1942) and _Monopoly Capital_ (1946)

For almost thirty years, from the 1940s to the early 1960s, Paul Sweezy was, with Paul Baran, the best known Marxist in the United States. His books and his magazine _Monthly Review_ educated the generation of Marxist economists who grew up in the 1960s and are today teaching in universities, schools, and shop-floors across the United States.

Unlike Rosa Luxemburg, who was first and foremost a political activist and dug into Marx in the course of her political practice, Sweezy was first of all a scholar and an economist. Educated at Harvard under Alvin Hansen, one of the foremost interpreters of Keynes, Sweezy developed a theory of crisis that bears the clear marks of his profession and his background. If Marxist crisis theory today is above all a theory of economic crisis, it is partly due to Sweezy’s pervasive influence.

I want to discuss here only three parts of Sweezy’s treatment of crisis theory in his books. The first is the treatment in his _Theory_ of Luxemburg and of the other Marxists who based their work on Marx’s schemes of reproduction. The second is his treatment and dismissal of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. The third is his embrace of Marx’s comments on the limits to working-class consumption as the valid core of crisis theory.

In his _Theory_, when Sweezy turns to Luxemburg and the others I have mentioned, he evaluates their theory and criticizes it in its own terms. He presents the mathematics of the reproduction schemes and in good economic form sets out mathematically precise equilibrium conditions. In the case of Otto Bauer’s work, Sweezy explicitly translates it into the form of a mathematical growth model. His evaluation of their work only involves questioning either their assumptions or details of their reasoning, never the general framework of a purely economic approach. As with most economists, accumulation for Sweezy is the accumulation of capital narrowly defined in terms of growing amounts of money, means of production, mobilized labor, and commodities. It is for this reason he can work with the language and forms acceptable to Leontief or Harrod-Domar.

When Sweezy turns to Marx’s “law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall,” he interprets it in a very typical economic fashion. By this I mean he assumes that the theory concerns forces acting on the actual monetary rate of profit. Secondly, when he uses the “value” categories of variable capital (v), constant capital (c), surplus value (s), the rate of exploitation (s/v), and the organic composition of capital (c/v), he treats them exactly the way an economist would treat any variables: as mathematical quantities to be manipulated formalistically. Thus he notes that if the numerator and denominator of the rate of profit s/(c+v) are both divided by v, we obtain (s/v)/[c/v)+ 1]. This he likes because the rate of profit is now expressed in terms of the two categories that Marx is concerned with: the rate of exploitation and the organic composition of capital. On the basis of this expression he argues that the “law,” is indeterminant because although c/v might rise faster than s/v, as c is substituted for v, we cannot be sure a priori because the rising productivity that accompanies the investment in constant capital lowers the value of c as well as that of v, and there is no way to predict which will fall most. Voila! So much for the “law” Marx called the most fundamental and important law of capitalist development.

As a result of Sweezy’s argument there has been an almost endless flow of articles attacking or defending him on this subject. Among those Marxists most prominent in the attack have been Paul Mattick (1969b), Mario Cogoy (1973), and David Yaffe (1972), who have all defended the centrality and validity of the law. Most of these critiques have included an attempt to restate the law in a different mathematical form in order to recuperate it. Defenses of Sweezy’s rejection have also been forthcoming from the man himself --repeatedly in the postwar period-- and from others on either theoretical (Roemer, 1978; 1979; 1981) or empirical (Weiskopf, 1979) grounds.

And what are the essential points of the debate among all these Marxists? Are they political points? Hardly, they are not even political economic points. They are mainly mathematical and formalistic. In his summary of the debate Herb Gintis, writing in OIlman and Vernoff’s (1982) book, says “in general American Marxists have carefully scrutinized the mathematical theory on which the falling-rate-of-profit prediction is based, and have concluded that there is no such tendency.”

What are we to say about this kind of Marxism? Certainly the similarity of the debate to the mainstream discussion on the same subject is striking.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n14) If this is Marxian economics, then clearly the emphasis is on economics, not Marx. What we have here is a sanitized, seminar-room Marxism that has been stripped of its political content and class anger. This is a Marxism mainstream economists can understand and evaluate in their own terms. If more economists of this Marxian I. stripe are not getting tenure it can only be because either the mainstream judges f their work to be unproductive or because, like Rosa Luxemburg, their political actions in other areas are more militant than their theory.

The last aspect of Sweezy’s work that I want to examine, and one which has also generated a whole wing of contemporary Marxist crisis theory, is his interpretation of Marx’s comments on the limits to working-class consumption. Sweezy’s positive view of Marx’s comments fit easily with a Hansenian interpretation of Keynes on inadequate aggregate demand and the views of both Hansen (1938; 1941) and Steindl (1952) on capitalism’s tendencies toward stagnation.

This interpretation of Marx as an underconsumptionist is again very much within the tradition of economics. From Malthus, whom Marx studied, through Hobson in the underground, to Keynes at the center of mainstream thought, the issue of the adequacy of demand to sustain and induce growth in output has been a central subject of debate. But, where Marx studied capitalist attempts to limit working-class income and working-class demands for ever higher income (as well as less work) as one important class contradiction in the system, Sweezy finds a justification for embracing a pessimistic Keynesianism in which it is the weakness of the working class that leads to crisis. So preoccupied is Sweezy with studying the similarities and differences between Marx and Keynes that he included as an appendix to his book an essay by Tsuru that explicitly maps Marxian and Keynesian aggregate macro categories onto each other.

Twenty years later, when Sweezy published _Monopoly Capital_, the book he had written with Paul Baran, he still embraced essentially the same position. But by this time Marxism provided little more than a rhetorical gloss on what might otherwise have been taken as the work of a liberal mainstream economist in the tradition of the neoclassical synthesis. In _Monopoly Capital_ the analytical core of Sweezy and Baran’s reasoning was a mixture of neoclassical firm theory and Keynesian macro theory. The title pointed to their central concern with defining the current stage of capitalism in terms of the structure of capitalist markets --monopoly as opposed to an earlier competitive state. Their discussion of the “absorption of the surplus” amounted to a twist on the Keynesian problem of adequate aggregate demand. Gone almost completely from their analysis were Marx’s theoretical categories based on the labor theory of value. In the place of surplus value, we found surplus; in the place of the problem of extracting surplus value, we found the problem of disposing of it. Whereas _The Theory of Capitalist Development_ had at least the form of Marxian theory, _Monopoly Capital_ adopted both the form and content (albeit with the authors’ own critical approach) of mainstream economics. Only in the concluding chapters when they set aside economics and draw on Critical Theory’s concepts of historical reason and capitalist irrationality did they retain much of the Marxian tradition --and the aspects they did retain derive more from Hegel than from Marx.

When other Marxists began to attack Sweezy, his abandonment of Marx and his embrace of a Keynesian crisis theory of inadequate demand was one of their first points of departure. (See Mattick, 1969b; Cogoy, 1973; Yaffe, 1972.) In his responses to these attacks Sweezy (1974) back-pedalled and recast his underconsumptionism once more in Marxian theoretical terms. But it is not the details of that debate that interest me here. It is rather the way in which Sweezy’s views, and a whole subsequent literature, formulated Marx’s thoughts in the language and framework of economics. How can we be surprised when, in the late 1960s, many radical economists considered their real problem to be the discovery of how to adapt mainstream economics to the analysis of the subjects that concerned them? Many considered the legacy of Marx (whom most had not yet studied) to lie more in the identification of problems that were ignored by the mainstream than as a source of different theoretical tools. And when they did return to Marx, after having been raised on Baran and Sweezy and having followed Marxist debates on crisis that resembled in form, and even to some degree content, the debates of mainstream economics, should we be too shocked that they read Marx as an economist? I think not. Nor do I think we should be shocked that much of the contemporary Marxist crisis theory continues in the same vein.

### Case Study 3: The “Relative Shares” Literature

The “relative shares” literature includes most prominently the work of Glyn and Sutcliffe (1972) and followers in England, and that of Boddy and Crotty (1975) and followers in the United States (Crotty and Rapping, 1975). Briefly put, this is a brand of Marxist crisis theory that draws explicitly or implicitly on Marx’s work on the role of the wage in crisis. This work includes the discussion in volume 1, chapter 25, of _Capital_, and Marx’s analysis in _Wages, Prices and Profit_. At its core is the idea that workers, through their struggles, can and have pushed up income to the point where it undermines capitalist profits or the capitalist share of national output. Sometimes this argument is formulated in terms of wages, sometimes more broadly in terms of all income (wages plus benefits, plus government services, etc.). In most cases the theory is backed up by empirical studies that show that this has in fact occurred during the current crisis.

Unlike the theories mentioned earlier, this one has an explicit political moment of class struggle. Underconsumptionism has an implicit moment of class struggle --the capitalist attempt to hold down wages-- although it is rather one-sided in its usual interpretation. But in the relative shares literature, for almost the first time in the history of academic Marxism, the class struggle has been recognized and has found a place among economic models and mathematical formalisms. This clearly constitutes a refreshing departure from the kinds of economic crisis theories we have discussed so far.

And yet, there are two problems that persist within this literature. The first is the tendency to confine the analysis of crisis to the sphere of circulation without recognizing how the demand for higher wages and income has complemented a simultaneous attack on the structuring of life around work. In short, the relative shares theorists have mostly failed to analyze the revolt against work and the crisis in production. Where the revolt against work has been recognized it has been interpreted as a rebellion against the degrading conditions of work within capitalism, but there has been no grasp of the way people’s growing refusal to be reduced to mere workers has constituted a fundamental undermining of the capitalist order.

Second, by confining the analysis of crisis to the struggle over the division of output, the relative shares theorists formulate the problematic of crisis in a way very similar to mainstream economic discussions of income distribution. This is a very old reformist terrain of discourse in which one debates the division of output but eschews discussion of overthrowing the wage system itself. Within this discourse conservative, pro-capitalist economists and commentators (such as those associated with the Reagan administration) respond to the decline in capitalist shares by calling for a redressing of shares --an attack on wages and social services. Liberal, pro-capitalist economists (such as neoliberals like Thurow) call for an incomes policy to stabilize shares in a proportion favorable to capital, yet not totally destructive of working-class standards of living. The radical critics are willing to grant the necessity of a social surplus for investment and growth but want a larger role for workers in determining the course of such investment. They want greater “economic democracy"--a slogan and a policy which has become the clarion cry of today’s social democrats.

Thus, this relative shares version of Marxian crisis theory also falls within the scope of mainstream debates, albeit at the socialist fringe.

Is this the best Marxism has to offer? Are these theories of crisis, formulated in the language and style of economics, all that can be gotten from Marx? Is Marxism, after all, just a subdivision of economics? Fortunately, the answer is no, this is not all there is --not even in the area of crisis theory, let alone other aspects of Marxism. There is an alternative way of reading Marx and Marx’s theories of crisis that leads to quite different results.

### Marx the Revolutionary

The alternative to the economic interpretation of Marx that I find the most useful is the reading of his concepts and theories as moments of his political analysis of capitalism as class struggle. This is what I call a political reading of Marx. The roots and development of this kind of political reading I have sketched in the introduction to my book _Reading_ Capital _Politically_ (1979). Among the best-known writers associated with this approach are C. L. R. James, Raya Duneyevskaya, Martin Glaberman, Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude Lafort (in the 1950s), Ranerio Panzieri, Mario Tronti (in the 1960s), Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Selma James, and Antonio Negri.[[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n15) This approach explicitly rejects any “economic” or “political economic” analysis that sees Marx’s work as focused on the economy, where economy is conceived in the usual sense of the spheres of production, circulation, and distribution. This approach insists that what is usually called the economic sphere is made up of moments of a political whole: the class struggle.

Basic to this approach is the position that the object of Marx’s study, and the only proper object for any revolutionary, is the class struggle. Let us be clear, this position denies the autonomy of the political --there is no economic sphere here and political sphere over there. The position argues that from the point of view of workers who want to overthrow capitalism there can be one and only one subject of study: the structures of their power relations with capital. Everything must be interpreted in terms of its relation to this central political issue.

It is not that the class struggle is being elevated to a new centrality in theory, or, in the case of, “crisis theory,” , that class struggle is seen to be the “cause” of crisis. Class struggle is neither a cause nor an effect. It is the whole, and Marx’s analysis is seen to be concerned with the exploration of the forces at work within that whole.

Therefore Marx’s theory of crisis, like the theory of accumulation more generally, is a theory of the dynamics of the class struggle. When Marx says in _Capital_ that accumulation is first and foremost the accumulation of the classes, we must recognize that this necessarily means the accumulation of the class relations of conflict and struggle. Accumulation certainly includes the expanded reproduction of money capital, commodity capital, productive capital, and so on, but these are understood to be, not things, but moments of the basic class relationship .

This political reading of Marx is an interpretation that takes seriously his repeated admonition that capital is above all a social relation. It also takes seriously the Ilth Thesis on Feuerbach: that the point is to transform the world, and therefore any theory worth the title Marxist must not only embody the class relations but also playa self-conscious and explicit role in the struggle for transformation.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n16)

Part of what differentiates this approach from most other versions of Marxism is its way of looking at capital. For most Marxists, orthodox or revisionist, “capital” is the totality of the capitalists and their capital. Its dynamic is derived from what they like to call its “internal logic.” The driving force of this “capitalogic,” according to them, is competition among capitalists. Within this framework, workers appear as outside factors capable of resisting the logic of capital, and even, in principle, of overthrowing it, but their struggles are reactive and only have the effect of throwing up barriers to capital’s self-propelled development.

By reviewing the examples of crisis theory I have examined, one can see that the above characterization applies universally. Luxemburg, Sweezy, their supporters and detractors, and even the relative shares theorists see capitalism developing through its own “internal laws of motion.” Whether we look at the dynamics of underconsumption, the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, or the profit squeeze, we see working-class struggle as external to capital’s own logic. Underconsumption assumes at its core a limit to workers’ ability to raise wages. In the case of the falling rate of profit, the drive to raise the organic composition of capital is usually taken to flow from competition. And in the case of the relative shares argument, the working-class struggle that undercuts accumulation appears as an exogenous threat to capitalist development.

Within the alternative framework that I present here, to speak of crisis is to speak of a crisis of the class relation. In general, a capitalist crisis is therefore a crisis of capitalist control over the working class. Therefore, the so-called internal laws of motion of capital must be understood to be the general characteristics of the class struggle. Similarly, the categories of Marx’s labor theory of value are concepts designed to lay bare the patterns and logic of that struggle.

Within this framework, Marx is seen to be, above all, a militant theoretician of the subject, or more precisely, of two political and historical class subjects: the capitalist and working class. The “laws of motion” Marx describes are the regularities capital is able to impose in the face of the struggles of an antagonistic opponent. The two historical subjects are fundamentally different in character, and that difference forms the core of their antagonism.

Capital is a particular way of organizing the lives of human beings. Within capitalist society most people are members of the working class. They are under an endless and artificial compulsion to work, producing a surplus which capitalists either consume or, more importantly, reinvest to create ever more work. The capitalists, whether of the coupon-clipping leisure class or the modern corporate managerial hierarchy, are essentially what Marx called “functionaries” of capital as a way of organizing society. That is to say, their work, to the degree that they work, is the work of organizing the process of the accumulation of capital, whether in the sphere of production, circulation, or reproduction. Capital is self-reproducing, as orthodox Marxists often say, but only in the sense that it recreates the social conditions within which most people are forced to sell their labor power in order to survive. This is why the work ethic is central to capitalist ideology- because it justifies the life sentences of hard labor that capital would like to impose on all of us.

But the working class, those upon whom work is imposed, repeatedly breaks free of capitalist ideological and social controls and struggles against that imposition. As an historical subject workers form a true class for itself, in Marx’s terms, only when they engage in such battles.

Yet, there is something else even more fundamental that differentiates the working-class subject and explains the antagonism that permeates every moment of capital and every category in Marx. It is the fundamental quality of creativity and change that workers have as human beings and that they struggle to liberate. This is what might be called the positive side of workers’ struggle. Not only do they oppose the subordination of their lives to capitalist-imposed work, but they fight for their own autonomous development, or self-valorization, as Toni Negri (1984) calls it. And because that development is autonomous and refuses all outside coercion, it tends to escape capital’s efforts to bind it within its own forms. It is in this sense that capital, as one particular way of life, is frozen or dead, as Marx said. It only knows its own circuits. It only knows how to repeat the same forms and impose the same content, over and over again. Vampire-like, it can only draw its energy and life from others. It seeks to harness the spontaneous energy and creativity of human beings by limiting their autonomy and by turning them into workers in its factories and offices and into functionaries of its own existence.

Critical Theorists grasped this truth. Their failure lay in not seeing how Marx’s work contained elements of something they were unable to either conceive or construct on their own: a theory of working-class autonomy against capital and for its own self-development.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n17)

Most Marxists working on the theory of crisis see neither the autonomy of the working class nor the capitalist need to harness it. They read Marx’s categories as they read the variables of mainstream economics, and they play the same games with them. But we do not have to do this. We can, instead, take those categories, slowly, one by one, and then in combination, and discover how they constitute categories of the class relations of struggle. We can give them a “political reading” to discover their meaning for each class. And by doing this we can recuperate Marx’s work on crisis, and maybe even some of the work done by our Marxist economists.

This is a project that is already underway. Its historical and political origins I have sketched in the introduction to my book _Reading_ Capital _Politically_. There I undertook a reinterpretation of the basic categories of Marx’s labor theory of value to show how they could be read as categories of the class struggle over the organization of society around work. A more recent effort contains a first, systematic interpretation of Marx’s writings on crisis as observations and theories of how working-class struggles rupture the processes of accumulation (Cleaver and Bell, 1982). Other recent materials and references to work on crisis carried out within this framework can be found in the journals Zerowork and Midnight Notes as well as in Red Notes (1980), Semiotext(e) (1980), and Negri (1984).[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n18)

For the purposes of this essay I will restrict myself to the discussion of two aspects of this approach to Marxian crisis theory. The first concerns its ability to offer an alternative interpretation of those concepts of Marx which have been given an economic interpretation and used as the basis of theories of economic crisis. The second concerns the reduced susceptibility of this kind of interpretation of Marx to the kind of capitalist instrumentalization warned against above.

### The Schemes of Reproduction and Class Struggle

As mentioned previously, Tronti has provided the basis for an alternative reading of Marx’s reproduction schemes. His rethinking of the material in volume 2 of _Capital_ led him to see that the schemes provided one approach to the analysis of the total “social capital” where social capital must be understood to involve not only the sphere of production but also that of reproduction. Tronti recognized that Department II of the schemes, which produces the means of subsistence, is providing not only for the reproduction of the workers in the industries of departments I and II but also for all others, including those in the reserve army whether active or latent. The concept of “department” therefore must be conceived more broadly than a mere aggregation of factories. Department II refers to the sphere of working-class self-reproduction which includes the industries producing the means of subsistence but is not limited to them.

In this vein, we can see that the very division of the economy into two departments producing means of production and means of subsistence corresponds to the class division in capitalist society. The means of production, after , all, constitute that part of production that is of most direct interest to capitalists. When they fight to maximize surplus value and investment they are, in effect, fighting to shift the distribution of workers’ labor away from the products that directly interest workers (the means of subsistence) and toward the production of means of production. Conversely, Department II, which includes the production of means of subsistence, is of most direct concern to workers, and their struggles to raise wages and benefits at least partly tend to maximize the role of this department. Furthermore, the attempt by workers to reduce the amount of work they must give up to acquire the means of subsistence amounts to an attempt to subordinate the role of production in reproduction to the expansion of the time available for reproduction and self-valorization.

From a working-class political point of view, these must be counted among the most essential characteristics of this part of Marx’s analysis. This class perspective on the basic categories of the schemes of reproduction gives us away of looking at them in which they appear as determinations of the class relations of struggle.

From a capitalist point of view, the relations between the departments are ones that must be managed, either by the price mechanism or by direct planning or by some combination of the two. The capitalists must expand output in Department I if they are to expand their investment in fixed capital and expand the imposition of work to new generations of workers-especially since part of that investment is labor displacing. At the same time, they must try to manage workers’ demands for wages and the means of subsistence so that the working class can reproduce itself, but also limit Department II production so that it does not cut into Department I’s share of inputs and share of output.

Once we see that the distribution of resources across departments is something capital must fight for and try to manage in order to guarantee its own expanded reproduction, then the interest of capitalist economists in elaborating the schemes into input-output tables and multisectoral growth models is obvious. Whether the schemes be studied as a two-sector growth model or be elaborated into Leontief’s giant one-hundred-plus-sector models of contemporary economies, the object is clear enough.

But why should Marxists do this? Marx certainly did not do it. Was it just because he didn’t have time? Or was it because there is no need?

We have seen what the capitalists gain: it helps them clarify the dimension of a problem they face. They want to see what is required to achieve accumulation. Since we are not seeking to spur accumulation but to rupture it, there is no reason to think that we need the same kind of information.

Sometimes, it does help to understand what capital is trying to do in order to be able to anticipate and undermine it. But it is not clear that growth models provide that kind of information. And to the degree that they do, we can get the information from the models that are being used to plan. That is certainly one reason why we need to study mainstream economics --to spy on capitalist planning.

But what, if any thing, do we gain from the elaboration of Marx’s reproduction schemes? If the work of Marxist economists to date is any indication, we don’t gain much. Their debates on the inevitability of crisis have gone round in circles, with the conclusions derived depending on the assumptions made at the outset --as in any model. So far, after some eighty years of debate, it seems to me very little has been accomplished. For the future the burden is on those who would seek to use Marxian reproduction schemes beyond the use to which Marx put them --one way of clarifying some aspects of the class relation.

### The Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall and Class Struggle

If the debate over crisis that has turned around the reproduction schemes must be judged rather fruitless, then so too has been the debate over the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Within this second debate many valid criticisms have been leveled against one or another argument. But, from the perspective of an interpretation of Marx that insists that his theories be read politically, the most basic criticism of the whole debate is that all of its participants think that the subject under discussion is the monetary rate of profit. Whether the position taken leads to the demand for empirical verification of the theory by examining the actual evolution of some average rate of profit, or whether it leads to an insistence on the theory’s status as a statement of tendency that cannot be falsified because the actual rate of profit may be under the influence of other forces, there is never any doubt that it is the monetary rate of profit whose behavior is under study.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n19) It is partly for this reason that the so-called transformation problem has been so important to these Marxists. Since they want to analyze the tendency of the rate of profit to fall at the level of money profits, they must be preoccupied with whether or not the monetary form of aggregate surplus value accurately expresses the behavior of the value category.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n20)

This is the universal position, despite the fact that Marx carries on his whole analysis in value terms. His expression for the rate of profit is the ratio of surplus value extracted to value invested, that is, the ratio of surplus labor time extracted to the sum of the labor time embodied in the means of production and the labor time that is embodied in the final product but returned to the workers for their subsistence. In short, what s/(c+v) represents is one measure of the degree of ease or difficulty of extracting surplus labor.

Marx (1981, chap. 9), however, is at pains to point out that his analysis is at the level of the entire social capital. As we have seen with reference to the reproduction schemes, social capital is more than the sum of the individual capitals. Therefore, his analysis of the rate of profit is at the level of class relations, not at the level of the firm or even of the industrial sector of the economy.

This becomes even clearer when we focus on the two determinants of the rate of profit that he uses to analyze its evolutionary tendencies: the rate of exploitation (s/v) and the organic composition of capital (c/v). We have seen how Sweezy (and many others) have treated these categories pretty much the same way mainstream economists treat the rate of return on investment and the capital-labor ratio: as quantitative mathematical variables that can be manipulated formalistically. We have also seen how many Marxists view their determination: as by-products of competition. Leaving aside the question of the direction of change of the organic composition of capital, we know that the substitution of capital for labor within technological change is generally thought to be the result of competition among firms who seek to undercut each other’s prices by lowering costs. Similarly, the rise of c/v is seen by most economists working in this area as a by-product of just this same relative surplus value strategy component of competition. The evolution of s/v and of c/v thus appear as by-products of what Negri (1984) has aptly called the “sordid family quarrels of capital.” This is why the debate over the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as a result of the tendency of the organic composition to rise has been confined, on the whole, to the realm of “capitalogic” and has been devoid of any political class content.

Once again, this is by no means necessary. A political reading of volume 1 of _Capital_ reveals that both the rate of exploitation and the organic composition of capital are imminently political categories. Right from the start in Marx’s discussion of absolute surplus value, the determination of length of the working day, and hence of s/v, is the result of class struggle which Marx sketches in chapter 10.

Next, in his discussion of relative surplus value Marx states quite plainly that it becomes capital’s central strategy because of the success of the working class in forcing down the length of the working day (1977: chap. 15). Thereafter, with respect to the continued rapid development of machinery and modern industry, he argues that “It would be possible to write a whole history of the inventions made since 1830 for the sole purpose of providing capital with weapons against working class revolt” (1977: 563). And why does capital need such technological weapons that are embodied in arising c/v? Obviously because of the constant spur of such revolt. More generally we can show, as Raniero Panzieri (1976) has done at length, that the tendency of the organic composition of capital to rise occurs as one part of capital’s ever renewed efforts to plan its control over labor power. We can also learn to read this concept of Marx’s from a worker’s viewpoint and see that not only is the organic composition of capital based on the technical composition, that is, the particular combination of labor power and means of production in use, but it also implies a certain structure of power relations between the working class and capital.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n21) It is the working-class recomposition of those power relations that forces capital to substitute constant for all-too-variable capital.

From this perspective we can see how to reinterpret Marxist economists’ central concept of competition. We can agree that competition is a phenomenon “internal” to capital, but capital conceived as the class relation. We can recognize it as one mechanism through which capital rewards its best managers --those who can get the most work and creativity from their workers-- and gets rid of those who are least capable of controlling the working class.

Having now seen how the basic determinants of the rate of profit, and the changes in them, are themselves moments of the class struggle, we can see that the law of the tendency is itself a characteristic of the evolution of the class war. But what does the law tell us if not that the class struggle tends to result in a fall in the monetary rate of profit?

Let us look at the rate of profit once again. I have already said that it is a ratio of the surplus labor extracted to the labor invested. It is therefore one measure of the difficulty of imposing surplus labor. If, therefore, there is a tendency for this rate to fall, then there is a tendency for it to become more and more difficult for capital to impose surplus labor. And if it is increasingly difficult to impose surplus labor, then it becomes equally difficult to impose labor at all.

Here at last is an explanation of why Marx considered the law of the tendency to be the most important law of capitalist development, an explanation that links it to the most fundamental defining character of capitalism. It reveals that working class struggle and the capitalist response of substituting machinery for workers tends to undermine the foundation of the capitalist order: its universal imposition of work.[[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n22)

We can conclude this recasting of the falling rate of profit theory by pointing out some implications of our reasoning. First, if workers’ struggles for more income and less work drive capital to expand the use of labor-displacing machinery, then evidence that the workings of this law are undermining capitalist accumulation is not to be found in time series of monetary profit rates, a la Feldstein and Nordhaus, but rather in secular declines in the proportion of the labor force employed in the profitable production of goods and services. While a decline in the secular growth of productivity might indicate a crisis in the relative surplus value strategy of raising c/v, it is only at the level of capital’s ability to impose work that the law of the tendency applies.

Second, what Marx’s reasoning shows is the absolute centrality of workers’ struggle against work in the effort to undermine and overthrow capital. This can be arrived at directly by observing the way capital builds its civilization on the imposition of work, but Marx’s law tells us something more. It shows how “progressive,” that is, productivity-raising, capitalist responses to workers’ demands ultimately reinforce the direction of workers’ struggles. His analysis also implies that not only should we refuse both the Luddite attack on productivity-increasing new technology and the recourse to “appropriate” (labor-intensive) technology, but we must focus rather on how to appropriate the time set free. Marx not only understood this, he saw beyond the crisis of capitalist control to the possibility of a postcapitalist world in which not labor but “disposable time” becomes the measure of value (1973: 708).

### Underconsumptionism and Class Struggle

There can be no doubt that Marx saw the limits to working-class income as constituting a limit to the ability of Department II to expand, and thus indirectly a limit to the expansion of Department I as well. But the effort to elevate this contradiction to the status of the core of crisis theory comes up sorely lacking. It can be said that Keynes has done as much with the idea as anyone by generalizing it to the problem of inadequate aggregate demand. But that is a capitalist appropriation of a concept if ever there was one. Baran and Sweezy’s analysis in _Monopoly Capital_ is limited mainly to commentaries on the effectiveness with which capital is able to generate sufficient demand, either through the state or through private markets.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n23) This is a subject of an almost endless mainstream macroeconomic literature.

What of the class content of this theory? At its core, in Marx, is the contradiction between capitalist needs to expand productivity and production under the prod of working-class struggle and the limits on the ability of Department II producers to dispose of that increased production. Capital has tried to cope with this problem, first privately in the high wage strategy of Henry Ford and then through the state in the Keynesian attempt to harness rising wages to induce capitalist growth.

Marxist understanding of the working-class use of these strategies has been sadly disappointing. As we have seen, Baran and Sweezy, like many of their generation of Marxists, considered those workers who succeeded in forcing capital to have recourse to a productivity deal, to be bought off, even participants in the imperial order.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n24) In the case of Critical Theories of consumerist society, this increased consumption appears only as a means of domination.

We, on the other hand, can recognize that while rising wages do not necessarily rupture capitalist accumulation, they do raise the absolute level of working-class consumption and strengthen it in its struggles. And there are neither theoretical nor historical reasons to think that those struggles, in the aggregate, ever cease or can always be harnessed. As a political category, from the standpoint of capital, the wage (or income more generally) does not define exploitation, it hides it. From the standpoint of workers the wage is first and foremost a weapon and a measure of working-class power. In these terms Marx’s comments on the limits to workers’ wages is a commentary on the limits to their power. In these terms, relative surplus value strategies and the Keynesian productivity deals are reflections of the ability of workers to expand that power.

The saddest part of Marxist underconsumptionist theory is its insistence on focusing on the limits to workers’ power rather than on its absolute and relative extent. This is a criticism to which Marx was partially, but only partially, open. His theory of relative surplus value and its recognition of the way workers can successfully expand their wage and their power balances his remarks on the limits to consumption and helps us to keep them in perspective. In the wake of Ford and Keynes, Marx would have no problem recognizing the institutionalization of relative surplus value and analyzing its implications. The failure of contemporary underconsumptionist Marxists to do this is a striking limitation to their work. The analysis of the absolute rise in working class income leads to an understanding of how the struggle for wages, while perhaps bound for a while within capitalist accumulation, can create, and indeed has created, a sufficient base to break free of those constraints and rupture both relative surplus value and accumulation in such a manner as to precipitate crisis. Because they recognize this, the relative shares theorists constitute a decided advance over the class myopia of the under-consumptionists.

### Relative Shares and Class Struggle

Underconsumptionism’s dismal view of workers’ ability to raise their share of value derives, at least in part, from Marx himself. Although his theory of relative surplus value allowed for increases in the standard of living of the working class, his discussion in chapter 25 of _Capital_ and in _Wages, Prices and Profit_ was explicit in arguing that any time workers were able to raise wages enough to undermine profits, capitalists could successfully use crisis and expanded unemployment to force wages down again. While pessimistic, this argument was clearly based on Marx’s observations of nineteenth-century business cycles and the downward flexibility of wages. There is nothing in Marx’s theory that precludes workers achieving enough power to impose downward inflexibility of wages as they did after the Great Depression.

As was noted in the last section, Marx’s theory of relative surplus value certainly allows for the possibility of state management of a link between wage growth and productivity growth-a characteristic of the Keynesian solution to the rise of militant industrial unionism and the social conflicts of the 1930s.

One can also imagine that Marx would not have been surprised to observe that workers, by the late 1960s, after two decades of rising wages, were able through their political recomposition both within and without the factory to mobilize enough power to rupture the Keynesian productivity deal and throw capital into crisis. Although he did not foresee such developments, there is, again, nothing in his theory that precludes them, and there is much that helps us analyze these developments politically.

In the first place, what is called a “profits squeeze” in the relative shares literature takes the form, in Marxian terms, of a fall in the rate of relative surplus value-a clear sign, as the relative shares theorists recognize, of an increase in working-class power in the class struggle.

But two criticisms could be addressed to the profits squeeze theorists. First, although they focused on the factory labor force, their emphasis on accelerating wage growth was not accompanied by an analysis of the other side of the break-down of the productivity deal: the crisis in productivity. This neglect perhaps flowed from their emphasis on the sphere of circulation and their failure to explore the crisis in the sphere of production. Second, their focus on the factory meant that they failed to develop an analysis of working-class recomposition at the level of social capital, that is, an analysis that took account of struggles in the sphere of reproduction and their impact on struggles in the sphere of production.

Both of these aspects of crisis were analyzed by Marxists working within the alternative framework proposed here. Analyses of the way in which class struggle had ruptured accumulation in both production and reproduction was developed by Italian Marxists of the “autonomy” school in the late 1960s and by American Marxists associated with Zerowork in the early 1970s. The first issue of Zerowork containing detailed arguments along these lines appeared in December 1975. The arguments contained in the articles of that issue were historically grounded in case studies of private (auto, coal mining) and public (post office, welfare programs) sectors, of production and reproduction (education, community). In case after case the articles showed how workers’ struggles had grown, circulated, and ruptured accumulation, forcing crisis on capital. Finally, they showed how these struggles created crisis for capital not only at the national but also at the international level. Comparable recognition of the importance of the interrelationship between struggles in production and reproduction later found its way into the writing of the American wing of the relative shares school (Gintis and Bowles, 1982; Piven and Cloward, 1982).

Today, considerable work has been done within the framework of this approach that has undoubtedly contributed to our understanding of the present crisis. To date, however, only the work of the Marxists in the alternative interpretation I have been exploring have rooted their work on the present crisis in a reinterpretation of the theoretical categories of Marx. Whether the relative shares authors will follow their lead remains to be seen.

### Conclusion

To end this essay let us return now to the problem of appropriation raised in the beginning and ask whether, or to what degree, the alternative interpretation of Marxian crisis theory represented here is subject to the same criticism I have leveled at the theories of Marxist economists.

In the formulation and discussion of a political reading of Marx, I have sought a transparent language to discuss the various aspects of class struggles. By adopting a transparent language that makes the political class content of every concept and theory explicit, this kind of exposition would seem to make the material as accessible to capitalist ideologues as to the working class. Does not the form of this interpretation leave it even more open to capitalist appropriation than the jargon of Marxist economists? As far as the choice of language and style is concerned, I think the answer must be positive.

The content of this interpretation, however, is not likely to be of any use to capital. Capitalist ideologues and planners know there is a class struggle. They don’t talk about it because they try to hide its existence. Indeed they have developed their own obfuscating languages to keep it hidden. The working class become “labor” or “human capital.” Class relations are replaced by those between individuals and decision makers. In macro theory the class struggle is reduced to the union bargaining of labor economics. And so on. Therefore, even if they agree with the basic thrust of this analysis, and I think that in their own way some do, they are not going to adopt any of these formulations precisely because they are too transparent!

Capitalist economists know that there are problems in orchestrating the distribution of resources among spheres of production. They have, as we have seen, developed planning models to help them intervene where their micro theory or their experience indicates that market forces are inadequate. Nothing has been said, or is likely to be said, in this approach to Marx that would facilitate that process.

They also know that workers’ struggles push capitalists into the development of new technologies and the reorganization of production. The economists among them may only discuss this in terms of relative prices and marginal rates of technical substitution, but that is just their jargon for analyzing the issue. Industrial engineers, industrial sociologists, and labor-relations experts are all hard at work grappling with the problem and trying to help business manage such change. I do not believe that my formulation of the tendency of the organic composition of capital to rise can teach them anything useful about how to deal with the problem.

Similarly, mainstream economists concerned with macro policies of employment, micro policies of manpower planning, or corporate-level negotiations over job displacement and retraining are all too aware of the problem of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, even though they don’t call it that. As early as 1930 Keynes (1931) had realized the importance of this phenomenon. He spoke of the “new disease” of technological unemployment, of “unemployment due to our discovery of means of economizing the use of labor outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses of labor.” He even saw, as Marx had before him, the possibility of postcapitalist freedom from work. Unlike Marx, of course, he spent the rest of his life trying to preserve capitalism rather than trying to overthrow it.

Later, the acceleration of automation in the late 1950s produced another moment of capitalist, and worker, awareness of this tendency. The solution that emerged was the rise of a more labor-intensive service sector which has absorbed a rising percentage of the labor force and has provided most of the jobs for new entrants during the last twenty years.

More recently, spurred by the rapid advances in automation and robotization, economists and a variety of futurologists have become terribly worried about not being able to find jobs for either the present or the emerging labor force. Although not all of the problems of un- and underemployment can be attributed to labor-displacing technological change, enough are to warrant growing alarm among capitalist planners. These worries, and our opportunities, are particularly great because the new forms of automation are being extended to the service sector as well as to manufacturing.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm#n25)

In short, this reinterpretation of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as a tendency of class struggle to undermine capital’s ability to impose work offers no help to capital because they are already aware of the problem. It does clarify for us about the importance and implications of the struggle against work, and it identifies the misdirections and obfuscations of some Marxist crisis theories.

As to the theory of underconsumption, when we interpret it as one aspect of the contradictions of capitalist accumulation and of the limits to workers’ power, it provides us with a useful argument for justifying wage and benefit increases to provide a spur to “economic” growth. At the same time, it provides nothing new to capital, which long ago absorbed the concept and, through Keynes, discovered how to put it to good use.

As to the considerations of the meaning of rising absolute wages to which the theory of underconsumption can lead, we can draw conclusions quite different from those of either Marxist economists or Critical Theorists. While rising income provides markets for capitalist realization and possible cultural mechanisms of domination, it also leads, even in the case of productivity deals, to changes in the content of workers’ desires for wealth and leisure and to changes in their ability to fight for what they want. Rising wealth leads to increased desire for the time to put it to use. Simultaneously, this improvement of material condition helps workers undercut the relative surplus value strategies of capital. This is a problem capital is again aware of, but one to which too many Marxists have been blind. Once again it points to the centrality of the struggle against work as a Daslc element or worKlng-class strategy.

In the case of the relative shares theory of crisis, I have already pointed out some of its merits as well as some of its limitations. Probably the most important of the latter concerns the failure to ground the theory in the kind of reinterpretation of Marxian theoretical categories I have outlined here. Especially serious is the failure to recognize that the social struggles that have ruptured the productivity deal and brought on the current crisis have had as a central concern the struggle against work and for self-development. Among the social democratic wing of the relative shares theorists this is probably inevitable because there is no evidence that they understand the central function of work in structuring capitalist society, and therefore they do not conceive of the transition to socialism as involving the liberation of human beings from imposed work. They are more inclined to embrace the traditional perspective that socialism is defined in terms of workers controlling work rather than abolishing it. This naturally leads to their preoccupation with “workers’ control” and “economic democracy” (Carnoy and Shearer, 1980; Espinoza and Zimbalist, 1978). This is one reason their politics are social democratic rather than revolutionary. It also illustrates one way capital can use a Marxist crisis theory based on class struggle. If that theory fails to identify and clarify some fundamentally antagonistic quality of the struggle, such as the struggle against work, then it will not escape instrumentalization.

In conclusion, I have tried to demonstrate that while the bulk of Marxist crisis theory has been cast more in the language of economics than in the political language of class struggle, it is still possible to develop an interpretation of Marx wherein his work retains its revolutionary content. It is this approach that holds the only hope of escaping the easily appropriated confines of “economics” and gives us at least a chance to develop Marxist theory as a working-class weapon within the crisis.

### Footnotes

1. So pervasive has the rise of Marxism been in American universities that OIlman and Vernoff have called it a “cultural revolution.’ and documented it in their book _The Left Academy_ (1982). In terms of Thomas Kuhn’s analysis of emerging paradigms, the last few years have seen Marxism achieve all the trappings of recognized academic legitimacy: specialized journals, professional organizations, tenured professors, and credited courses of study.

2. Economists long ago abandoned serious discussion of Marx’s labor theory of value --the theoretical core of most of his work in “economics.” At the threshold of the Marxist “cultural revolution, in the early 1960s, there was only one well-known, tenured Marxist professor of economics in the United States: Paul Baran at Stanford, who died in 1964. As a result, the present generation of Marxists is largely self-taught.

3. When Ollman and Vernoff say, in their introduction to _The Left Academy_ (p. 2), that “a space opened up within the university for critical thinking” we need to remember that we were the ones who carved out that space through our struggles. When the struggle is abandoned the space often closes down dramatically. What has not yet been written in the history of Marxist studies is a serious evaluation of both the strategies that were successful in opening up space and those that were not.

4. The influence of business on the structure and content of American education has been one of the phenomena most thoroughly studied by the new radical Marxist students and professors. See Bowles and Gintis (1975), Spring (1972), and Carnoy (1974). It is the omnipresence of that influence that should make us ask why business would tolerate overtly anti-capitalist Marxist teaching in the university.

5. Marcuse’s analysis of “repressive tolerance” involves the idea that the establishment tolerates difference in order to domesticate and neutralize it, to keep it off the streets and safely tucked away in the cloister of academia (Wolf, Moore, and Marcuse, 1965).

6. The need for new ideas has stemmed from the crisis of theory that has been part of the current economic and social crisis of the system. In economics this has mainly concerned the crisis of the Keynesian paradigm which dominated policy making and academic textbooks for almost thirty years.

7. One important attempt to use Marx to help plan capitalist accumulation was during the 1920s when Soviet economists drew on Marx’s schemes of expanded reproduction to develop models to guide Soviet policy makers. One such attempt by Feldman was interesting enough to draw the attention of Evsey Domar (1957), the well-known Western growth theorist. In the West there has been a parallel history of building on Marx. The seminal moment of this history was the development of input/output analysis by Wassily Leontief, who based himself partly on Marx’ s work. For some assessment of the history and import of this appropriation of Marx see Leontief (1938), the essays in Horowitz (1968), and Kuhne (1979).

8. From about 1970 on the American Economic Association made space in its annual meetings for papers by radical economists or for discussions of the development of Marxist economics. The curious reader has only to peruse the annual May issue of the American Economic Review, which contains the proceedings of the annual meetings, to verify this radical presence. Also see Bronfenbrenner (1970) and the debate around Gurley (1971). Two surveys of Marxist work in the business press are _BusinessWeek_ (1975) and _Wall Street Journal_ (1975).

9. There are two aspects of a theory that influence the facility of its appropriation by capital: its content and its form. If the content of a theory is focused on the same problems as bourgeois theories, if the theory defines its subject the same way bourgeois writers do, comparison and evaluation come easily. If the focus and problematic are different, however, the relevance is not so apparent. Similarly, if the form of analysis is the same, if the language and methods are the same, then even if some core theoretical concepts are different (say, the concept of value), it is easy for mainstream observers to follow the arguments and to look for new insights that might inform their own work.

12. Fe1dman’s model is reformulated and examined by Evsey Domar (1957: chap. 9). This article, also referred to in note 7 above, is paradigmatic for seeing how bourgeois economists sometimes try to learn from Marxists. “It seems to me,” Domar writes, “worth while to explore a growth model constructed on a Marxist foundation, even if modified, and to show its relation to a corresponding Keynesian one. ..it may be o fuse in unraveling a few puzzles in Soviet economic development and in achieving abetter understanding of Soviet economic thinking. It also raises some questions regarding economic development in general” (p. 228).

20. The whole enormous literature of the “transformation problem"--the problem of transforming Marx’s value quantities into prices-- stems from two sources. The first is the one here: the perception that the theory of the tendency refers to monetary rates of profit. The second is the perception that Marxian “economics” should be able to do all that mainstream economics does, especially explain relative prices. The long debate on this issue is rendered irrelevant if we recognize that Marx’s theory has a totally different object from that of mainstream economics. While mainstream economics is designed to provide necessary information to the capitalist and policy maker about the operation of the system, e.g., market prices, Marxian theory was designed to help overthrow the system as a whole. For such different objectives one needs quite different theories. The one should not be judged by the criteria of the other.

21. Much debate has taken place concerning the meaning of the “organic composition of capital and it has had considerable influence on the debate over the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. In _Capital_, however, in both volumes 1 and 3, Marx is explicit that the organic composition is the value composition insofar as it reflects the technical composition-that is, insofar as changes in the organic composition reflect changes in the concrete relations of labor and machinery. See, for example, Marx (1977: chap. 25). Therefore the organic composition rises always and only when capital introduces new machinery to raise productivity. For a discussion of the impact of this on the composition of power relations among workers and between workers and capital see Cleaver (1979: 112-14).

22. Marx’s most vivid and clear statement of this process can be found in the _Grundrisse_ (Marx, 1973: 699-715).

23. In the jargon of macroeconomics, which they sometimes use, they are discussing the limits to raising the consumption function, the investment function, and the government expenditure function in order to increase aggregate demand. See Baran and Sweezy : ; (1964).

24. Among the most vivid of their condemnations can be found in Baran (1957).

25. The literature on the current wave of automation is enormous, but for an overview see the special issue of Scientific American (1982) on “the mechanization of work.”

Marx has frequently been characterized as holding to economic determinism. During his lifetime, in Lenin’s writings, in Stalin’s diamat and the mirroring Western caricature, and in some scholarly books in the last quarter of the twentieth century, Marx and Marxism have been portrayed as presenting a theory in which economic factors determine non-economic spheres of life such as politics, religion, and ideology. Although some texts may appear to support the argument that Marx is an economic determinist (sec. I, below), the economic determinist interpretations of those texts is weak (sec. II) and the interpreter’s use of “economic” is misleading (sec. III). Moreover, when the reader moves from the questions and perspectives of the economic determinist to examine Marx’s project, he does not base his ideas on economic determinism (sec. IV).

### I. The Case for Marx’s Economic Determinism.

Characterizing Marx as an economic determinist is based on some textual evidences. Perhaps the clearest and strongest statement of what is taken as economic determinism occurs in Marx’s “Preface” to his 1859 _Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_:

In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political, and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or -- what is but a legal expression for the same thing -- with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic -- in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. .... This consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production. (MER, 5)

This extensive passage contains some key elements for the economic determinist argument. As he rarely does elsewhere, Marx talks of the “economic structure” and the ideological “superstructure” that rises on it, and how change in the “economic foundation” leads to a transformation of “the entire immense superstructure.” He describes social change as a conflict between “material productive forces” and “existing relations of production.” He insists that the analyst should distinguish between the “economic conditions of production” and the “ideological forms” that men use to describe their positions.

Economic determinists can argue four possible forms of “determinism” from passages in the “Preface.” One determinism refers to the level of the individual: the human will is determined -- i.e., its contents and actions are causally formed by the circumstances in which the person lives. A second operates at the level of human interactions: in some ways the economic causes the political and the ideological. A third “determinism” can be independent or can sum and expand the first two: the course of history itself is inevitable. The fourth “determinism” derives from Marx’s claims that his critique of political economy is a science.

So an economic determinist’s interpretation of individuals in Marx’s system would assert that Marx’s is a deterministic system because it deprives human beings of agency or free will: “men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will.” Marx’s economic laws also seem to leave little scope for freedom, as is suggested in the “Preface,” above, where “economic conditions of production ... can be determined with the precision of natural science” or in Marx’s “Preface” to _Capital_, where he writes of “the natural laws of capitalist production” (MER, 296).

The economic determinist argument about society argues that either the (technological) “forces” of production or the (more broadly economic) “relations” of production (or “forces and relations” of production -- determinists differ here) serve as the causal variable in worldly life, with political and legal structures and ideological formations as the dependent variable, changing in lockstep with technology or economy. The forces, or forces and relations, of production are the locus, then, of all effective change and the cause of all that occurs in human life beyond the realm of production.

Lastly, some determinists argue determinism in history or through science. Some emphasize the inevitability of predictable or predicted historical change, as suggested in the _Manifesto_: “What the bourgeois ... produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable” (CM, I; MER, 483). In private letters Marx could be even more deterministic: on 5 March 1852 Marx wrote that he proved “that the class struggle necessarily leads to the _dictatorship of the proletariat_, ... [and] that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the _abolition of all classes_ and to _a classless society_” (MER, 220). Here Marx seems to be making a straightforward prediction of what will “necessarily” happen. Others note that Marx frequently parallels his interpretations to modern natural science, both in the 1859 “Preface” and throughout his works.

It should be noted that determinist arguments can advocate “hard” or “strong” determinism: that, e.g., a specific set of productive forces “uniquely and directly cause” a specific set of political, legal, and ideological arrangements. Or there is a “softer” determinism, perhaps arguing that the specific set of productive forces causes “in the last instance” the superstructural elements. The text of the 1859 “Preface,” as well as other texts, has been used to support a range of determinisms from soft to hard.

### 2. The Myth of Economic Determinism.

But economic determinism in Marx’s thought is a myth. I argue against the economic determinist argument in three ways in this and next sections. One way of arguing, which I shall try to avoid most (but not all!) of the time, is to hurl quotations at your opponents hoping they have the power of Zeus’s lightening-bolts. Battles between opposing quotations rarely solve any disputes (or, rather, any disputes they solve have been long settled), if only because a quotation (like any fact or piece of evidence) requires an interpretive context if it is to understood and placed with other quotations (and their interpretations) into a larger theory.

I do want to suggest, therefore, some interpretive issues related to the economic determinist interpretation of the 1859 “Preface.” The determinist’s claim that Marx’s system undermines free will seems argued only in a limited manner. Two arguments stand out, but on examination neither seems able to bear the weight of determinism. One suggests that human beings live in circumstances that exist independent of (and prior to) their will. But this seems to me to be a sociological truth for social theorists of all ideological stripes: we live in a world whose institutions, practices, and languages are pre-constituted by those who have lived before us, a constitution that is independent of our wills and that shapes our wills. Marx stated as much (but with a different emphasis from the “Preface”): “Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past” (18thB, I; MER, 595). Marx seems to be suggesting that the already-constituted social world provides a context that limits the ways in which we can make our own history; he does not seem to be saying that the already-constituted social world so causally determines each one of us that, instead of making history, we are merely reacting to external causes that drive us.

The second argument for determinism, which builds on Marx’s statement about life determining consciousness, overlooks that statement’s peculiar twist. Marx engages frequently in a kind of contrapuntal statement, where he denies a left-wing Hegelian slogan and then presents his view as the reverse. But Marx’s aphorism -- “It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness” -- presents its assertion asymmetrically. Having denied the left-wing Hegelian stance that consciousness determines being, Marx reverses the terms but adds “social” -- and “social being” is not defined but seems to be more extensive than merely forces (or forces and relations) of production and indeed as “social” likely includes consciousness

Marx’s starker statement in _The German Ideology_ -- “life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life” (MER, 155) -- does not add “social” but does present its own asymmetry. The left-wing Hegelians, _pace_ Marx, think that consciousness determines life, as though consciousness were something independent of life, standing apart from it (like an individualized _Geist_-like spirit) and shaping it. But Marx in this section rejects the view of consciousness as independent of life (so that he goes on to reject that philosophy can be “an independent branch of knowledge”). Rather, he is trying to make consciousness a part of human life. So, when “life determines consciousness,” Marx is tautologically asserting, as part of his on-going argument, that life (a totality including consciousness) determines consciousness (because it is a part of life). As he himself writes, when we see that “life determines consciousness,” “the starting point ... is real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as _their_ consciousness” (MER, 155). So these statements do not deny free will so much as they put human consciousness into an intimate relation with other aspects of human life.

Some determinist interpreters insist that in Marx the economic -- the forces, or forces and relations, of production -- determines political, legal, and ideological institutions and structures. Indeed, it is important to Marx to emphasize (against philosophers and others who would ignore) the importance of the economic; and so it should be expected that Marx will mention frequently and give weight to economic factors. But giving weight to economic factors is far from determinism as causality, especially far from strong causality. And some of his mirrored statements also suggest how far from unidimensional causality Marx is: “circumstances make men just as much as men make circumstances” (MER, 165).

The words that Marx uses should indicate how far from causality he is. The English translation conveys the feel of the German, and in a set of places where Marx could use “cause” (were he giving a monocausal, strongly causal, or even partially causal explanation of how economics causes non-economic factors), he uses instead “rises,” “correspond,” “conditions,” and “is ... transformed.” When the legal and political superstructure “rises,” “definite forms [note the plural] of social consciousness” “correspond” to it. Despite the frequent treatment of this paragraph of the 1859 “Preface” as deterministic, its language does not prima facie demand the theory of economic determinism.

Marx does suggest, I think, that forms of consciousness such as ideology are limited in what can be thought -- perhaps in parallel to the way that the circumstances into which we are born limit how we make history. Marx wishes to “explain” consciousness “from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production” (MER, 5). What human consciousness does is to try to understand the world. When social life is calm, so are ideologies; when class conflicts come into existence, so too do competing ideologies and conscious statements (CM, I; MER, 481); and only when a revolutionary class arises can revolutionary ideas come into being (MER, 173). To suggest limitations, however, seems very different from asserting causal connections.

Marx gives a fascinating specific example of limitation when he discusses the equality of value in commodities. He praises Aristotle for having clearly enunciated a number of basic principles about the money-form, value, and the requirement that exchange take place with equality and commensurability. Aristotle has attained many insights necessary for Marx’s economics.

There was, however, an important fact which prevented Aristotle from seeing that, to attribute value to commodities, is merely a mode of expressing all labour as equal human labour, and consequently as labour of equal quality. Greek society was founded upon slavery, and had, therefore, for its natural basis, the inequality of men and of their labour-powers (CI, 59-60).

So Aristotle could not see the equivalence of human labour -- and that equivalence cannot be discovered “until the notion of human equality has already acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice” (CI, 60). Aristotle’s range of thinking is limited by the practices of his society. But to me such limitation is far from determinism.

Economic determinism suggests historical determinism: inevitability and predictability. But most of Marx’s statements about the historical inevitably are in especially rhetorical works, like the _Manifesto_, or in minor documents (like his 1852 letter). When Marx is not trying directly to foment revolution, inevitability yields to judicious assessment; and in minor documents Marx’s opinions vary according to circumstances and audiences.

In both minor and major works it is striking how little and how rarely Marx claims an inevitable course for the future or predicts it. Those who seek to find a blueprint of the future society in Marx search in vain for a document that Marx did not produce. Enticing comments he did write. In _The German Ideology_, he stated that

in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming a hunter, fisherman, shepherd, or critic (MER, 160).

He echoes that thought at various places in _Capital_ (C3, 820; MER, 441) but nowhere does he articulate an institutional context or psychological dynamics for that vision. The closest, perhaps, that Marx comes to a blueprint of the future is in the _Manifesto_’s “ten points” that “in the most advanced countries ... will be pretty generally applicable” (CM, II; MER, 490). But that list of 1848 Marx and Engels explicitly evaluated in their “Preface” to the 1872 English edition:

The practical application of the principles will depend ... everywhere and at all times, on the historical conditions for the time being existing, and, for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section II. That passage would, in many respects, be worded differently today (MER, 470).

Rather than be a blueprint or a prediction, then, the ten points -- like so much else of what Marx wrote about the future -- depends on the specific historical conditions of the present out of which that future shall grow.

Moreover, when Marx analyses the present, he seems to do so in a way that emphasizes particularity and detail. It is difficult, I think, to read _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon_ or his _Herald-Tribune_ articles without appreciating Marx’s attention to the specifics of history and his attempt to recognize the novelty, contingency, and variety of current events. In _The Communist Manifesto_, the “executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie” (CM, I; MER, 475); four years later Marx writes about a very different kind of state in _The Eighteenth Brumaire_, one in which the individual President panders to almost all classes to support himself in power. (There are in all cases economic laws of motion which undergird the state, but, as Marx quotes a reviewer at one point, with all laws we look for the variations of the law as well as its uniformity [CI, Afterward to the Second German Edition; MER, 300]. The state executive varies from one country to another according to its economic formation, historical factors, and particularities.)

Despite the parallels that Marx draws between his critique of political economy and natural science, a careful examination of how Marx also contrasts them shows basic differences between Marxism and natural science. For instance, Marx refers to both chemistry and physics in the “Preface” to _Capital_’s first edition. Marx states that physics uses observation and experiment; but observation is of only limited usefulness for Marx’s economic analysis. To observe a commodity -- Marx’s example is a coat -- does not help in seeing the (exchange) value of a commodity; examine a commodity as much as you like, wear it until it is threadbare, and you still cannot see its value: “the coat is a depository of value, but though worn to a thread, it does not let this fact show through” (MER, 316). While chemistry uses “microscopes and chemical reagents,” Marx must use the “force of abstraction,” and, for instance, in his examination of the coat abstract from its physical properties to its status as an exchange value whose value determined by human labor time; “so far no chemist has ever discovered exchange-value either in a pearl or a diamond” (MER, 328). In brief, “a commodity appears, a first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood. Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties” (MER, 319).

Marx’s attempt to attain systematic knowledge of the commodity in all its relations and meanings is far removed from the methods and goals of modern natural science.

### 3. The Myth of Economic Determinism, cont.

Because the interpretation is labeled “economic determinism,” it might also be useful to think about the terminology. “Economic” is in some ways an odd term for economic determinists to use, because it tends to shift the emphasis from “forces and relations of production” to a reified sphere of human activity that, though changeable in its specific contents, scope, and power, gains an unchanging stability in the term “economic.” Much better to think in terms of “forces of production” and “relations of production.” These terms are not so susceptible to reification because of their specificity: they cover a less wide range than “economic” and refer to specific aspects of the full economic process. Consequently, using “forces” and “relations” of “production” makes it easier to think that they might change.

They also lack a clear and distinct meaning that sharply delineates them from other factors. Indeed, are the forces of production just tools and machinery? or are they the work force whose productivity varies depending on how it is organized? do the forces of production include the imaginative undertakings that modernize the forces? Relations of production is if anything more ambiguous: are they merely the relations of social labor? as social interactions, do relations have to include communication and consciousness, ideas and ideologies? what about political and legal relations that regulate social interactions? Marx’s terminology, when delved into, suggests that any single dimension of production is intimately related to other dimensions.

So too “economic” tends to ignore “labor” and “needs,” and in doing so occludes central human characteristics. For Marx human labor is a central category of economic analysis and a central dimension of our humanity:

Labour is, in the first place, a process in which both man and Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates, and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature. He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces, setting in motion arms and legs, head and hands, the natural forces of his body, in order to appropriate Nature’s productions in a form adapted to his own wants. By thus acting on the external world and changing it, he at the same time changes his own nature. He develops his slumbering power and compels them to act in obedience to his sway. (MER, 344)

“Economic” is too bloodless and abstract to emphasize such labor, activity, development, and transformation of individual and society.

Finally, “economic” makes it difficult to imagine a future society, which will not have an “economic” sphere -- especially not one governed by the natural laws of capitalism -- even though there will of course be a realm of necessity, whose scope and specific requirements will vary and “beyond it begins the development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom” (C3, 820; MER, 441). So “economic” seems to be a reified, unitary, and static concept, that prevents us from seeing clearly the many relations and dimensions it includes and implies.

### 4. An Alternative View of Marxism

Even on their own grounds and using their own terms, the arguments of the economic determinists about Marx do not seem cogent, powerful, or convincing. The strongest arguments against Marx’s purported economic determinism, however, do not meet the determinists on their own grounds and their own interpretations of Marx’s texts. Economic determinist presentations require their authors to slight or ignore important dimensions that constitute Marx’s theoretical achievements and practical importance. In other words, even as they pick out good quotations from Marx’s corpus, the economic determinists ask the wrong questions and consequently look for the wrong answers. Imposing _their_ questions on Marx, they ignore Marx’s questions. Marx does not focus on -- indeed, he does not even address -- the issue of whether human beings have free will. He is not attempting to create a causal (or monocausal) theory of human life, similar to theories in chemistry and physics, which allow for causal statements and scientific prediction. He is not concerned with causality or inevitability in history.

Marx, rather, thinks of human beings as active creators and shapers of their natural and social worlds who find their scope for free action drastically constrained by systems of private property and especially capitalism. He is concerned with the relations among forces of production, relations of production, and consciousness, but he is concerned to see those relations as an interrelated coherent totality in which human beings live and to present that totality in a systematic manner. Throughout his writings Marx is dialectical, looking at how practices (and the concepts that represent them) develop and change over time and in interaction with other practices.

Marx’s dialectic does not involve any kind of “thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis” triad: he nowhere uses that language. Nor does he use the language of cause-and-effect. Rather, what Marx’s dialectic involves is a careful analysis of the categories of bourgeois and human society. Just as Hegel begins his _Science of Logic_ with the simplest logical (or mental) category he can imagine, being, and then analyses it to pull from it all the meanings inherent in it, so too Marx begins _Capital_ with the commodity, the basic category of capitalist society, and analyses it. The progress of _Capital_ cannot be seen as “thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis,” if only because there is no anti-thesis to the commodity that produces a clear synthesis; but the progress is rather the detailed articulation of the meaning and implications of the commodity. When Marx discusses money in the opening chapter, he does so in the terms that he has been using for commodities, to show how money is a logical outgrowth of commodities (and not, for instance, a conventional invention by human beings nor merely a historical development in economic history). Given Marx’s method of progressive articulation, it cannot be said that the “commodity” causes capitalism, or money, or the fetishism of commodities, or exchange: all of these categories are bound up with the commodity, and their meanings are explored as Marx explores the meaning of commodities; but the relation is not one of cause-and-effect but rather of inter-connected categories. (One cannot have capitalism without commodities, for instance, but it would be strange to say that extensive production and circulation of commodities causes capitalism; rather, both phrases are synonymous, emphasizing different aspects of the same economic formation.)

Dialectical reasoning does allow for fluidity and development: it allows for them in part because in any articulation of a concept the dialectician needs to follow wherever the logic demands, and so what appears as an early conclusion may be modified at later stages, dead ends can appear to require a change in focus, and the articulation of a social product can lead to conflict or contradiction. For instance, as Marx works out the implications of labor time and the length of the working day in capitalism, he notes that, in the exchange that is wage labor, “the capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working-day as long as possible” and “the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working-day.” In the heart of capitalism “There is ... therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides” (MER, 364). Dialectic can both portray capitalism as a system and a conflict within capitalism that might destroy it.

Portraying capitalism as a totality -- by which Marx means a self-forming, structured, and evolving whole, that can have within itself contradictions and conflicts, forces of stability and openings for change -- is another important part of Marx’s social theory. In his discussion of method in the _Grundrisse_, Marx talks about how he is studying “a rich totality of many determinations and relations” (MER, 237).

Capital volume I presents such a totality. Even though it presents only the first of a promised four-book work, in _Capital_ Marx presents the self-forming of capitalism on its own terms in “So-called Primitive Accumulation.” Most of the book is devoted to discerning and portraying capitalism as a structured, interconnected social formation in which the major elements are related to each other. In that presentation, Marx omits much. He leaves until later the circulation of capital (MER, 298). He discusses national differences briefly. He talks some of the ideological life of capitalism: he notes that “for a society based upon the production of commodities ... Christianity with its _cultus_ of abstract man ... is the most fitting form of religion” (MER, 326) and in a paragraph of imaginative rhetoric suggests that the ideology of “Freedom, Equality, Property, and Bentham” descriptively replicates the sphere or simple circulation (MER, 343). Of the psycho-social implications of capitalism, he says at one point:

It is not the place, here, to go on to show how the division of labor seizes upon, not only the economic, but every other sphere of society, and everywhere lays the foundation of that all engrossing system of specialising and sorting men, that development in a man of one single faculty at the expense of all other faculties, which cause A. Ferguson, the master of Adam Smith, to exclaim: ‘We make a nation of Helots, and have no free citizens’ (MER, 394).

Not “here” but elsewhere in Marx’s writings the social -- and political and legal -- aspects of capitalism are discussed; what Smith includes in his political economy, Marx includes in his, and more.

Finally, capitalism as a totality is evolving. Capitalism includes contradictions and conflicts, as is indicated by the conflict between capitalist and worker about the length of the working day, a conflict of “right versus right” redolent of the conflicts in ancient Greece between Creon and Antigone and within the _Oresteiea_, conflicts which for Hegel signals the decay of Greek ethical life. Even in the more simple analysis of _The German Ideology_, the potential for conflict and change is inherent in any economic formation: “these three moments, the forces of production, the relations of production, and consciousness, can and must come into contradiction with one another” as long as the division of labor exists (MER, 159).

Capitalism also displays intimations of the future. From Marx’s tantalizing passages, two may be worth examining briefly.

Modern Industry ... compels society, under penalty of death, to replace the detail-worker of to-day, crippled by life-long repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to a mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the different social functions he performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers (MER, 413-14).

However terrible and disgusting the dissolution , under the capitalist system, of the old family ties [through child labor, e.g.] may appear, nevertheless modern industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of relations between the sexes (MER, 415).

(One comment about technical or economic determinism: note that “modern industry” is doing the compelling and creating a new foundation, not some future technology; and in that future, built on modern industry, relations of production and social relations will be very different. In other words, while the forces of production remain recognizably similar to contemporary modern industry, the social relations of the future are significantly different from those of the present.) What Marx is indicating, I think, is that in current productive processes and practices can be seen the possibility of drastically transformed productive, social, developmental, and other relations: capitalism is a totality, and part of a totality usually includes possibilities for change. What Marx analyses are not isolated pieces of capitalism, but capitalism as an inter-related “ensemble of social relations” (TF, 6; MER, 145), in which the detailed analysis of any component requires that at some point it be re-placed in the totality.

When Marx presents capitalism as a totality using dialectics, his “science” is an interpretive science whose elements are systematically connected -- “science” in the sense of Hegel’s _Wissenschaft_, not modern natural science. Appearances deceive, and analysis must burrow through them:

the final pattern of economic relations as seen on the surface, in their real existence and consequently in the conceptions by which the bearers and agents of these relations seek to understand them, is very much different from, and indeed quite the reverse of, their inner but concealed essential pattern and the conception corresponding to it (C3, 209).

“All science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided” (C3, 817), and Marx’s goal is to discern that historically created and changing essence and to present it in a systematic, scientific manner.

For Marx human activity is central. When Marx in _The German Ideology_ goes back to the “first premise of human existence” to ask what human beings are like, he sees that “the first historical act is ... the production of the means to satisfy ... needs, the production of material life itself”; from that follows the “second point,” “that the satisfaction of the first need ... leads to new needs.” Human beings then begin to interact with each other, form families and other social relations, and develop consciousness (MER, 155-60).

Marx distinguishes his materialism from all previous materialism, in which “the thing, reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the object or of _contemplation_, but not as _human sensuous activity, practice,_ not subjectively”; so a materialism like Feuerbach does “not grasp the significance of ‘revolutionary,’ of practical-critical activity” (TF, 1; MER, 143). Objects that he sees -- like cheery-trees in France, are an “historical product, the result of the activity of a whole succession of generations” (MER, 170). In the _Manifesto_, Marx praises the bourgeoisie because “it has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about” (CM, I; MER, 476). And the long quotation above from _Capital_ about labor is yet another presentation of human beings as active beings who transform nature and themselves by their activity.

Of course human activity always has occurred under constraints; in a society with a division of labor,

Man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him .... This fixation of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us, growing out of our control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now. (MER, 160).

Marx spends three-quarters of a page in _Capital_ (I, 645) summarizing just some of the constraints, limitations, and convolutions imposed by capitalism. Human beings are and always have been active beings, but they have always had to act under severe constraints.

Marx wishes to abolish, as much as possible, those constraints. Active human beings, able to unify with others in the class, formed by the Communist Party and become gradually more conscious of their goals, can revolt against capitalism, overthrow it, and remove these alien limits in order to liberate human activity and unfetter human development. In the place of the myth of economic determinism, Marx’s theory presents the interpretation of a complex, dynamic totality by a careful dialectic, an interpretation that shows that active human beings can by revolution transform the world, tear down alien structures and powers, and build on the potentials of modern industry.

### Bibliographical Note

For the most powerful and cogent arguments that Marx in some senses is an economic determinist, see the following three books, whose common date of publication constitutes an interesting coincidence:

Cohen, G. A., _Karl Marx’s theory of history : a defence_ (Princeton : Princeton University Press, 1978);

McMurtry, John, _The structure of Marx’s world-view_ (Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1978);

Shaw, William H., _Marx’s theory of history_ (Stanford, Calif. : Stanford University Press, 1978).

The classical arguments against the Second International, Leninist, and (German) SPD views of Marx as an economic determinist can be found, most famously, in:

Lukács, György, _History and class consciousness; studies in Marxist dialectics_ trans. by Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press,1971).

Other important Eastern European interpreters of Marx after the Russian Revolution who were open to seeing him not as an economic determinist include:

Karl Korsch, _Marxism and philosophy_, trans. and introd. by Fred Halliday (New York, Monthly Review Press, 1971);

Rozdolski, Roman, _The Making of Marx’s ‘Capital’_, trans. by Pete Burgess (London : Pluto Press, 1977); and

I. I. Rubin, _Essays on Marx’s Theory of Value_ (Detroit: Black and Red, 1972).

More recent works include:

Avineri, Shlomo, _The social and political thought of Karl Marx_ (Cambridge : University Press, 1968), and

Ollman, Bertell, _Alienation: Marx’s conception of man in capitalist society_ (Cambridge, University Press, 1971).

For a further development of some of my arguments, see:

“Marx’s Enterprise of Critique,” in J. Roland Pennock, ed., _Marxism_ (NOMOS Series; New York: New York University Press, 1983), pp. 252-76.

In addition, just about any interpretation of Marx finds itself tending to one side or the other in the debate about economic determinism. As many have suggested, it may well be that those who come to Marx via economics or Engels tend to see him as an economic determinist, whereas those who come to Marx through Hegel (or come to see the importance of Hegel in his thought) see him not as an economic determinist.

Today, increasing numbers of people are struck by the suspicion that Marx was not the man we all thought, but very few are aware how far the ‘Marxist’ picture was from the reality. Many think that Marx may be judged by the comprehensiveness of his ‘complete’ works. Not many are conscious that his difficulty of finishing any one of his projects was a sign of his essential incompleteness of his overall task: the construction of communism. Unlike his devoted followers, he was not prepared to let revolutionary impatience stand in the way of clarity.

Let us begin with Lenin, with the early work, ‘What the Friends of the People are’. Lenin writes:

“We do not say to the world,” Marx wrote as far back as 1843, and he fulfilled this programme to the letter, “we do not say to the world: ‘cease struggling, your whole struggle is senseless’. All we do is to provide it with a true slogan of struggle.”

That is what Lenin wrote in 1893, and meant it all his life. But this is what Marx wrote in 1843:

We do not say to the world: Cease your struggles, they are foolish; we will give you the true slogan of struggle. We merely show the world what it is really fighting for, and consciousness is something that it _has to_ acquire, even if it does not want to.

Lenin did not intend to distort the words of Marx, but was incapable of imagining such a humanist thought possible for the founder of ‘Marxism’.

So here we have two programmes, the programmes of Marx and Lenin : on the one side, ‘Marxism’, on the other, the figure of Karl Marx. The former holds that ‘Marxism’ is a certainty, an unlimited collection of truth, or as Lenin, echoing Plekhanov, put it, ‘a complete, integral world outlook’, ‘cast from a single sheet of steel’. To the latter, on the contrary, it is an organic growth.

In 1843, Marx was just beginning. As he told Karl Kautsky a lifetime later, he couldn’t publish his collected works, because they had not been written. (That was in 1882.) In 1843 he had not yet developed his notions yet of class struggle, of the dictatorship of the proletariat, of value. But already the notion was present of a truly human world. At this stage he thought of himself as a Feuerbachian. But Feuerbach was some kind of materialist. For such thinkers, the world existed, and we had to make our thoughts conform to it, and by ‘thought’, the materialists mean no more than activity of a single, isolated human head. But Marx, while — partially — agreeing with Feuerbach in his criticism of Hegel, has nothing to do with him in his conception of society. His discoveries of the proletariat and of communism are unaffected by Feuerbach.

When he writes his _Comments on James Mill_ (1844), he is quite clearly _not_ a ‘materialist’:

If then our mutual thraldom to the object at the beginning of the process is now seen to be in reality the relationship between _master_ and _slave_, that is merely the _crude_ and _frank_ expression of our _essential_ relationship. Our _mutual_ value is for us the _value_ of our mutual relationships. Hence for us man himself is mutually of _no value._

The object cannot be seen as merely an ‘object’, but only as a social product. As such it is not merely something which affects the ‘thought’ in my head or yours, but which is a link between us and everybody else. But this is in contradiction with our human being.

Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. ... I would have been for you the _mediator_ between you and the species, and the other person. ... and therefore would become recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion of your own essential nature and as a necessary part of yourself, and consequently would know myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love.

When he came in 1845 to write his _Theses on Feuerbach_, he could launch an attack on materialism: The very first _Thesis_ begins:

The chief defect of all previous materialism (that of Feuerbach included) is that things [_Gegenstaende_], reality, sensuousness are conceived only in the form of the _object,_ or of _contemplation_, but not as _sensuous human activity, practice_, not subjectively. Hence, in contradistinction to materialism the _active_ side was set forth abstractly by idealism — which, of course, does not know real, sensuous activity as such — Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, really distinct from conceptual objects, but he does conceive objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as _objective_ activity. In _Das Wesen des Christentums_ he therefore regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice is conceived and defined only in its dirty-Jewish form of appearance. Hence he does not grasp the significance of ‘revolutionary’, of ‘practical-critical’ activity.

And _Thesis_ 3 returns to the subject:

The materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and that the educator must himself be educated. This doctrine must, therefore, divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [_Selbstveraenderung_] can be conceived and rationally understood as _revolutionary practice._

The point is that Marx is not a philosopher. He is a _critic_ of philosophy. That does not mean that he disagrees with this or that philosophy, but that he takes the questions that philosophy asks and shows that the answers are to be found by relating the questions to the contradictions of society.

Marx had learned from Hegel one lesson which he never forgot: putting in front of society a ‘slogan’, a formula, a set of ‘sectarian principles’ with which to make the world correspond is not the point. The social formation Marx strove for all his life was a human society, which he fought to release. While he respected the work of Fourier and Owen, he saw it as foreshadowing the Communism that arose from the sufferings of the proletariat itself.

In 1859, Marx published _Critique of Political Economy_, Part 1. (There was no Part 2. _Capital_, Volume 1 was published eight years later.) The Preface to the _Critique_, which Marx used to summarise his views, is noteworthy, among other reasons, for its complete failure to mention the topics we have been talking about. Instead, he refers to the ‘the social production of the being’, and contains the celebrated — and much misunderstood — account of relations of production relations and productive forces. I would only like to point out that the whole of this passage ends with the statement that ‘the pre-history of human society accordingly closes with this social formation’.

The distinction between human productive forces and social relations of production, the key point in Marx’s whole outlook, is ignored by the ‘Marxists’. They simply cannot see what all the fuss is about. Communism, which turns on the re-unification of these two, is beyond them.

Let us jump a few decades, to 1873. In the _Afterword_ [_Nachwort_] which he wrote to the Second Edition of _Capital_, Marx felt it necessary to reply to a reviewer of the First Edition on the question of the method of the book and its relationship to that of Hegel:

My dialectical method is, in its foundations, not only different from the Hegelian, but the direct opposite to it. For Hegel, the process of thinking, which he even transforms into an independent subject, under the name of ‘the Idea’, is the creator of the actual, and the actual is only the external appearance of the idea. With me, the reverse is true: the ideal is nothing but the material reflected and translated in the mind of man.

And he goes on to contrast the dialectical method and its role in history in Hegel’s case and in his own.

‘Marxist’ translators have gone to great lengths to make this look like ‘materialism’. The best to date is Penguin translation, due to Ben Fowkes:

With me, the reverse is true: the ideal is nothing but the material world reflected in the mind of man, and translated into forms of thought.

The Untermann translation is much more direct:

With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.

Eden and Cedar Paul give the following:

In my view, on the other hand, the ideal is nothing other than the material since it has been transposed and translated inside the human head.

Marx’s original is as follows:

_Bei mir ist umgekehrt das Idealle nichts andres als das in Menschenkopf ungesetzte und ubersetzte Materialle._

What these people miss, is the meaning of Hegel, and without that, there was no possibility of recognising the message of Marx. In everybody up to and including Kant, the pair ‘form’ and ‘matter’ confront of each other, and there is no way of proceeding from one to the other. Hegel was the first person to break away from this, and Marx does not go back on it. For the translators of _Capital_, being ‘materialists’, the Kantian standpoint is the most advanced they can reach. (Kant himself, was able to see, dimly, the contradictions in this. From then on, the attitude of most thinkers was pre-Kantian.) Marx is inverting Hegel without returning to the earlier point of view. Hegel’s ‘Mind’ (or ‘Spirit’ [_Geist_]) is far from the ‘Marxist’s’. His meaning comprises at least as much as his understanding of ‘world’, and Marx’s use of this word never ignores that of Hegel. What eludes Hegel’s grasp is that with the victory of the proletariat the revelation of the meaning of the history places the true significance of Mind in the heads of the individuals of the whole of society.

This appears to be strange time to rediscover the true heritage of Marx. Bush and Blair, along with their counterparts Bin Laden and Putin, seem to have things their own way. How can anyone can imagine that human life could be so different? Well, the works of Karl Marx, if we decide to read them as they were written, can indicate a direction we might take.

_The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics_ of 1987 represented the distilled wisdom of the economics profession. The article on ‘Karl Marx’ was written by the leading Marxist theorist of the day, Ernest Mandel. This multi-volume work included enough articles on Marxism to enable a separate volume on it to be extracted and published, _The New Palgrave: Marxian Economics_, 1990, in which Mandel’s overview had pride of place. He referred to ‘what Marx calls “simple commodity production” – “_einfache Waren-produktion_”.’[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n1) In this, quasi-official expression was given to the most enduring myth of Marxology.

For Mandel was following a very long tradition. Paul Sweezy in his much-used classic textbook _The Theory of Capitalist Development_ stated ‘Marx begins by analysing “simple commodity production”...’[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n2) (Notice the quotation marks, but, as with Mandel, unsupported by any actual reference.) Earlier, in the thirties, Oskar Lange, in explaining Marx’s theory of value, said Marx starts with such a notion: ‘Marx calls it “_einfache Warenproduktion_”.’[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n3) A later authority, R. L. Meek, in his 1967 essay on ‘Karl Marx’s Economic Method’ alleged Marx had a model ‘he called “simple” commodity production’[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n4).

But the simple truth is that Marx never called anything  _‘einfache Warenproduktion’_; the term cannot be found in his writings.[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n5)

Who, then, introduced it? The term occurs in Engels’s Preface and Supplement to his edition of _Capital_ Volume III, and it was interpolated by him into the text itself (as keen-eyed readers can deduce from the editorial brackets surrounding the passage containing it).

In his _Preface_ Engels claimed that at the beginning of Volume I of _Capital_ ‘Marx takes simple commodity production as his historical presupposition, only later, proceeding on this basis, to come on to capital’: the advantage of this was that he could proceed ‘from the simple commodity and not from a conceptually and historically secondary form, the commodity as already modified by capitalism’.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n6) This is in fact a _misreading_: Marx _never used the expression ‘simple commodity production’_ in _Capital_. Likewise, it is certain he never referred to the capitalistically produced commodity as a secondary derivative form.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n7) Marx certainly does not develop the idea of ‘simple commodity production’ at the point where it was supposed to be under discussion, namely the first few chapters.  Rather, as the first sentence of Volume I makes clear, the simple circulation discussed in the first few chapters is that of the capitalist economy.

The only occurrence of the term ‘simple commodity production’ in the whole three volumes of _Capital_  occurs in Volume III, but this is in a passage given to us subsequent to Engels’s editorial work, as he himself warns us in a note.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n8) It is now possible to check this against the manuscript itself, which has been published in the new _Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe_ (MEGA). It is clear that the entire paragraph was inserted by Engels (as, indeed, was the one on the next page about capital’s ‘historical mission’).[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n9) Later in the text Engels also inserted the phrase ‘and commodity production in general’.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n10)

It is not very usual for an editor to impose his own reading on the text. Why, then, did Engels do it? The reason can be established with some precision. However, first let us note that Engels’s cast of mind was primarily historical. In his review of Marx’s 1859 _Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_ he put forward what came to be known as the ‘logical-historical’ method (another term Marx never used, by the way). When he responded to the first proofs of _Capital_, he reacted to the proposal to add a special appendix on the value-form by urging that this take the shape of a proof from history.[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n11)  (Marx ignored this advice.) However, when Engels came to write Prefaces to _Capital_ I in 1883, 1886, and 1890 he did not suggest that the first part was historical. Nor did he refer to ‘simple commodity production’ in his Preface to Volume II. It was only in 1894 in the Preface to Volume III that he came up with the idea in the context of judging what has been called ‘the prize-essay competition’ (in which people had been challenged by Engels, in his Preface to Volume II, to solve the problem of generating a uniform rate of profit on the basis of the law of value). This gives us the requisite context for understanding Engels’s intervention.

Engels became involved in the discussion of ‘simple commodity production’ because it seemed that in the third volume of _Capital_ Marx abandoned the law of value in favour of another principle of price determination. Of course, in Marx’s procedure values are a stage in the process of generating the Volume III ‘prices of production’. But, if such values are not _empirically_ present because they are superseded by these prices of production, are they not merely fictitious? Engels reacted to this possibility by interpreting the stages of Marx’s presentation _historically_ in order to ensure that the values were indeed empirically visible, but, of course, in the _past_, before capitalism ‘modified’ the relationships involved.

Thus, when in response to _Capital_ Volume III Conrad Schmidt put forward the thesis that the ‘value’ discussed in Volume I is a ‘necessary fiction’, Engels wrote to him arguing that value is real enough for practical purposes at the stage of ‘simple commodity production’.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n12)  The day before writing to Schmidt, Engels had written to Werner Sombart in much the same vein, arguing that ‘value had a _direct and real existence_’ at the time ‘when commodity exchange began’, but ‘this direct realisation of value ... no longer happens’, for ‘the value of the capitalist mode of production ... is so thoroughly hidden’.[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n13) So strongly did Engels feel about this that he wrote a special paper on the subject, which was placed  as a Supplement to the second edition of _Capital_ Volume III. He was there concerned to dispel any doubt that ‘what is involved is not just a logical process but a historical one’. After developing the point at length, he concluded that ‘Marx’s law of value applies universally, as much as any economic laws do apply, for the entire period of simple commodity production, i.e. up to the time at which this undergoes a modification by the onset of the capitalist form of production.’[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n14)

It is true that Engels was able to cite a passage from the manuscript of the third volume in which something like the content of the idea of a stage of simple commodity production was mentioned by Marx. Seizing enthusiastically on this, Engels claimed that ‘if Marx had been able to go through the third volume again, he would undoubtedly have elaborated this passage significantly’[[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n15): however, it is just as possible he would have decided it was a false trail and eliminated it! Certainly, odd references in _Capital_ to pre-capitalist production are not used with any _systematic_ intent.

Engels, Sweezy, and Meek, all (wrongly) believed _Capital_ starts with ‘simple commodity production’, however they characterised its status. For Sweezy the virtue of ‘simple commodity production’ was its theoretical clarity as the starting point for a logical derivation, not its supposed empirical reality as part of a ‘corrected history’ as it was for Engels. Meek went for an ambiguous middle position: ‘simple commodity production’ was not a _myth_ he argued but _mythodology_.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n16) But the belief Marx began with something ‘he called simple commodity production’ is the real myth!

Generations of students have been taught Marxist economics on the basis of a distinction between capitalist production and ‘simple commodity production’. Yet this approach descends from Engels, _not Marx_. To turn to the present, let us look at the most widely read popularisation of Marx’s economics: Ben Fine’s _Marx’s ‘Capital’_. This has been through four editions since 1975 and has been reprinted many times. As late as the third edition of 1989 there still occurs the flat statement ‘Marx called such a situation simple commodity production.’[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n17) Only in the fourth edition of 2003 is this modified to ‘often termed simple commodity production’.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n18) The most commonly used English edition of _Capital_ today has an Introduction by Mandel which says that Marx could not start with capitalist production, i.e. ‘generalised commodity production’, because this springs, logically and historically, from ‘simple commodity production’.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n19)

How did it happen no one ever actually looked to see if Marx said Part 1 was about simple commodity production? On the face of it there seems no ready explanation for such an extraordinary failure of scholarship. The explanation is that behind this myth lies another: that Marx and Engels were the same person! (the greatest testimony to which is the absurdity of the _Collected Works_ of 50 volumes devoted to two authors who hardly ever published joint works). Meek, in all his work, was absolutely unselfconscious about treating Marx and Engels as one person. Throughout, he quoted freely from Engels when purporting to give Marx’s views. For example:

‘I still think I was right in laying special emphasis on Marx’s “logical-historical method”: indeed, if anything I think I underestimated the extent to which Marx’s economic work was guided by it.... Marx’s _logical_ transition in _Capital_ (from the commodity relation as such to the “capitalistically modified” form of this relation) is presented by him as the “mirror-image” of a _historical_ transition (from “simple” to “capitalist” commodity production)...’.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n20)

The ‘by him’ in this remark is simply false, because all the quoted material in this passage is not from Marx but from Engels.

However, if Engels in his Preface took it for granted everyone knew Marx started with simple commodity production this may have been because of Karl Kautsky’s little book _Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx_.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n21) This appeared in 1887, and was an immediate success selling 5000 copies straightaway.[[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n22) In this, “simple commodity production” is mentioned in the first chapter.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n23) There are also references to it throughout the last chapter. Undoubtedly Kautsky’s interpretation had a continuing influence; for the book was reissued many times. But it would be hasty to assume that Kautsky invented the term. Engels drew Kautsky’s attention to the importance of ‘simple commodity production’ as early as a letter of June 26th 1884.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n24) So priority lies with Engels.

It is evidence of the enormous authority of Engels, as interpreter of Marx’s meaning, that the standard textbooks for so long repeated his view of the matter.

Now, pity the situation of the ‘orthodox’ indexer. Since Engels said so, it must be true that Part 1 of _Capital_ I deals with simple commodity production: but there is no mention of it! This did not prevent Dona Torr, for example, indexing no less than twenty pages of Volume I under the head ‘Commodity Production, Simple’ —if there are no references invent fictitious ones! This was in a 1938 edition of _Capital_ based on a reissue of Engels’s edition. Anyone today who attempts to follow up my remarks about ‘simple commodity production’ themselves will discover a very strange fact. In the Marx-Engels _Collected Works_ the three volumes of _Capital_ are indexed together at the end of volume 37. When consulting this index one finds that there is one reference to ‘simple commodity production’ directly and another in relation to capitalist production. Both of these are to pages of Volume I, but _nothing of the kind appears there_. By contrast, the three occurrences of the term in Volume III, mentioned above, are _not_ listed. (How can anyone conduct research on this basis!) The solution to this mystery is that this index has been compiled simply by zipping together the existing indexes of the separate volumes previously put out by Moscow; a few false entries have been deleted, but no attempt has been made to achieve concordance. The indexes to Volumes II and III were compiled in the fifties for the Foreign Languages Publishing House. The person who compiled the index for Volume III evidently thought the term ‘simple commodity production’ not worthy of mention (an interesting fact in itself). Volume I, published in 1954, did not have a subject index at all; but when the three volumes were brought out again by Progress Publishers Volume I was supplied with an index later; this time the person responsible put in a couple of fictitious entries.

It is to be regretted that the indexes of the new MEGA editions of _Volume One_ also make concessions to the myth of ‘simple commodity production’. For the first edition (1867), MEGA lists _‘Warenproduktion – einfache’_ and gives three page references. But on none of these pages does the term _‘einfache Warenproduktion’_ appear, and in my opinion nothing corresponding to its meaning appears either. However when MEGA gives the original manuscript of _Volume Three_ it  does not list the term in its index – very rightly.

Here I have dealt with a strictly philological issue. Behind that lie interpretative issues, and substantive ones. I believe in both Engels is seriously misguided. However, it is open to anyone to support Engels’s reading in one or both respects. But in future I hope such people will not refer to ‘what Marx called simple commodity production’, but to ‘what Engels called simple commodity production’.

I have argued elsewhere that Engels’s reading of _Capital_ is wrong-headed.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article2.htm#n25) But, if so, how did it happen that the myth went unchallenged? While the authority of Engels was important in this, there must have been a predisposition present in readers of _Capital_ to find the concept of ‘simple commodity production’ congenial. There are three considerations I offer to explain this.

a) The first generation of Marxists, such as Engels and Kautsky (who were also enthusiastic about Darwin), believed that Marx made a uniquely powerful contribution to the critique of political economy insofar as he systematically differentiated between modes of production on a historical basis. Capitalism was a historically specific social formation. They confused this genuine insight of Marx’s with a methodological imperative to explain things in terms of historical origins and development, albeit suitably dialecticised. What this missed was the possibility that Marx intended a rigorously _logical_ ordering of concepts, employing not a historical dialectic but a _systematic dialectic_ of the kind found in Hegel’s logic, wherewith an abstract beginning is sequentially concretised.

b) The following generations of Marxists included those educated in ‘Economics’ departments, who absorbed a different methodology, namely modelling. They naturally ‘found’ in _Capital_ a number of such ‘models’, beginning with ‘simple commodity production’. They read the book as a sequence of more and more complex models, approximating more and more to the real object.

c) By the time _Capital_ appeared Hegel was a ‘dead dog’ to such an extent that nobody was in a position to understand and assess Marx’s somewhat nuanced acknowledgement of his influence. Dialectical thought of the kind found in _Capital_ was no longer familiar, even to scholars. Even if Marx had provided more guidance in a suitably didactic methodological introduction, readers would have found it difficult to fathom. Without it, they were lost. The _Afterword_ Marx put in the second edition of Volume I certainly raises more problems than  it solves. This suggests to me that Marx was not himself clear about the issues. The ‘hiddenness’ of the systematic dialectical method in the argument itself may not merely be in the interest of popularisation; to some extent it must have been hidden from Marx himself. Any attempt to recover it may well require some reconstruction of the argument.

But that takes us well beyond the simple point I am making in this article.

There is a widely held view that Marx was profoundly influenced by the Master–Servant (‘_Herrschaft und Knechtschaft_’) dialectic in Hegel’s _Phenomenology of Spirit_. This view was first popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre, who refers in his _Being and Nothingness_ (1943) to ‘the famous Master-Slave relation which so profoundly influenced Marx’.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-1) Sartre does not explain how he knows this.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-2) Probably this remark reflects the influence of Alexandre Kojève’s lectures on Hegel in the nineteen-thirties. Kojève presents a reading of the _Phenomenology_ which centralizes the place of the Master–Servant dialectic in it, in a quasi-Marxist interpretation.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-3) (Kojève may have assumed that Marx himself read it in the same way. However, it is one thing to read Marxism back into Hegel, it is another to generate it _out_ of Hegel.) Three years after Sartre we find Jean Hyppolite again saying that the dialectic of domination and servitude is the best-known section of the _Phenomenology_ because of ‘the influence it has had on the political and social philosophy of Hegel’s successors, especially Marx’.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-4)  As a matter of fact, despite the assertions of numerous commentators to the contrary, Sartre and Hyppolite did _not_ attend Kojève’s lectures. The myth that they sat at the feet of the ‘unknown superior’ is now well-established, but the secondary literature concerned does not give any evidence for it.[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-5) Let us turn then to first-hand accounts. Kojève’s disciple Raymond Queneau, who was responsible for collecting and publishing Kojève’s lectures in 1947, has given a list of participants which does not include Sartre or Hyppolite.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-6) As far as Hyppolite is concerned we have the additional testimony of Mme. Hyppolite[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-7) that he did not attend ‘for fear of being influenced’.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-8)

However that may be, by the time Sartre and Hyppolite made their equations between Hegel and Marx a crucial document of Kojève’s was already in the public domain. In the 14 January 1939 issue of _Mesures_ Kojève published a free translation, with interpolated glosses, of the section of the _Phenomenology_ entitled ‘Autonomy and Dependence of Self-consciousness: Mastery and Servitude’. Still more interesting for our purposes is that Kojève includes as an epigraph the following words of Marx: ‘_Hegel ... erfasst die_ Arbeit _als das_ Wesen, _als das sich bewährende Wesen des Menschen_’.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-9) (‘Hegel ... grasps labour as the essence, as the self-confirming essence of man’.) No reference is given, but in fact this is quoted from Marx’s _1844 Paris Manuscripts_, which remained unpublished until the nineteen-thirties. Kojève is the first person, therefore, to make a direct connection between this famous judgement of Marx’s on Hegel and the Master–Servant dialectic in the _Phenomenology_.

Today it is dogmatically asserted in numerous books that Marx was inspired by Hegel’s analysis of the labour of servitude.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-10) This view is completely false. The present note attempts to show that this is so and to explain the real significance of Marx’s critical appropriation of the _Phenomenology_.

If we are to consider the influence of Hegel’s _Phenomenology_ on Marx, the crucial text to examine has to be Marx’s manuscripts of 1844, in which he introduces his theory of alienation, and then devotes considerable space to a penetrating critique of the _Phenomenology_. In this latter section Marx praises Hegel for having grasped man as the result of his own labour. Nearly all commentators, innocently assuming that _material_ labour is meant here, turn to the _Phenomenology_ and find that there is indeed a fascinating discussion in the ‘Master–Servant’ section of the significance of material labour; in and through this the servant ‘finds himself’. Furthermore, the fact that this labour is seen by Hegel as actualized in the context of servitude, leads some commentators to make the more extravagant claim that in his theory of alienation Marx draws on this same section. Herbert Marcuse was probably the first to do so; he says in his _Reason and Revolution_ (1941): ‘In 1844, Marx sharpened the basic concepts of his own theory through a critical analysis of Hegel’s _Phenomenology of Mind_. He described the alienation of labour in the terms of Hegel’s discussion of master and servant.’[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-11)

The only difficulty with these presuppositions of the secondary literature is that Marx _never refers_ to this section of the _Phenomenology_—never mind giving it any importance!—when, in his 1844 manuscripts, he embarks on a ‘critique of Hegel’s dialectic’. He discusses the _Phenomenology_ as a _whole_ and draws attention to its last chapter especially; he singles out three other sections for praise; but not one of them is on the master–servant dialectic.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-12) This should make us suspicious, therefore, of the claims made for the ‘master–slave’.

Before considering Marx’s assessment of the _Phenomenology_ let us rehearse the dialectic of _Herrschaft und Knechtschaft_. (Incidentally, although it is popularly nominated the ‘Master–Slave’, the correct translation of _Knecht_ is ‘servant’.[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-13)) This section occurs early in the _Phenomenology_ at the point where consciousness is to turn into self-consciousness. Hegel believes that the self can become conscious of itself only in and through the mediation of another self-consciousness. The first stable relationship that emerges in Hegel’s dialectical development of this topic is that of Lordship and Bondage. The master is acknowledged as such by his servant, and he achieves immediate satisfaction of his desires through goods and services provided by the servant’s labour. The dialectic moves forward precisely through the servant, however, because ‘through work ... the bondsman becomes conscious of what he truly is’. Work forms and shapes the thing, and through this formative activity the consciousness of the servant now, in the work outside it, acquires ‘an element of permanence’; for it comes to see in the independent being of the object ‘its _own_ independence’. ‘The shape does not become something other than himself through being made external to him,’ says Hegel, ‘for it is precisely this shape that is his pure being-for-self.’ He concludes: ‘Through this rediscovery of himself by himself, the bondsman realizes that it is precisely in his work wherein he seemed to live only the life of a stranger [_fremder Sinn_] that he acquires a sense of himself [_eigner Sinn_].’[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-14)

These terms are superficially comparable to Marx’s in that both Hegel and Marx see work not merely in its utilitarian aspect but as a vehicle of self-realization; thus they see the servant rather than the master as the locus of a more developed human existence. However, fundamental differences between Marx and Hegel become obvious when we notice that, whereas Marx holds that only a change in the mode of production recovers for the worker his sense of self and its fulfilment, Hegel thinks that the educative effect of work, even within an exploitative relation of production, is _sufficient_ for the worker to manifest to himself his own ‘meaning’ in his product. Furthermore, at this stage in the phenomenological dialectic, the condition of ‘fear and service’ is stipulated as _necessary_ to this end: that is, to the servant’s becoming objective to himself.[[2024-08-15]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-15)

Hegel defines work as ‘desire held in check’: it involves putting a distance between the immediate impulses of self-will and formative activity grounded in _objective principles_. If you like, it is really the master who is a slave because _his_ object is the ‘unalloyed feeling of self-satisfaction’: that is to say, he is a slave to his appetites, but his satisfactions are ‘only fleeting’, lacking the permanence of objectivity.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-16) The servant on the other hand, in the work he creates, achieves mastery of his craft; it is he who rises to the level of universal human reason. However, Hegel introduces the notion that ‘fear and service’ are _necessary_ to induce the check to desire and to ensure that consciousness rises above self-centred goals to the freedom that comes from a consciousness of the ‘universal power’ of human creative activity.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-17) Quite arbitrarily, apparently, Hegel assumes everyone must undergo breaking of self-will through subjection to an alien power before being capable of rational freedom.[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-18)

Let us now examine the crucial passage in Marx’s complex discussion of the _Phenomenology_, in which Marx praises Hegel for grasping the importance of labour. ‘The great thing in Hegel’s _Phenomenology_ and its final result—the dialectic of negativity as the moving and producing principle—is that Hegel conceives the self-creation of man as a process, objectification [_Vergegenständlichung_] as loss of object [_Entgegenständlichung_], as alienation [_Entäusserung_] and as sublation [_Aufhebung_] of this alienation; that he therefore grasps the nature of _labour_ and conceives objective man ... as the result of his own labour ... The realization of himself ... is only possible if man ... employs all his _species-powers_ ... and treats them as objects, which is at first only possible in the form of estrangement [_Entfremdung_].’[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-19)

Does such a judgement—as Kojève insinuates and so many later writers boldly assert—rest on Hegel’s discussion of the labour of servitude? The first thing that should give us pause is that immediately after this praise Marx qualifies it by complaining that ‘the only labour Hegel knows and recognizes is _abstract mental_ labour’.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-20) The servant’s labour is clearly _material_, so this remark shows that not only has Marx not drawn on that analysis, but he has actually _forgotten_ all about it and done Hegel a minor injustice![["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-21)

What Marx _does_ refer us to is ‘the closing chapter of the _Phenomenology_ ... (“Absolute Knowledge”)’, which ‘contains the concentrated essence of the _Phenomenology’_ and its dialectic.[[22. Juli 2024 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-22) It contains the upshot of its whole movement. The ‘abstract mental labour’ to which Marx refers is the _labour of spirit_. The _Phenomenology_ is a spiritual odyssey, or, perhaps, a _Bildungsroman_ of spirit, in which spirit discovers that the objective shapes given to it in consciousness and self-consciousness are nothing but its own self-determination. Spirit comes to know itself through _producing_ itself, in the first instance as something which stands over against itself. In the final chapter, Marx notes, the world of estrangement thus brought to life is overcome, or negated, in a peculiar way in that—as Hegel puts it—‘self-consciousness has sublated this alienation [_Entäusserung_] and objectivity ... so that it is at home with itself in its otherness as such’.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-23) Within this framework spheres of estrangement such as religion, the state, civil society, and so forth, are grasped as spirit’s own work. Hegel emphasizes that spirit can come to itself _only through_ setting up opposition and then negating it. This is ‘the labour of the negative’ as he calls it.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-24)

When Marx refers to ‘the final result’ of the _Phenomenology_ being ‘the dialectic of negativity as the moving and producing principle’, it is to this _entire labour of spirit_ in the _Phenomenology_ that he refers. Of course, in Marx’s view man produces himself through material labour. It would be a mistake, however, to assume therefrom that he praises Hegel for what he says about material labour such as that of the servant. When Marx says Hegel grasps labour as the essence, he is talking not about what Hegel _actually says about material labour_ (hence the lack of reference to ‘Lordship and Bondage’) but about the esoteric significance of the dialectic of negativity in spirit’s entire self-positing movement (hence Marx’s claim that the only labour Hegel knows is abstract mental labour). Marx sees in Hegel’s dialectic of negativity the hypostatization of the _abstract reflection_ in philosophy of the _material process_ whereby man produces himself through his own labour, a process which (Marx concurs with Hegel) must pass through a stage of estrangement.

It is necessary to locate the ‘Master–Slave’ within this perspective of spirit’s development of its self-awareness. As we have already noted, and now stress, it is an _early_ moment in the story of spirit’s recovery of itself. It is much less ‘concrete’ (in Hegel’s terminology) than cultural achievements such as law, art, religion and philosophy.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-25) Nonetheless, it is located at a turning point of some importance, for the problem Hegel faces is how to develop dialectically self-consciousness out of the mere consciousness of external objects. Consciousness cannot grasp itself in things. It must distinguish itself absolutely from them through their radical negation. The consumption of objects of desire accomplishes this in an evanescent way. To risk one’s life in forcing another consciousness to grant one recognition represents a more promising mediation. But the master finds himself frustrated in reducing the vanquished to his servant, his thing. Self-consciousness can only gain proper recognition through mutual respect such as that accorded to individuals constituted in the legal and ethical relations Hegel develops later in the story.[[26]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-26) At this stage the dialectic advances through the despised servant. As we have seen, he ‘finds himself’ through the negating action of work on things. However, it must be stressed that the point of this is that it brings about an advance in self-consciousness.

This does not have much in common with Marx’s interest in the realization of an objective being in forming the material world; but it is of a piece with the project of the _Phenomenology_ as a whole. It is worth noting that in Hegel’s _Encyclopaedia_ ‘Phenomenology’ no mention is made of the worker finding himself in his product; the emphasis in the outcome of the ‘Master–Slave’ there is on ‘community of need’ and ‘fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom’.[[Marxisme og feminisme - Hvorfor klassekamp er kvindekamp-1721231827486.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-27) As far as the _Phenomenology of Spirit_ is concerned, as it is a _spiritual_ odyssey it is quite wrong to place special stress on this moment of material labour (as is the case with the overly ‘Marxist’ readings of Marcuse and of Kojève), for its importance lies not in the material result but in the spiritual one. The next stage in the dialectic is that, since self-consciousness lacks unity here in being split between different ‘selves’, it attempts to find its ‘freedom’ in ‘thinking’; objectivity is ‘negated’ in the pure universality of thought in the attitudes Hegel identifies with Stoicism and Scepticism.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-28) This ‘freedom’ of inner life is compatible with any social position—as Hegel says.[[Familien, Privatejendommen og Statens oprindelse-1721231670829.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-29)

Does Marx, as Marcuse claims (above), follow in his theory of alienation the terms of Hegel’s Master–Servant relationship? We have already said enough to cast doubt on this. Furthermore, not only does Marx himself not refer us to this section, but Hegel’s own discussion in it does not mention alienation. It is obvious that immediately material labour is not as such a problem for Hegel just because it is material, as might be supposed.[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-30) Contrary to this, Hegel gives it an affirmative significance in the development of spirit. It is perfectly true, however, that Marx finds in Hegel the theme of alienation (_Entäusserung_) and estrangement (_Entfremdung_)—but he does not find it in the labour of servitude. Even those commentators who light on Hegel’s chapter ‘Spirit in Self-Estrangement’ (‘_Der sich entfremdete Geist_’) are only partially correct. It is true that Marx makes favourable reference to some of this material; he says: ‘these separate sections contain the _critical_ elements—but still in estranged form—of entire spheres, such as religion, the state, civil life and so forth’.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-31) However, in these sections we are dealing with a realm of finite spirit, referred historically to the period from feudalism, through the Enlightenment, to the French Revolution. Marx mainly concerns himself, not with this so much, but with spirit’s movement of ‘_absolute negativity_’, and especially with the final chapter ‘Absolute Knowledge’ (and when he mentions the _Encyclopaedia_, it is the Absolute Idea and its alienation of itself in nature that he discusses).

A complicating feature in discussing these issues is that translations of texts by Hegel, and by Marx, may give either or both of ‘_Entäusserung_’ and ‘_Entfremdung_’ as ‘alienation’. However, in Hegel these terms are widely separated in the text and have _different functions_. We have just mentioned the chapter on _Entfremdung_. ‘_Entäusserung_’, as Lukács point out,[[32]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-32) is the key concept in the upshot of the _Phenomenology_: spirit grasps the sphere  of estrangement as the product of its own self-alienation. _Entfremdung_ stands to _Entäusserung_ as phenomenological _result_—a state of being—to the active _process_ of spirit’s positing of itself in otherness.[[33]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-33)

While Marx was impressed by Hegel’s phenomenological description of estrangement, what really excited him was the ‘metaphysical’ aspect of the _Phenomenology_—spirit mediating itself with itself in alienation (_Entäusserung_). This is the process of ‘_absolute negativity_’ and it is to this Marx refers when he says that, albeit in mystified form, Hegel grasps man as the product of his own labour, through alienation and the overcoming of alienation.

Nevertheless, Marx holds that Hegel’s discussion of the problematics of alienation is embedded in speculative illusions, and because of this it is a ‘merely apparent criticism’, shading over into ‘uncritical positivism’. In this connection one must draw attention to the sophisticated use of quotation by Kojève in the above-mentioned epigraph to the effect that Hegel grasps labour as the essence. The passage from which Kojève quotes is as follows (with Kojève’s ‘quote’ stressed): _‘Hegel_ adopts the standpoint of modern political economy. He _grasps labour as the essence, the self-confirming essence of man_; he sees only the positive and not the negative side of labour. Labour is man’s coming to be for himself within alienation [_Entäusserung_] or as alienated man.’[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-34)

Why does Marx qualify his praise of Hegel in this way?

Firstly, despite the wealth of content in the _Phenomenology_, everything is treated under the form of consciousness or self-consciousness. This means that a change in consciousness abolishes estrangement because estrangement itself is understood only as an attitude adopted by consciousness. This ‘abolition’ leaves everything in _reality_ as it is. Thus the critical apparatus issues in ‘uncritical positivism’.[[35]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-35)

Secondly, since the ‘subject’ of the movement is ‘spirit’, Hegel cannot conceive of _objectification_ except as resulting in estrangement—hence he substitutes for the category of objectification (_Vergegenständlichung_) that of alienation (_Entäusserung_—which, like _Vergegenständlichung_, has the connotation of positing as objective but which also implies the relinquishment of what is manifested, constituting therefore an alienation).[[36]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-36) Nonetheless, Hegel sees something _positive_ in this process[[37]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-37) because in this alienation spirit becomes objective to itself. It is an _essential moment_ in spirit’s self-actualization and self-awareness. Hegel is not, then, _opposed_ to objectification, on the grounds that it leads to estrangement. He certainly thinks that it _does_ lead to estrangement, but this does not mean that he thinks spirit should rest content in itself and avoid the misfortune of alienation from itself. However, instead of a real _historical_ solution we are provided with a displacement of the problem into general philosophical reflection issuing in a solution posed exclusively _within philosophy_, which preserves estrangement (‘otherness as such’) as a moment in the absolute. This is his ‘merely apparent criticism’ (Marx[[Den eneste vej-1721248553862.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-38)). In truth, Hegel’s equation of objectification and alienation makes him _uncritical_ of the estrangement brought to life in spirit’s self-actualization. That is to say, Hegel, in common with modern political economy, grasps labour as the essence of human development but not as alienated from itself in capitalist society because, if one is unable to posit a genuine historical negation of the negation, the existing conditions become the horizon which blocks off the possibility of a critical standpoint. In fact, these conditions which twist and distort the objectification of man in and through labour are endorsed as the necessary groundwork within which the coming-to-be of man for himself must occur. The world of estrangement is presented as labour’s absolute self-expression.[[Den spanske borgerkrig og revolution (1930-39) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/chris-arthur/article.htm#foot-39)

In conclusion, one can say that focus on the master-slave dialectic reflects two biases. First: one must remark in Kojève, and Hyppolite, the beginnings of the ‘existentialist’ reading of the _Phenomenology_ with its absurd over-emphasis on the ‘life and death struggle’, and its outcome in ‘Lordship and Bondage’—as if the remaining six hundred pages of the _Phenomenology_ were merely an afterthought! Second: while Marxist discussion used to lean towards immediately _political_ problems such as that of domination and class struggle, the diffusion of texts such as the _1844 Manuscripts_, the _German Ideology_, and, more recently, the _Grundrisse_, has made possible a serious discussion of _ontological_ questions; hence the influence on Marx of Hegel, and of his _Phenomenology_, must be differently interpreted.

However, Desan gives no evidence.

26. Jonathan Rée draws my attention to the fact that Hegel is not really discussing _individuality_ here, and _a fortiori_ not social relationships. Hence there is no discussion of master–master or slave–slave relations. We are concerned here with consciousness _in general_ as against objects.

27. _Op. Cit._, paras 434–35. By contrast, in the _Phänomenologie_ Hegel said: ‘Albeit fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom, consciousness is not therein aware of being self-existent. Through labour, however, it comes to itself ’ (p. 115). And on the next page: ‘For the reflection of self into self the two moments, fear and service in general, as also that of formative activity, are necessary... .’

29. ‘Whether on the throne or in chains ... its aim is to be free’. _Op. cit_., p. 117.

30. Ernest Mandel says (_Formation of the Economic Thought of Karl Marx_, London 1971) that for Hegel material labour is alienating ‘because labour is, _by its nature_, the externalizing (_Veräusserung_) of a human capacity, which means that man loses something that previously belonged to him’ (p. 155). Mandel seems to have in mind para. 67 of Hegel’s _Philosophy of Right_ which deals with the _Veräusserung_ (= alienation in the sense of sale) of human powers. If so, this is a complete misrepresentation of Hegel’s text. So far from labour ‘_by its nature_’ having an alienating import, Hegel again in the _Philosophy of Right_ gives the ‘forming of things’ (para 56) a role in actualizing freedom. For Hegel, however, human freedom is more real in _alienating_ things through contracts. When he faces the problem that freedom of alienation is used to sell human capacities—physical and mental skills inherent in the person—this is achieved ‘through the mediation of mind which reduces its inner possessions to ... externality’ (para. 43). In virtue of the _temporal_ restriction on such alienation in wage-labour, the labour-power sold acquires ‘an external relation’ to the substance of the labourer’s personality and he remains a free subject notwithstanding it (para. 67). It is clear, then, that Hegel does _not_ say labour ‘_by its nature_’ as ‘externalizing’ is alienating; rather, he says complex social _mediations_ achieve alienation through setting labour in an (artificial) external relation to the person. (For a full treatment see my ‘Personality and the dialectic of labour and property—Locke, Hegel, Marx’ _Radical Philosophy_ 26, 1980.)

The myth to be discussed here was given its purest expression by John Plamenatz when he asserted that ‘Marx often called ideology “false consciousness”’.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-1) Not surprisingly, Plamenatz cites no instances of this usage, as, in truth, Marx never calls ideology ‘false consciousness’. Indeed, he never calls anything ‘false consciousness’, a phrase that does not occur in his work. The standard of Marx scholarship in English has, it must be admitted, greatly improved since Plamenatz’s time. No serious commentator today would propose a relationship in the terms he employs with such assurance. There is, nevertheless, a sense in which the shadow of the false consciousness connection still looms large over the subject. This may be illustrated by the work of two later writers, both of whom recognise that Marx does not himself speak of ‘false consciousness’. Moreover, both have been highly influential and are representative of distinct general tendencies. Jorge Larrain, while eschewing the language of ‘false consciousness’, maintains that Marx identifies ideology with cognitive distortion in the specific sense of the concealment of social contradictions.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-2) Terry Eagleton for his part believes that this language will serve to characterise not Marx’s sole conception of ideology but rather one he held among others.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-3) In general, it may be suggested, the dominant view in the literature is that Marx should be credited with an understanding of ideology as necessarily involving what is cognitively defective or deficient, in being illusory, deceptive, partial, distorted or at any rate failing in some way to present a veridical picture of the social world. This is the myth which the present discussion seeks to expose.

It should be said by way of preliminary that the association of ideology and cognitive deficiency is now so widespread that it must be assumed to serve a deep need of the age, the need for a concept that collects items in virtue of just that sort of deficiency. No objection will be raised here to the devising of such a concept, or to labelling it ‘ideology’. What will be argued is simply that the ascription of the result to Marx is entirely gratuitous. It has generated what may properly be called a ‘myth’ in one familiar sense of the term, a systematic, internally coherent, imaginative construction that lacks any rational foundations. In matters of exegesis the foundations required are a grounding in the testimony of the relevant texts. The discussion will show that there are no such grounds in the present case. Thus, its aim is merely negative. It will not seek to put forward a positive, and necessarily disputable, interpretation of what Marx means by ‘ideology’ beyond whatever is directly conveyed by the textual evidence that will be cited.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-4)

An important aspect of this evidence might be captured, without undue strain, by remarking that Marx never calls ideology anything. We have to deal not just with the kind of reticence that is evident in the case of such concepts as ‘class’ and ‘dialectic’. The difficulty here is still more basic in that Marx never manages even to set the scene for an attempt at conceptual explication since the bare substantive ‘ideology’ hardly figures at all in his work. The noun is almost always accompanied by an epithet such as ‘German’, ‘republican’, ‘political’ or ‘Hegelian’, or by a qualifying phrase, as in ‘the ideology of the bourgeoisie’ or ‘the ideology of the political economist’. More typical in any case is the adjectival usage in which such varied items as ‘forms’, ‘expressions’, ‘phrases’, ’conceptions’, ‘deception’, and ‘distortion’ are said to have an ‘ideological’ character. Even more distinctive is the frequency, amounting to approximately half of all references in the relevant range, of invocations of the ‘ideologists’, the creators and purveyors of the ideological forms. It is in general almost impossible to exaggerate the concrete, conjunctural nature of Marx’s dealings with the ideological, in marked contrast to the abstractions that characterise the later debates.

Thus, one should not expect to find in Marx’s writings a definition, even in a veiled form, of ‘ideology’. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to assume that they will provide some clues as to the nature of the general considerations that control his use of the term. The most important of these is to be found in a text in which, it is generally agreed, he reaches unusual heights of methodological self-consciousness, the ‘Preface’ to _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_. There he describes the conflict between material forces and relations of production and goes on to refer to the ‘legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic---in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out’.[[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-5) What is most striking about this reference for present purposes is that so far from associating ideology with cognitive deficiency it associates it rather with cognitive achievement, the ‘becoming conscious’ of the fundamental social conflict. It is an association which, to put it mildly, has not been allowed its due weight in the interpretative literature. Moreover, it is far from unique among the occasions on which Marx offers some guidance as to the main lines of his thinking in this area. Thus, in _The Communist Manifesto_ we learn that, when the class struggle nears its decisive hour, ‘a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole’.[[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-6) The natural reading is surely that these thinkers raise themselves to theoretical comprehension of the historical movement as a whole just in their role as bourgeois ideologists. It also seems natural to suppose that this achievement is what triggers their going over to the other side in the class struggle, a move that presumably brings that role to an end.

In the light of these passages anyone suffering the burden of the prevailing myth might be tempted to conclude that, so far as Marx’s explicit guidance goes, ideology is true consciousness. As a slogan this at least would have the merit of having some basis in the evidence of the texts. By itself, however, it could never amount to more than a misleading, if for a limited purpose salutary, paradox. This is shown, to look no further, by Marx’s all too frequent references to bourgeois ideologists who remain mired in incomprehension of the historical movement as a whole. The correct conclusion is surely that, for Marx, ideology is conceptually compatible with both theoretical comprehension and incomprehension. This is to suggest that ideology is not, for him, an epistemological category of any kind. In more concrete terms he is, it may be said, indifferent to questions of truth status in deciding to designate items as ‘ideological’. To attempt to say more positively what his linguistic practice is determined by would, however, go beyond the limits of the present discussion.

What has been attempted here is a summary account of the direction in which the textual evidence points. It is time to consider more closely the relationship between that evidence and the view that was characterised above as ‘mythical’. For it is not to be supposed that those who propagate, or fall victim to, that myth do so without some reassuring sense that the weight of Marx’s writings is to be reckoned on their side. Even if this support is at best a matter of misleading appearances, the appearances still have to be revealed as such and, so far as space allows, traced to their roots. They are rooted in part, it might be suggested, in a degree of confusion. The confusion in question may itself arise from another feature of Marx’s dealings with the ideological, their overwhelmingly forensic and polemical character. In practice, he tends almost exclusively to be concerned with ideological forms he wishes to criticise and reject, above all with elements of the ideology of the bourgeoisie. This is not quite uniformly the case. Thus, when he writes of the ‘ideological superstructure’ of the ‘proletarians’, one would need to be firmly in the grip of myth to suppose that he intends a criticism.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-7) Nevertheless, it may be that the rather consistently hostile tone of his references to the manifestations of ideology has, so to speak, tended to rub off on the concept itself, creating a negative aura around it. If so, this could be only a matter of association and slippage of ideas, not of inference. For it is plainly one thing to characterise particular ideological beliefs as deceptive or distorted and quite another to conclude that ideology as such necessarily partakes of deception and distortion, thereby inflating a contingent circumstance into a conceptual truth. Moreover, so far from supporting such a conclusion, Marx’s quite frequent references to ‘ideological deception’ and ‘ideological distortion’ rather point away from it. For, if it were true, they would have a pleonastic character from which they could be rescued only by supposing that a contrast is intended on the occasions of their use with ‘non-ideological’ deception and distortion. Such a suggestion is, however, so lacking in vitality and resonance in the context of Marx’s work that it has never figured significantly in the literature. It seems that the prevailing myth may be tacitly relying in some degree on vagueness and unclarity with regard to the way the texts bear on it, on unexamined assumptions that turn out on examination to be untenable.

A sense of there being massive support held in reserve, without needing to be called up on any particular occasion, may help in some measure to explain a curious feature of the prevailing view, the fact that so often its advocates seem to experience no need to provide any textual warrant at all. It is any rate the case that it tends to be taken for granted, not made the object of self-conscious scrutiny or seen as a contentious doctrine in need of justification. Yet it would not be quite true to say that no attempt is ever made to adduce evidence on its behalf. At this point, however, the task facing an attempt at the exposure of myth can be drastically simplified. For over and over again, when, so to speak, the pressure is too great to ignore, it is a particular passage that is called into service, the well-known passage with the image of the _camera obscura_ from _The German Ideology_. It may be reduced to its working parts for present purposes in the form of a single sentence. This is standardly translated as follows:

‘If in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a _camera obscura_, this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process.’[[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-8)

It may be that the quickest way to show how little support this sentence actually lends the prevailing myth is to draw attention to a matter of translation. The key phrase rendered above as ‘in all ideology’ is in the original ‘in der ganzen Ideologie’.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-9) On linguistic grounds, however, it seems more natural to render this combination of definite article, adjective and noun by some such phrase as ‘in the whole ideology’. Such a rendering would make clear that what is in question here is the totality of a particular ideology or that ideology taken ‘as a whole’. If read in this way there is only one possible candidate, the ideology that is the central and, so to speak, eponymous concern of _The German Ideology_. The reading fits well not just with the overall context of the work but also with the specific thrust of the sentence in which the key phrase appears and with the immediate context of that sentence. For Marx is concerned here not with cognitive defect in general but with a specific, even if large-scale, error. This is the reversal in German idealism of the true order of priority of ideas and material reality. The image of things being ‘upside-down’, ‘standing on their heads’, (_auf den Kopf gestellt_) is a standard recourse of Marx in characterising his relationship with Hegelianism, and indeed may be taken as an echo of phrases in Hegel’s own work. Marx is far from thinking that the image is serviceable in characterising a wide range of other thinkers such, for instance, as Adam Smith, Ricardo, Bentham and the older French materialists, who, nevertheless, seem uncontentiously to count for him as ideologists. Thus, he does not think of it as capturing a defining feature even of bourgeois ideology, still less of ideology as such.

The sense of a specificity of reference is reinforced by the immediate continuation of the sentence that was quoted above. It assures us that that ‘In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven’. This encourages the suggestion that the chief point of the key sentence may be condensed as follows: ‘Even if the entire German ideology gets things upside-down, this can be explained in materialist terms’. It might be thought that the kind of materialist explanation on offer is fairly crude, and destined to be superseded in the course of Marx’s development, in view of the way it seems to assimilate a complex, socially mediated process to a simple natural one. This does not, however, affect the conclusion to be drawn for present purposes. This is that the _camera obscura_ passage offers a reflection on a feature of a particular ideology, not a conceptual remark about ideology as such. The passage now falls back easily into its place within the consistent texture of the parent work as a whole, no longer seeming to aspire to a meta-level of self-consciousness alien to it. Any appearance of supporting the dominant view has thereby vanished and it is left without a basis in Marx’s work.

The discussion should seek by way of conclusion to trace the false consciousness theme to its source. This is to be found beyond all question in Engels:

‘Ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces’.[[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-10)

It would be idle to deny that some conceptual connection is being proposed here between ideology and false consciousness. Yet more needs to be said if its weight is to be assessed correctly. The first point to make is that the proposal, Engels’s only explicit reference to ‘false consciousness’, comes from a letter written some ten years after Marx’s death. Moreover, Engels himself has a sharp sense of the division between private correspondence and work intended for the public realm. A short time later he was to warn another correspondent: ‘Please do not weigh each word in the above too scrupulously… I regret that I have not the time to work out what I am writing to you so exactly as I should be obliged to do for publication’.[[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-11) The conception that was sketched in his private correspondence plays no part, it should be noted, in Engels’s own use of the concept of ideology in works written for publication, even in those of which he was the sole author.[["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-12) Moreover, his warning has in one sense been thoroughly heeded. For very little attention has been paid in the later literature to the particular shade of meaning he wished to attach to the notion of false consciousness. What he seems to have had in mind is a quite specific kind of cognitive failure on the part of an individual, a failure of self-awareness, a lack of insight into the ‘motive forces’ of their own thinking. What is generally in question later under the rubric of false consciousness is, as was suggested above, some form of collective illusion of much more general scope. Plainly this cannot claim even so much of the authority of Engels as would otherwise attach to the contents of the false consciousness letter.

It should be added that this letter is not the only source of guidance on the question of ideology that Engels has to offer after Marx’s direct influence on him was removed. In a text Engels did intend for publication, and indeed over which he might be assumed to have taken particular care, he speaks of ‘the great law of motion of history, the law according to which all historical struggles, whether they proceed in the political, religious, philosophical or some other ideological domain, are in fact only the more less clear expression of struggles of social classes’.[[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/joseph-mccarney/article.htm#foot-13) This may surely be taken as a version of the formulation of Marx’s ‘Preface’ that is helpfully more explicit in one important respect, its reference to ‘the struggles of social classes’, than the earlier work could afford to be in its own time. An attempt to develop a positive account of what ideology means to Marx and, a lone aberration apart, to Engels also, could hardly do better than to start here. To do so would be a more fitting tribute to Engels’s intellectual legacy than that represented by the pursuit of the spectre of false consciousness he so lightly conjured into existence.

### ‘The creatures,too,must become free’: Marx and the Animal/Human Distinction

The clarion call for the liberation of animals quoted in the title of this paper is cited approvingly by Marx in _On the Jewish Question_ (Marx, 1975: 172). The words themselves belong to Thomas Münzer, the leader of the German Peasants’ Revolt in the early sixteenth century, and what attracted Marx was Münzer’s view that under the dominion of private property and money, nature is treated in such a contemptuous way that it is debased. Münzer had conduded:

...all creatures have been turned into property, the fishes in the water, the birds in the air, the plants on the earth; the creatures, too, must become free.

As far as I know there is no further evidence to suggest that Marx was a champion of animal liberation, but his appreciation of Münzer’s position should at least lead us to expect from him a sympathetic view towards (non-human) animals. However, a number of prominent commentators, chief among them Ted Benton and Jon Elster (Benton, 1988 and 1993; Elster, 1985), claim that Marx completely lacked respect for animals, thinking of them as inferior beings. In this paper I will refute this position and argue that Marx has a respectful attitude towards animals and non-human nature in general. This is an intrinsic feature of his humanistic philosophy, which is grounded in defining the human essence by comparing humans with other animals. Shortly after endorsing Münzer’s sentiments Marx characterises his own brand of communism as the equation of humanism and naturalism (Marx, 1975: 296), but if Benton is correct in attributing a form of ‘species imperialism’ to Marx, it would seriously undermine his communist vision (Benton, 1993: 42).

I will argue that Marx’s discussion of the difference between humans and animals is entirely free of prejudice against animals and certainly does not treat them as inferior or deficient beings. Further, Marx’s brief discussions of animals, in particular his recognition of their specific needs and capabilities, indicates that his humanism seeks a harmony between humanity and nature, in which ‘nature’ comprises both human and non-human nature, as a number of commentators have appreciated (Grundmann, 1991; Vaillancourt, 1996; Wilde, 1998: ch.7). The primary political implication is that as the modern maltreatment of animals reflects the extent to which the capitalist accumulation process drives towards the disregard of all natural feelings, resistance to such maltreatment constitutes resistance to the mode of production. Animal welfare activism is, therefore, an antisystemic movement, albeit operating with a high degree of autonomy from anti systemic movements which are either explicitly socialist or else focused on other particular forms of oppression.

### Marx’s Essentialism

It is important to clarify just why Marx felt the need to raise the issue of the distinction between humans and animals in the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ and then return to it in his mature political economy. One of the aspects of alienation described in the _Manuscripts_ is alienation from species being (Marx, 1975: 275-7), a Feuerbachian term for human essence. Like Feuerbach’s discussion of what it is that makes us human (Feuerbach, 1986: 69-71), Marx’s argument is couched in terms of what distinguishes us from other animals. In fact the influence of Aristotle’s _De Anima_ is clear in the work of both Feuerbach (Wartofsky, 1977: 224, 374, 423) and Marx, who translated the text into German as early as 1840 (Meikle, 1985: 58). Whereas Aristotle focuses on ‘reason’ as the defining human quality, and Feuerbach emphasises ‘universality’, Marx argues for ‘conscious life activity’ (Marx, 1975: 276). We will look more closely at precisely what Marx means by this in the next section, but for now let us note that he shares with Aristotle the view that the human being is essentially a social being, a _zoon politikon_, and the human essence can be realised only in society (Aristotle, 1969: 5; Marx, 1986: 18). But the stress on activity introduces an emphasis on production which in turn brings in a developmental or historical dimension which is not to be found in Aristotle’s philosophy. Despite this important difference, both Aristotle and Marx should be regarded as essentialists (Meikle, 1985; Wilde, 1998, chs.2, 3; Pike, 1999). When they define the essence of the human species they are not simply making an empirical statement but also implying that this essence ought to be fulfilled.

In Marx’s case, he argues that it may be possible to define human uniqueness by such things as consciousness or religion or ‘anything else you like’, but humans really begin to distinguish themselves from other animals when they begin to produce their means of subsistence (Marx,1976a: 31). In other words focusing on consciousness or even language leaves us with the problem of understanding exactly what is going on when animals really think or communicate verbally, whereas the difference in our capacities to produce is tangible. In creating a world of objects humanity proves its species being, so that, in Marx’s view, the history of industry and the objective existence of industry constitute the ‘open book of _man’s essential powers_’ (Marx,1975: 302). Marx views human essence as _creative social activity_, something which is expressed throughout human history, but always in distorted ways insofar as the producers themselves are not experiencing work as their act of creation. Only in communist society would we see the ‘real appropriation of the human essence by and for man’ and the ‘true resolution of the strife between existence and essence’ (Marx, 1975: 296). Essentialism is roundly condemned in (post)modern social theory, usually on the grounds that it obstructs the recognition of difference and fails to grasp the rich pluralism of life (e.g. Young,1990: ch.8). But there is nothing in the view that all people should be able to realise their social creativity that stipulates any particular form which the free society should adopt.

I do not want to revisit the old arguments about whether the alienation theme persists in the writings of the mature Marx, or what parts of it may persist, but at this stage we should note that in his later writings Marx affirrns both the idea that there is a human essence, or human nature in general, and that humans can be distinguished from animals in the way they produce. It is absolutely clear in _Capital_ that there are two sorts of human nature, the ‘general’ and the ‘historically modified’. Lambasting Bentham’s utilitarianism, he argues that it is necessary to understand human nature in general (human essence) in order to judge what is good for humans, just as if we are to know what is good for dogs we need to study dog-nature (Marx, 1996: 605n). As for what constitutes quintessentially human production, the discussion in one of Marx’s final works, the marginal notes on Adolph Wagner’s _Lehrbuch der politischen Öconomie_, closely follows that of the 1844 _Manuscripts_, as Terrell Carver has pointed out (Carver, 1975; 167). It is also very similar to the discussion in part one of _The German Ideology_ (Marx, 1976a 44). The emphasis is again on the practical activities through which humans reveal their distinctiveness from other animals. Marx is impatient with Wagner’s formulation that the human ‘finds himself’ in relation to the outside world as a means of satisfying his needs. He objects that Wagner’s individualistic and idealistic conception of what it is to be human implies an ‘isolated juxtaposition with nature’ and pictures the human as a ‘non-gregarious animal’ (Marx, 1989: 538-9). They begin, ‘like every animal’, by satisfying their needs, but in constantly developing their needs in interaction with each other and with non-human nature they develop linguistic skills, naming goods because they are useful for themselves and thereby conferring utility on those goods.

We can gain further insight into Marx’s conceptualisation of the human-animal distinction in two separate and apparently ambivalent comments in _Capital_ on Benjamin Franklin’s definition of man as a tool-making animal. His first citation approvingly acknowledges Franklin’s insight that our ability to make and use tools is a distinctively human capacity, although Marx acknowledges that the germ of this ability can be found in some other species (Marx, 1996: 189). Later on, however, he mocks Franklin’s definition as being typical of ‘Yankeedom’ (Marx, 1996: 331n). What is going on here? In the first instance Marx agrees with Franklin that the use of tools is characteristic of purely human productiveness, but ultimately he finds something profoundly wrong with the conclusion that we are therefore to be regarded as tool-making animals. For Marx, it is not acceptable to reduce the difference between humans and animals to a technical proclivity, for this obscures the range of distinctively human needs which go with our difference. ‘Yankeedom’ signifies the most advanced and energetic form of capitalist endeavour which drives towards the commodification of everything and, in the process, denies the workers control over their lives. According to Franklin’s definition there is no necessary problem with this, as long as our animal needs are met. For Marx, it represents an alienation of the human essence and is incompatible with the realisation of human freedom. However, it does not follow from this, as Benton suggests, that distinctively human needs are superior to animal needs, or that animal needs within humans are profaned and regarded as shameful residual features (Benton: 1993: 43-4). Unfortunately such views have been common enough in the past but they are not shared by Marx, for whom the different types of needs are not antagonistic, just different. I hope to make this clearer by examining what Marx says about the human/animal distinction in the _Manuscripts_, _The German Ideology_, and the first volume of _Capital_.

### The Human-Animal Distinction in the _Manuscripts_

Let us take a closer look at what Marx says about the differences between humans and animals in the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ in the discussion of estranged labour towards the end of the first manuscript. He begins by stating that as a result of alienation the worker feels freely active only in ‘animal functions’ such as eating, drinking and procreating, while in his human functions ‘he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal’ (Marx, 1975: 275-6). He accepts that eating and drinking are genuinely human functions, but when they are separated from the sphere of all other human activity and turned into ‘sole and ultimate ends’, they are animal functions. So, humans share attributes with other animals, but to express their true humanity they must realise their human essence of social creativity. When their conditions of existence prevent them from doing so they experience a ‘loss of self’. Hence the prevailing discourse of the _Manuscripts_ is one of dehumanisation, implying that capitalist production denies them something which is their due as human beings (Marx, 1975: 137, 212, 284, 303, 308).

Animals in their natural state do not feel this loss of self because the animal is immediately ‘at one’ with its life activity. Marx argues that humans make life activity the object and will of their consciousness; ‘conscious life activity distinguishes man immediately from animal life activity’ (Marx, 1975: 276). He contrasts human production, in its widest sense, with the way in which animals produce:

But an animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, whilst man produces universally. It produces only under the dominion of immediate physical need, whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom. An animal produces only itself, whilst man reproduces the whole of nature. An animal’s product belongs immediately to its physical body, whilst man freely confronts his product. An animal forms objects only in accordance with the standard and the need of the species to which it belongs, whilst man knows how to produce in accordance with the standard of every species, and knows how to apply everywhere the inherent standard to the object. Man therefore also forms objects in accordance with the laws of beauty (Marx, 1975: 276).

The theme here is the uniqueness of human universality, the capacity to produce according to plan on a grand scale, over and above what is required by natural necessity and with the knowledge of how the other species produce. Later in the _Manuscripts_ he describes the specifically human natural being as a ‘being for himself,’ manifested by having a known history, ‘a conscious self-transcending act of origin’ (Marx, 1975: 337) Truly human production, then, transcends the instinctive response to immediate physical needs, and we are able to create things in accordance with the standards of other species and imbue our products with aesthetic qualities. The cave paintings of early _homo sapiens_ provide a good illustration of Marx’s conception, for they were created beyond the requirements for physical survival and they often depict the struggle for survival in our relationships with other animals.

Marx’s ruminations on the human/animal distinction seem to me to be entirely without disrespect to animals, and, furthermore, as Erich Fromm has concluded, they constitute perhaps the most significant definition of the species characteristic of the human being (Fromm, 1968: 58, _cf_.Fromm, 1992, ch.4). However, it seems that any attempt to establish human uniqueness is likely to provoke a hostile response from those who consider that inevitably it degrades animals. Benton, for example, attributes to Marx arguments referring to the ‘merely animal’ or ‘merely existing’ seven times within two paragraphs of _Natural Relations_ (Benton, 1993: 41), despite the fact that Marx does not use the word ‘mere’. Marx intends no slight against animals when defining human uniqueness, nor is it obvious that he operates from an underestimation of animal capabilities and needs. Indeed, as we shall see in the next section Marx does have a view on what constitutes natural needs for animals in general, but first we must deal with the objection that Marx’s emphasis on creative production does not work as a way of distinguishing humans from other animals.

Benton argues that Marx’s formulation ignores the wealth and complexity of social life in other species. It also, he claims, ignores the adaptability of many species in their relationships with the environment. Now it is clearly not Marx’s intention to write a disquisition on animal life, but his characterisations turn on the animals’ meeting of immediate physical needs and their unmediated relationship with their environment. These characterisations are not contradicted by any number of examples of co-operation and ingenuity displayed by many species as long as that activity remained directed towards the meeting of immediate needs. However, Marx’s characterisation of animals would indeed be refuted if Benton is correct in arguing that ‘inventing, making, using and inter-generational teaching of the use of tools are now well recognised as powers of non-human primates’ (Benton, 1993: 36-7). The research cited by Benton, conducted by Jane Goodall in Tanzania, refers to the use of stripped sticks to ‘fish’ termites from their mounds. This use of a stick as a tool is so rudimentary that it surely serves to confirm rather than rebut the fact that humans produce in radically different ways from other animals. Jon Elster falls into the same trap in seeking to minimise the differences in productive capacities between humans and other animals (Elster, 1985: 62-8). In both cases the rhetorical strategy is similar, citing a scientific source to blur the distinction in productive techniques without genuinely getting to grips with Marx’s argument. Do other animals fashion and use tools in the same way as humans? Do they make tools to make other tools? The answer to both questions is plainly ‘no’ and it seems to me that to argue otherwise does animals no favour.[[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/lawrence-wilde/article.htm#foot-1)

As animal intelligence expert Stephen Budiansky points out, attempts to show that animals can do some things almost like humans ignores the glaring discontinuities between humans and animals:

To play the game of trying to smash the pedestal of human uniqueness by showing that animals can, too (after a fashion), make tools, or create sentences or count, misses this fundamental point (Budiansky, 1999: 18).

To argue that animals use tools almost like humans encourages the view to which Benton rightly objects, that is, that animals are not properly human. Benton accepts that there is no evidence of generation-by-generation cumulative development of collective skills, but he claims this is a ‘purely contingent matter’; just because other animals have not shown this capability there is no _a priori_ reason why they might not at some stage in the future (Benton, 1993: 41). Similarly Elster concedes that there are no documented cases of animals making tools to make other tools, but suggests that ‘such cases might yet be found’ (Elster, 1985: 66). This is sheer sophism. Marx’s claim that there is a qualitative difference in the productive capacities of humans and other animals does not mean that there is no development whatsoever in animal capabilities, as this passage from _Capital_ makes clear:

The use and fabrication of instruments of labour, although existing in the germ among certain species of animals, is specifically characteristic of the human labour process (Marx, 1996: 188).

The fact that the ‘germ’ is present in other animals does not detract in the slightest from the force of Marx’s argument that, according to available empirical evidence, humans and other animals can be distinguished in essence by the way in which they produce. This carries no connotations of deficiency on the part of animals. Indeed his characterisation of the animal as immediately ‘one with its life activity’ suggests a simplicity and integrity which many humans might envy. It is possible to view any comparison of closely related forms in terms of inferiority or superiority, but it is not necessary to do so. If we compare a sparrow with an eagle and describe some of the differences in terms of size, speed, and physical power, this should not be taken to suggest that the sparrow is an inferior being. To identify a capability in humans by comparing them with animals does not imply a disability in animals; it states merely that they are different in essence. I think that is Marx’s position and that this is clearly demonstrated in the language he employs.

### Animal Needs

Although Marx argues that animals live under the dominion of immediate physical need, this carries no implication that their needs are not to be respected. In the third manuscript of the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ there is another reference to animals and their needs which is pertinent to the discussion. Marx launches into an indignant description of the way in which the satisfaction of those needs which we share with other animals is frequently denied to workers in capitalism.

The dwelling in the light, recognised by Prometheus as one of the greatest boons to humanity, is no longer available for the worker; ‘light, air etc.—the simplest animal cleanliness— ceases to be a need for man’ (Marx, 1975: 307-8). He then cites the plight of the Irish poor, forced to exist on a diet comprised exclusively of scabby potatoes, commenting that ‘it is not only that man has no human needs—even his animal needs cease to exist.’ He goes on to say that animals have at least the need to hunt, to roam, and to have companionship. The point of these remarks is to highlight the cruel insensitivity to human needs which capitalist production metes out to its workers, but there is a clear description of animal needs which have been systematically disregarded by twentieth century capitalist production methods—light, air, a varied diet, the freedom to roam and companionship. Marx is not simply concerned to emphasise the difference between humans and other animals but also to demonstrate the extent to which the needs they share are brutally disregarded even in a system devised by humans. The reference to hunting as a need for some animals also reminds us that the needs of different species are often incompatible.

In _The German Ideology_ Marx provides examples in which the development of modern production methods prevents animals from meeting their essential needs. He discusses the effects of the pollution of a river, using an essentialist language which owes much to his Aristotelian philosophical background:

The ‘essence’ of the freshwater fish is the water of a river. But the latter ceases to be the ‘essence’ of the fish and is no longer a suitable medium of existence as soon as the river is made to serve industry, as soon as it is polluted by dyes and other waste products and navigated by steamboats, or as soon as its water is diverted into canals where simple drainage can deprive the fish of its medium of existence (Marx, 1976a: 58).

The context of these remarks is important, for the point Marx is making is that Feuerbach’s abstract naturalism tends to identify the essence of things, including the human essence, without reference to their historical evolution and their social context. Feuerbach is accused of failing to grasp that essences can be understood only in relation to existence. It is only by recognising the historicity and universality of human activity that we can begin to understand and change the nature of things. He considers that Feuerbach’s philosophy views problems such as the plight of the freshwater fish as ‘inevitable abnormalities’ rather than problems which can be resolved through radical change. A little further on in the _German Ideology_ he argues that human needs are developed uniquely as part of a historical process, by which he means through the conscious creation of the means of production and exchange. He begins by saying that sheep and dogs are not historical in that way, but then says that in their present form, ‘in spite of themselves,’ they are products of a historical process (Marx, 1976a: 82). In other words the physical forms of these animals is altered by human intervention in their breeding. The object of these remarks is not to denounce human interference in nature _per se_, but to emphasise that what we term ‘nature’ is not pristine, that we are part of nature and have the unique ability to reconstruct our relationship with it. This refers to our relationship with our own nature as well as with non-human nature.

### Lost in Translation

So far we have looked only at Marx’s comments on the human animal relationship made relatively early in his life, but we can identify a continuity of theme in two passages from his mature political economy. In the first volume of _Capital_ Marx introduces his discussion of the labour process by arguing that although humans initially laboured instinctively like other animals, through social interaction with their environment they develop the exclusively human characteristic of conscious life activity whereby they are able to plan their work. I have argued that Marx’s formulations in the early writings do not impute a disability to animals when comparing their production to humans, but this reading is thrown in doubt when we read the popular Moore and Aveling translation of this part of _Capital_. They translate ‘_Wir haben es hier nicht mit den ersten tierartig instinktmassigen Formen derArbeitzu tun_’ (Marx, 1970: 192-3) as ‘We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal’ (Marx, 1996: 187). In fact Marx does not use the words ‘primitive’ or ‘mere’ and the speciesist connotations are entirely the product of the translators. The superior translation of Ben Fowkes has Marx talking about ‘those first instinctive forms of labour which remain on the animal level,’ but this reference to a lower animal level is not how Marx chose to express himself (Marx, 1976b: 283). The translation by Eden and Cedar Paul gives us ‘those primitive and instinctive forms of labour which we share with other animals,’ and despite the insertion of ‘primitive’ this at least captures Marx’s acknowledgment that there is much we share with other animals (Marx, 1957: 169). A more reliable translation suggested to me by Terrell Carver has Marx saying ‘We are not dealing here with the first forms of labour bounded by instincts as animals are’. Marx did not consider that the instinct-bound production of animals rendered them deficient, but the Moore and Aveling misreading of Marx is unfortunately all too common. It is diffficult for people who have known nothing other than the intensely competitive ethos of capitalist society to grasp that to establish a difference does not have to imply a deficiency on one side.

Indeed the different capacities of humans might well suggest that we are lacking some of the skills which develop in instinct bound production. Marx argues that the productions of spiders and bees put to shame the equivalent efforts of weavers and architects, but ‘what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality’ (Marx, 1996: 188). Marx selects the most intricate of animal productions to make his point, and in so doing reveals a respect for their endeavours and their nature. However, his concern in _Capital_ is to explain what happens to human beings in the capitalist mode of production. Specifically, his purpose in the chapter on the labour process is to show how money was transformed into capital through the extraction of surplus value in the process of exploitation. The controlling power in the labour process shifts from the producer to capital. The formally free individuals enter a contract which deprives the producers of the freedom to exercise the creative power which defines their humanity. In the chapter on cooperation Marx reverts to his earlier humanist discourse when he contrasts this alienated world with the image of a cooperative, planned society, in which the worker ‘strips off the fetters of his individuality, and develops the capabilities of his species’ (Marx, 1996: 334). This is very close to his 1844 articulation of communism as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for humanity.

Marx argues that the ineluctable contradictions inherent in capitalism provide the opportunity to construct a social system in which humanity is able to fulfil its creative potential.[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/lawrence-wilde/article.htm#foot-2) But of course Marx is no starry-eyed optimist. The sort of mastery of nature displayed in capitalism amounts to a tragic perversion of our species potential, as he laments in a speech given for the anniversary of the _People’s Paper_:

At the same pace that mankind masters nature, man seems to become enslaved to other men or to his own infamy... All our invention and progress seem to result in endowing material forces with intellectual life, and in stultifying human life into a material force (Marx, 1980: 655-6).

Clearly for Marx mastery of nature is not liberating until such time as we master our own nature and, in so doing, take sensitive and responsible control of the management of the interchange between human nature and non-human nature, including other animals. For Marx, humanity is always ‘part of nature’ (Marx, 1975: 276). In the third volume of _Capital_ he speaks of humanity achieving freedom within the realm of natural necessity, whereby the associated producers govern the interchange with nature in a rational way under conditions ‘most worthy and appropriate for their human nature’ (Marx, 1981: 959) What does he mean by this? We fulfil our nature when we realise our potential for social creativity, when we create a world in which life is sustained harmoniously. It is unimaginable that we could manage our interchange with nature in a truly humane way without actualising our sense of compassion, through which we empathise with the suffering of other species and in doing so manifest our own uniqueness.

### Political Implications

The tendency of advanced capitalism to stultify the lives of humans into nothing more than a material force has long been the fate of many species of animals. The logic of accumulation is indifferent to the feelings of the producers and the produced, and the inhumane treatment of animals in the production process bears this out. However, Marx did not simply reveal the logic of capitalist accumulation, he identified the contradictions within it and the social forces which could intervene in order to hasten its end. More often than not socialist resistance has been associated with direct confrontation with capital on economic issues or with the activities of socialist parties in the political sphere. Today, in addition to struggles of this sort, protest movements have developed on a range of issues conventionally termed non-class issues. However, it seems to me that the emergence of these issues and the mobilisation which has taken place as a result should be regarded as important phenomena from a socialist perspective. This is certainly true when it comes to the politics of animal protection.

The first set of issues raised is a particular form of the contradiction between the forces of production and the relations of production whereby the drive to accumulation actually destroys the very basis of production itself. Marx noted this in relation to soil exhaustion and was very interested in the scientific work in this area conducted by von Liebig and Fraas (Marx, 1996: 506-8; Marx, 1987: 558-9). With animal products it is not simply the animals who are killed but also some consumers. In the drive to minimise the cost of production unsafe feeding methods lead to disease breaking out on a wide scale, as in the recent examples of the salmonella and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The beef crisis in Britain was not exceptional, it was the all-too predictable outcome of a scramble for profits. It carries with it a survivalist deregulatory ideology of frightening irrationality, expressed by one farmer in a radio interview who asked ‘why should we have to put up with all these regulations when the French get away with feeding their animals on shit?’. The logic of accumulation determines that capitalist farmers will go to any lengths to cheapen their product and increase profitability. That these lengths include the violation of natural laws and the chronic disregard for the natural needs of animals has now become a public issue. What is exposed in this instance is the vacuity of the usual justification for ‘efficient’ production. In this case there is no shortage of meat in the developed world and there is a limit to how much of it people can be persuaded to buy, there is simply no need for this disgusting perversion of nature.

A range of groups have attacked the cruelty inherent in all instances of factory farming, in which the natural needs of animals as described by Marx and others are disregarded. These groups, which have expanded dramatically in size since the 1970s, have used a variety of methods, including legal and illegal direct action (Garner, 1993, chs. 2 and 8). Sometimes the issues are raised in campaigns which are specifically aimed at the insidious nature of corporate power, as when the McLibel campaign exposed the appalling suffering of battery chickens. The furious response of corporations and the state to these campaigns indicates the extent to which the economic and political elites recognise that what is being questioned here are the rights of the owners of the means of production.

The second set of issues is around cruelty to animals outside the horrors of factory farming induding blood sports and circuses (Garner, 1993: 170-4 and 83-4). The campaign to have fox hunting banned has attracted widespread publicity in recent years, and although this issue may seem ‘peripheral’ to some socialists, its greater significance lies in the challenge to the values which society is prepared to tolerate. Interestingly, on this issue of compassion the battle lines are drawn along old-fashioned class lines, despite the claims of the Countryside Alliance to be up holding the interests of poor rural workers. Again, the sentences meted out to hunt saboteurs reveal the class nature of the legal system, just as the pusillanimous backpedalling of the Labour Government shows the mysterious strength of a pro-hunting lobby with little popular support. Other instances of pastime cruelty such as animal circuses, shooting birds and other animals, and bull fights have elicited opposition in recent years. From an essentialist philosophical standpoint, not only do those taking part show no respect for the essence of the animals concerned, but in doing so they betray their own human essence by failing to recognise the cruelty of what they are involved with.

The third set of issues is to do with experiments on animals (Singer, 1990, ch.2). On the question of animal experimentation for potentially life-saving treatments for humans there is an assumption on the humanist side that this is justified. But there can be no justification for all those experiments on animals conducted for other purposes, such as cosmetics. The relationship between humans and animals could never be rendered entirely non-conflictual. Marx’s formulation of communism in the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ as ‘the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man’ (Marx, 1975: 296) perhaps promises too much. Herbert Marcuse pointed out that the myth of Orpheus, who tamed the wild beasts by the power of his music, is not a realisable goal when it comes to complex matters about our relations with nature. Nevertheless, operating within a Marxist humanist framework, Marcuse asserts that ‘no free society is imaginable which does not...make the concerted effort to reduce consistently the suffering which man imposes on the animal world’ (Marcuse, 1972: 68).

If resistance to cruelty to animals in the production process is regarded as a struggle against that production process, then in a strong sense the groups involved in those struggles are new antisystemic movements. However, like many of the ‘old’ antisystemic movements, those involved may not see the wider picture and may not be able to link with movements concerned with different forms of oppression such as racism, sexism, or economic exploitation. However, in states where the electoral system permits ‘New Left’ parties to participate in parliament, the politics of animal welfare occupies an important place—_Die Grunen_ in Germany are perhaps the best example. The development of these political forces, and their uneasy and uncertain links with older movements of the Left, is crucial to the development of a long, pluralistic movement for the democratic control of the regulation of all production, which will be a feature of the struggle of all humane forces against capital in the coming century. Marx’s conception of communist society was that of an ethical community operating democratically through free and equal individuals no longer under the tutelage of the law of value. To achieve the consciousness necessary to create this new world, Marx claimed that the alteration of humanity on a mass scale was required. When he talked of revolution it was an ethical as well as a social revolution, through which humanity rid itself of the ‘muck of all ages’ and became ‘fitted to found society anew’ (Marx, 1976a: 52-3). The realisation of our sense of compassion in our dealings with animals is a necessary part of that revolution.

### Notes

1. Benton admits that there are ‘profound differences’ in production techniques between humans and other species, but tries to reduce the force of this argument by saying that there are profound differences between different groups of humans (p. 37). As Marx is talking about essential difference between whole species Benton’s objection is jejune. There are profound differences.

2. Of course we have a potential to be destructive, and Benton complains that Marx ignores this potential for ‘evil’. But, as Erich Fromm argues, this potential must be regarded as a ‘secondary potentiality’ which develops when creativeness is thwarted (Fromm, 1991, 37-8—for a detailed analysis see Fromm, 1997).

### 1. LENIN AND HEGEL

1961 marked the beginning of the publication in English of a new edition of the Collected Works. Of the greatest thinker of this century, V. I. Lenin. These writings will prove absolutely invaluable in the process, now beginning, of developing Marxist theory to .answer the revolutionary tasks of the working class in this and every other country. Just as Lenin made his enormous original contribution to theory as part of the construction of a revolutionary leadership at the beginning of the century, so theoretical development today will be made only as part of the living struggle to overcome the betrayals and the theoretical degeneration of the Social-Democratic and Stalinist movements. Overcoming the consequences of those betrayals is not a question of words, but of building an alternative leadership which can arm the working class with the developing theory required to achieve consciousness of its historic role and the necessary strategy of class struggle.

In reading Lenin, therefore, our aim is not to find recipes for our present problems, but to gain an insight into the method used by this outstanding thinker and political leader. With the use of this method Lenin made important discoveries about the nature of world capitalism and about the social relations and ideologies of his own time, particularly in Russia. These discoveries have received more study than the method itself, and yet Lenin's use of the dialectical method was the key to his ability to analyse new stages in economic and political development, and to his mastery of political strategy and tactics. Future articles in _LABOUR REVIEW_ will take up some of Lenin's specific contributions in various fields. Here we are concerned primarily with his method of approach; all the volumes published so far could be used as illustrations of Lenin's method, but the publication of his _Philosophical Notebooks_ in English for the first time is a useful occasion for taking up the question more generally.

The Notebooks are not bedtime reading. Not one sentence in them was in any way prepared for publication. The text consists entirely of extracts taken by Lenin from various philosophical works and reviews, his underlinings in these extracts, and his own comments, usually very cryptic. Of most interest are the notes on Hegel's _Science of Logic_ and _Lectures on the History of Philosophy_. Anyone undertaking a systematic study of Lenin's Notebooks will have to have beside him Hegel's _Logic_; only in this way can one see the continuity between separate notes and extracts. Even without this, Marxist students will find many of Lenin's brief notes very stimulating and worth detailed study. But these notes and extracts are part of a single project, and are therefore best taken as a whole, read through and reworked several times by the student in the light of his own knowledge of Marxism and of Lenin's own writings and actions. Once he gets past Hegel's Preface and introduction, Lenin writes: 'I am in general trying to read Hegel materialistically . . .' It is clear from his notes that his intention was to prepare the basis for a materialist exposition of the dialectical method which in Hegel remains in mystical form. A study of these notes clarifies greatly what Marx and Engels meant when they said that in order to arrive at a scientific method they had only to '[stand Hegel on his head, or rather, on his feet](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm#003)'.

### LOGIC AND REALITY

Hegel insisted on a Logic which was not something separate from the reality which confronted man, a Logic which was identical with the richness and movement of all reality, a Logic which expressed the whole process of man's growing consciousness of reality, and not just a dry summary of formal principles of argument, reflecting only one brief phase in the definition of reality by thinking men. Lenin notes: -:

[What Hegel demands is a Logic the forms of which would be forms with content, forms of living, real content, inseparably connected with the content.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_92aa)

[Logic is the science not of external forms of thought, but of the laws of development "of all material, natural and spiritual things". i.e., of the development of the entire concrete content of the world and of its cognition i.e. the sum-total, the conclusion of the history of knowledge of the world.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_92b)

Lenin's aim in 'reading Hegel materialistically' was to sift out the rational kernel of this Logic from the idealism in which it was constricted, for Hegel believed that only the 'Absolute Idea' had reality, expressing its necessary development in nature and history. When the highest product of this natural and historical evolution, critical philosophy, grasped consciously the truth of this process, then freedom replaced necessity. When Lenin 'rewrites' passages of the _Logic_, the relationship is inverted, without losing any of the brilliance and wealth of Hegel's insight. Our concepts are the reflection, worked out in the history of logic and philosophy, of the objective world of nature grasped by social man in his practical struggle to survive and develop. The 'leap from necessity to 'freedom' is then not a matter of philosophy, not a mental act, but a practical transformation of society and nature by men who have achieved consciousness of the social necessity of revolution.

Lenin lays great stress on Hegel's insistence that Dialectics is not a. master-key; a sort of set of magic numbers by which all secrets will be revealed. It is wrong to think of dialectical logic as something that is complete in itself and then 'applied' to particular examples. It is not a model of interpretation to be learned, then fitted on to reality from the outside; the task is rather to uncover the law of development of the reality itself.

[Logic is usually understood as being the "science of thinking", the "bare form of cognition.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_95)

[Dialectics has often been considered an **art**, as though it rested upon a subjective **talent** and did not belong to the objectivity of the Notion ...](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_223_2)

So long as this is the approach then we do not get beyond the limits of formal logic, considered by Hegel to be dead and fixed, rigidly insisting on the separateness of the aspects of phenomena instead of on their transitions into one another. Hegel says logic must be 'not abstract, dead and immobile, but concrete ...' and Lenin: '[This is characteristic! The spirit and essence of dialectics!](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_100)'. Consequently it is absolutely against the spirit of dialectics to artificially impose the 'triad' of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis on whatever process one chooses to abstract. Hegel is most explicit:

[That this unity, as well as the whole form of the method, is a **triplicity** is wholly, however, the merely superficial and external side of the manner of cognition.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_230)

He goes on to say that this 'triad ',

[. . has been rendered tedious and of ill-repute by the shallow misuse and the barrenness of modern so-called philosophic construction, which consists simply in attaching the formal framework without concept and immanent. determination to all sorts of matter and employing it for external arrangement.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_230a)

It is the logic of processes themselves- that must be exposed. Hegel says that dialectics has often been derided as an idle play with clever concepts, whose only aim is to sceptically demonstrate the difficulties and inconsistencies o£ 'common sense'.

[Dialectic is generally regarded as an external and negative procedure, that does not belong to the subject matter itself, that is based on pure vanity, as a subjective craving to shake and break down what is fixed and true, or that leads to nothing but the inaneness of the dialectically treated matter.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_97b)

When Hegel here asks for method that 'belongs the subject matter itself, he is not suggesting that only a description of what appears to the observer at first sight is required. Such descriptions are always couched in definite forms of thought, and are not 'pure descriptions'. It is possible to record the external characteristics of phenomena, then to arrive at judgements 'based' on these observations which in fact are an imposition _on_ the facts of some unexpressed assumption or theory. Dialectics attempts to probe to the essential self-movement of the phenomenon itself; the relations between its different aspects can then be shown as parts of a unified process, not just as separate determinations whose only interrelation is one imposed by the demands of consistency in thought. Hegel says:

[The absolute method (i.e., the method of cognition of objective truth, says Lenin) does not behave like external reflection but takes the determinate element from its own subject matter, since it is itself that subject matter's immanent principle and soul. This is what Plato demanded of cognition, that it should consider things in and for themselves, that is, should consider them partly in their universality, but also that it should not stray away from them catching at circumstances, examples and comparisons, but should keep before it solely the things themselves and bring before consciousness what is immanent in them.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_220aa)

This 'catching at externals, examples and comparisons' and 'generalising' from them often parades as scientific method, particularly in the study of society and politics. Instead of the law of development of things being discovered, we get instead a neat of 'consistent' arrangement of abstracted characteristics of similar phenomena. Lenin remarks on the sharpness of Hegel's criticism of this method, extracting, for example, his verdict on

[That procedure of knowledge reflecting on experience, which first perceives determinations in the phenomenon, next makes them the basis, and assumes for their so-called explanation corresponding fundamental materials or forces which are supposed to produce these determinations of the phenomenon . . .](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch01.htm#LCW38_115)

What is advanced as an explanation of a thing turns out to be only

[Determination deduced from that for which they are meant to be the grounds hypotheses and figments derived by an uncritical reflection.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm#LCW38_145)

Hegel's dialectical method is often condemned as an accommodation to the _status quo_, with its insistence on the 'identity of thought and the object'. But if the dialectic is properly understood it does not lead to any such conclusion. The following quotations explain clearly the _dynamic_ and _critical_ nature of dialectical knowledge, and incidentally illustrate well the process by which Lenin worked at the materialist reworking of Hegel's _Logic_:

[The _identity_ of the Idea with itself is one with the _process_; the thought which liberates actuality from the illusory show of purposeless mutability and transfigures it into the Idea must not represent this truth of actuality as a dead repose, as a mere _picture_, lifeless, without impulse or movement, as a genius or number, or an abstract thought; by virtue of the freedom which the Notion attains in the Idea, the Idea possesses within itself also the _most stubborn opposition_; its repose consists in the security and certainty with which it eternally creates and eternally overcomes that opposition, in it meeting with _itself_.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_194c)

Lenin, reading Hegel materialistically, substitutes:

[The coincidence of thought with the object](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_194c) is a **process**: thought (= man) must not imagine truth in the form of dead repose, in the form of a bare picture (image), pale (matt), without impulse, without motion, like a genus, like a number, like abstract thought.

The idea contains also the strongest contradiction, repose (for man's thought) consists in the firmness and certainty with which he eternally creates (this contradiction between thought and object) and eternally overcomes it...

Finally, Lenin rewrites the passage:

[Cognition is the eternal, endless approximation of thought to the object. The _reflection_ of nature in man's thought must be understood not "lifelessly", not "abstractly", _not devoid of movement, **not without contradictions**_, but in the eternal _**process**_ of movement, the arising of contradictions and their solution.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_195)

### LENIN BEFORE AND AFTER 1914

It is customary in some circles to claim that only when Lenin read Hegel in 1914-l5 did he grasp the dialectic; indeed it is fashionable to take this as proven. In his early writings Lenin is said to have been crude and mechanical; this crudeness is supposed to have been most explicit in his _Materialism and Empiriocriticism_ (1908), but the implication is that his attitudes on Party organisation and political questions were rigid and dogmatic. It is important to see that this case is sustained on a very narrow base: instead of an examination of the actual work of Lenin, including _Materialism and Empiriocriticism,_. we are usually presented with truncated extracts from the latter work, which distort its meaning, or with a series of short quotations from the Notebooks which are supposed to show that Lenin renounced his philosophical past. Raya Dunayevskaya goes so far as to say: 'It is under the section on " Syllogism", where Hegel destroys the opposition between subjectivity and objectivity that Lenin bursts forth with the aphorisms that reveal now decisive was his _break with his own philosophical past_.' (_Marxism and Freedom_, 1958, my emphasis, C.S.)

In this passage the reference is to Lenin's remarks On pp. 179 and 180 of the present edition, primarily the following:

[Marxists criticised (at the beginning of the twentieth century) the Kantians and Humists more in the manner of Feuerbach (and Buchner) than of Hegel.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_179)

and

[It is impossible completely to understand Marx's _Capital_, and especially its first Chapter, without having thoroughly studied and understood the _whole_ of Hegel's _Logic_. Consequently, half a century later none of the Marxists understood Marx!!](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_179)

There is no examination of Lenin's earlier works, only speculation that these passages imply a condemnation of Lenin's past philosophical assumptions, i.e., that he includes himself among the 'Marxists who did not understand Marx'. Now while there is no doubt that his reading of Hegel at the beginning of the First World War enriched Lenin's theory, enabled him to penetrate more deeply to the essence of the contradictions of imperialism and of the working-class movement, it is quite wrong to make the rigid demarcation which is now so often made between the. 'pre-Hegelian' and 'post-Hegelian' phases of his political life. Rather there is a really dialectical development in Lenin's own work. 1914 and his work towards the 19l7 Revolution and the construction of a new Communist International mark a new stage in the history of the movement, the stage when Lenin and his followers brought into the consciousness of a section of the working-class vanguard the reality of the new stage of Imperialism and the tasks with which it confronted the working class. Lenin's study of Hegel is part of this advance, a necessary part of the process by which consciousness was advanced. Like every other advance in Marxism, it could only come from a man immersed in the intensive theory and practice of the living movement of society and politics for many years.

If Dunayevskaya had only looked at Lenin's whole work with the same method which he outlines in Philosophical Notebooks; instead of formally comparing striking phrases in it with parts abstracted from other works written in different circumstances and with deliberately different emphases, then her work might have had some value to Marxism; but in fact she remains bogged down in the very formal method of which she accuses the early Lenin. Lenin could well have been pointing to bis own case when be quoted so admiringly the comparison made by Hegel. Lenin writes,

[Logic resembles grammar](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_98b), being one thing for the beginner and another thing for one who knows the language (and languages) and the spirit of language. It is one thing to him who approaches logic and the sciences in general for the first time and another thing for him who comes back from the sciences to Logic.

Then logic gives "the essential character of this wealth'; (the wealth of the world view), "the inner nature of spirit and of the world ...

Lenin is an experienced and accomplished revolutionary returning to Hegelian logic as logic; he brings to the task all the experience of 20 years' struggle in the construction of a revolutionary party against tendencies reflecting the complex forces of Russian society, struggle accompanied always by a profound study of social reality and all the schools of thought expressing the interests of the classes in that reality. Thus his 'reading' of Hegel is full and rich, able to appreciate - and expose the manysidedness and depth of the dialectical method formally presented by Hegel. This new appreciation of the richness of the dialectical concept of knowledge was an important part of his insistence on theory and principle, on understanding the tasks of the working class and its leadership in those years when, as he himself put it, the thinking of some Marxists was 'depressed and oppressed ' by the war to such a degree that they departed from the interests of the class they set out to represent, advocating instead theories which tied the proletariat to the ruling class in war.

The use of _Philosophical Notebooks_ to discredit Lenin's earlier work is a cover for a trend towards idealism in some critics. It becomes important to condemn Lenin's exposition of the idea that knowledge is the reflection of objective reality, and implicitly or explicitly to condemn his concept of a 'party of new type' as a necessity for the socialist revolution. It is therefore necessary to dispose of claims such as Dunayevskaya's that

'The keynote of his _Philosophical Notebooks_ is nothing short of a restoration of truth to philosophic idealism against vulgar materialism to which he had given the green light with his work on _Materialism and Empiriocriticism_.'

Dunayevskaya naturally quotes Lenin's aphorism: 'Intelligent idealism is closer to intelligent materialism than stupid materialism' (He rewrote this to read: 'Dialectical idealism is closer to intelligent [dialectical] materialism than metaphysical, undeveloped, dead, crude, rigid materialism.' LCW38_277.) But it is nonsense to suggest that Lenin revised his opinions on the general relationship between materialism and idealism. On page 293 of the _Notebooks_, he writes, after the notes on _Logic_, after the quotation so beloved of the idealists, the following:

Hegel completely **concealed** (NB) the **main thing**: (NB) the existence of things outside the consciousness of man and independent of it'. (LCW38_293)

It was to hammer home precisely that this was 'the main thing' that _Materialism and Empiriocriticism_ was written, in answer to a group of 'Godseekers' in the Russian Party, in 1908. In his notes on Hegel, Lenin's concern is, rather, explicitly to sift out the rational kernel of the method of this greatest idealist, and to show that consistent 'objective idealism' takes philosophy to the very eve of historical materialism. But only to the eve; Dunayevskaya does not quote any of Lenin's spirited sallies at Hegel's failure to leave idealism behind, even though they are liberally scattered through the _Notebooks_. A small sample will suffice:

The mystic - idealist - spiritualist Hegel (like all official, clerical-idealist philosophy of our day) extols and expatiates on mysticism, idealism in the history of philosophy, while ignoring and slighting materialism. Cf. Hegel on Democritus-nil!! On Plato a huge mass of mystical slush.' (pp. 281-2)

And a mass of thin porridge ladled out about God . . . (LCW38_303)

Here in Hegel is often to be found about God, religion, morality in general extremely trite idealistic nonsense.' (LCW38_309)

And in many places Lenin takes Hegel to task for

. . . concealing the weaknesses of idealism' (LCW38_289), 'a sophistical dodge from materialism' (LCW38_289), 'a cowardly evasion of materialism' (LCW38_258), and 'he pities God!! the idealistic scoundrel ! ! ' (LCW38_295)

That this condemnation of idealism does not stop Lenin from taking the very most from Hegel's logic is a tribute to his great intellectual acuteness combined with an unrelenting partisanship. It is quite foreign to the spirit of his work to quote him selectively in order to convey the impression that he ' broke with his philosophical past'. He did nothing of the kind, and _Materialism and Empiriocriticism_ will retain its significance as a brilliant statement of the materialist foundations of Marxism against pseudo-scientific 'realism'. The presentation of similar problems in the _Notebooks_ is a refinement but by no stretch of the imagination a rejection of the work of 1908.

### THE ROLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

If we examine even the earliest works of Lenin on social and political questions, it is difficult to see any justification for the view of Dunayevskaya that before 1914 Lenin did not really grasp the concept of unity of opposites, that he saw the opposite sides of phenomena simply coexisting alongside each other rather than interpenetrating and determining each other. She has to admit that in his political practice Lenin showed a grasp of dialectics, but this appears to have been 'unconscious', while in his thoughts Lenin remained rigid and mechanical. Quite apart from the comic aspect of this division, it can be shown that Lenin's writings are thoroughly imbued with the dialectical method, studying processes in their totality and in their development, with a bitter struggle against those who, like the Narodniks, abstracted separate features of society and appraised them with some set of abstract norms. Any number of quotations from _What The Friends of the People Are_ or _The Economic Content of Narodism_ would illustrate Lenin's grasp, already in 1896, of 'the unity of opposites'. A summary of Lenin's _method_ against the Narodnik sociologists will perhaps be useful. These Narodniks sought to defend small peasant property, particularly as part of the Russian-village commune. In order to do this they made. a study of the condition of this section of producers, their holdings, the impact on them of other classes and of government policy, etc., and they often gave harrowing accounts of the effect of commerce in driving the independent peasant to misery.

Lenin pointed out that a study. of land ownership alone, and even a burning and partisan account of the misery of the peasants, were no substitute for beginning with an analysis of the whole economic structure which determined the dominant trends and relationships in Russian society. The sector of that society which the Narodniks chose to defend by exposing its misery was not an alternative to the actually developing economic conditions, except in their minds. Only by seeing small peasant ownership as one 'moment' in the development of the structure of the very conditions they deplored could they ever understand it, i.e., bring their theoretical concepts into line with the actual economic development. Clearly this is only an example of the principle expounded by Lenin (and Hegel) in the quotations at the beginning of this article. So long as the Narodnik sociologists remained at the level of abstract criticism of the ruin of small peasant farming, then they in fact supported the dominant classes in the _status quo_. How could Lenin call their criticism of existing conditions abstract when the works they produced were packed with data about conditions of peasant life? Because 'small peasant farming' was _abstracted_ from its actually developing context in the economic structure, a context in which it is _necessarily_ tied to all those aspects which the Narodniks _abstracted_ and called 'negative'. The result of this mistaken method was political impotence. Narodism rejected the basic fact of conflict between labour and capital, but 'through the prism - of the living conditions and interests of the small producer, and therefore did so in a distorted and cowardly way, creating a theory which did not give prominence to the antagonism of social interests, but to sterile hopes in a different path of development'.

But Lenin took up the cudgels against some of the so-called Marxists like Struve, as well as against the Narodniks. It is worth dwelling on his criticism of Struve's 'objectivism', as it leads us to a vital point, the role of human consciousness and the relation between theory and practice. Lenin's consistent attack on 'objectivism' in the early writing gives the lie to those critics who claim that he neglected human agency in his pre-l914 theory. Although Struve correctly criticised the Narodniks for their defence of backwardness, he ended up by becoming an apologist for the advance of capitalism, rather than a Marxist able to analyse its contradictions. Lenin attacked him for seeing technical progress 'on the one hand ' as progressive, and bondage 'on the other hand ' as regressive, a brake on technical progress.

These two are phases of the same development of capitalism:

His bondage which he has now demolished as retrogressive is nothing but the initial manifestation of capitalism in agriculture, of that very same capitalism which leads later to sweeping technical progress, etc.

What is lacking in Struve is the standpoint of a given class in the basic class contradiction of society:

The main feature is . . . narrow objectivism which is confined to proving the inevitability and necessity of the process and makes no effort to reveal at each specific stage of this process the form of class contradiction inherent in it an objectivism that describes the process in general, and not each of the antagonistic classes whose conflict make up the process.

. . . though he correctly indicates the existence of a process, he does not examine what classes arose while it was going on, what classes were the vehicles of the process, overshadowing other strata of the population subordinate to them; in a word, the author's objectivism does not rise to the level of materialism . . .

This objectivism leads Struve to pose problems in a non-class way that is not without parallel in political thinking today. For example, he asks, 'In what way, on what basis, can our national economy be reorganised?' and Lenin replies,

"Our national economy" is a capitalist economy, the organisation and reorganisation of which is determined by the bourgeoisie, who "manage" this economy. Instead of the question of possible re-organisation, what should have been put is the question of the successive stages of the development of this bourgeois economy . . .

Lenin, in other words, demands an approach which sees all the 'aspects' of the process as necessarily interconnected parts of the whole, developing in necessary opposition; further, the analysis offered must be seen as part of the consciousness of the representatives of the social classes opposed to one another in the developing process, with the characteristic distortions of each class, only the point of view of the working class being able to sustain a scientific view of the unity and general development of the whole system. Here are the very real bases of Lenin's whole theoretical and practical approach in politics, bases upon which he built prodigiously for 25 years.

The 1905 Revolution was a forcing-house for the political development of Russian Socialist thinking, as well as a decisive step forward in the experience of the working class itself. Lenin showed in his writings of that period that he did not have to wait until l914 to be able to pose very clearly the difference between dialectical and 'vulgar' materialism in the prominence given to conscious action. In his _Two Tactics of Social Democracy_, Lenin condemns that method which offers

. . . a general description of the process (and) does not say a word about the concrete tasks of **our** activity. The new Iskra-ist method of exposition reminds one of Marx's reference (in his famous _Theses on Feuerbach_) to the old materialism which was alien to the ideas of dialectics.... They degrade the materialist conception of history by ignoring the active, leading and guiding part in history which can and must be played by parties which understand the material prerequisites of a revolution and have placed themselves at the head of the advanced classes.

All this reads very strangely beside Lunayevskaya's suggestion that only in 1914 did Lenin consciously understand the role of consciousness and the role of the masses in history. Lenin had already written in exile in 1897 a very direct characterisation of the connection between the Narodniks' lack of scientific method and their relation to the action of the masses. This quotation rounds off this section of the argument:

. . . their lack of sociologlcal realism impels them to a specific manner of thinking and reasoning about social affairs and problems which might be called narrow self-conceit or, perhaps, the **bureaucratic mentality**. The Narodnik is always dilating on the path "we" should choose for our country, the misfortune that would arise if "we" directed the country along such-and-such a path, the prospects "we" could ensure ourselves if we avoided the dangers of the path old Europe has taken, if we "take what is good" both from Europe and from old ancient village community system, and so on and so forth. Hence the Narodnik's complete distrust and contempt for the independent trends of **the social classes which are shaping history in accordance with their own interests ... As man's history-making activity** grows broader and deeper, the size of that mass of the population which is **the conscious maker of history** is bound to increase. The Narodnik however, always regarded the population in general, and the working population in particular, as the **object** of this or that more or less sensible measure, as something to be directed along this or that path and never regarded the various classes of the population as independent **history-makers** on the existing path, never asked which conditions of the present path might **stimulate (or, on the contrary, paralyse) the independent and conscious activity of these history-makers**. (my emphasis, C.S)

### THEORY AND PRACTICE

It is only on the basis of 'seeing the existence of objective reality independent of human consciousness as 'the main thing' that Lenin is able to make the great contribution on reflection and cognition as an active _process_, not as a dead mirroring, which he does in the _Notebooks_. Only a materialist understanding of the active role of human practice in the real world could form the basis for the richness of Lenin's conceptions, for it is from that real world that the infinitely expanding and enriched truth of human understanding is derived. If Lenin had written a book on dialectics based on the _Notebooks_, it would have been a presentation of the lines of growth of this human knowledge, the process by which man has continuously developed new processes of learning about the real world through his practice and through the development of thought. Every aspect of the development of techniques, of philosophy and social science, must be viewed as part of this process by which man's concepts become more and more 'filled with content'. This implies that every aspect of the history of thought and philosophy is viewed not abstractly, negatively from the point of view of the number of right and wrong elements contained in it, but in its own concrete development, and as part of the whole of human progress. Secondly, it implies the complete denial of dogmatism in theory. There is not a fixed truth, a secret of the world to be one day finally discovered, and our 'true' concepts about the reality we know are only true insofar as they express the changing character of the reality concerned, together with the change and flexibility of our own concepts, whose limitations are revealed by every experience and advance in thought. Lenin heavily underscores the following passage:

[Hence, Hegel says, the expression "unity" of thinking and being, of finite and infinite, etc., is _false_, because it expresses "quietly persisting identity". It is not true that the finite simply neutralises the infinite and _vice versa_. Actually, we have a _process._](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_200)

Hegel insists that thought must not imagine, once it gets beyond appearance to essence, that it has done its work. On the contrary, the discovery of truth is an infinite process, and the concepts which reflect it are the developing modes of a deeper and deeper penetration of that reality. Lenin says briefly: 'The coincidence of thought with the object is a process.' Man does not arrive at the truth, at 'repose' in his relation to truth, by simply reaching conclusions about it. Man's thought is relaxed. developing freely, in 'repose', only through the denial of repose, only through 'the firmness with which he eternally creates the contradiction between thought and object and eternally overcomes it'. This view of the relation between concepts and reality is brilliantly formulated, and to grasp this relation is the essence of Marxist politics as of any other science. Let us take as an example the problem which often arises in the day-to-day work of Marxist organisation, So long as the 'truth' about politics is thought to consist of some fixed secret of Marxist doctrine, some set of recipes, then reality proves very intractable indeed, constantly facing the revolutionary with frustrations, 'disappointments' and 'disillusionments'. Methods of work become inconsistent and moody, in a word, subjectivist. But if there is constant and conscious effort to probe and learn from reality, from the living movement, and on the deeper and deeper theoretical understanding flowing from this to base the Party's activity and organisation, a thirsting for enrichment by penetration of living reality, then the result is different. Although this _looks_ more 'difficult', less 'sure' constantly re-examining its own assumptions, yet it gives rise to steadiest, more relaxed methods of work, real 'repose' resting on strength, by virtue of the security and certainty and determination with which the learning, penetrating, questing process is organised, in order to fill our concepts with objective content. This is the process of creating and overcoming the contradiction between our ideas and objective reality.

[The _reflection_ of nature in man's thought must be understood not "lifelessly", not "abstractly", _not devoid of movement, **not without contradictions**_, but in the eternal _**process**_ of movement, the arising of contradictions and their solution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch03.htm#LCW38_195)

The implications of this view of cognition, of the process by which men have gained and will continue to gain knowledge of the truth, for a Marxist view of the history of philosophy, are pointed out by Lenin in some very stimulating short passages, particularly in the fragment, [_On the Question of Dialectics_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm#LCW38_359), which has appeared previously in English, but will be much more meaningful now that it can be compared with the earlier notes which prepare for it.

Lenin very specifically says that the self-movement of things through the struggle of opposites is the science of dialectics. This is the logical consequence of the understanding that dialectics is the selfmovement of reality, and of the concepts reflecting reality, and not an external logic which imposed its own distinctions and comparisons on reality. Dialectics is the theory of how reality _sorts itself out_, with growing human knowledge seen as the latest development of this reality, rather than a way of _sorting out_ reality. Hegel is quoted by Lenin to this effect:

[Thinking reason, however, sharpens, so to say, the blunt difference of diverse terms, the mere manifoldness of pictorial thinking, into_essential_ difference, into _opposition_. Only when the manifold terms have been driven to the point of contradiction to they become active and lively towards one another, receiving in contradiction the negativity which is the indwelling pulsation of self-movement and spontaneous activity](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm#LCW38_142)

It is not necessary to mention here the occasions on which Lenin applied this approach to political questions in such a way that he was constantly condemned for doctrinairism and factionalism. Right through the history of Russian Social Democracy he fought bitterly its petty-bourgeois and intellectual wing, expressing itself first through Struve and the 'legal Marxists', then in Plekhanov's subjectivism and 'circle' spirit and the Menshevik objection to proletarian conceptions of organisation, in the ultra-left ideas which sprang up during the years of reaction, through to the struggle against liquidationism and the weakness of those who 'conciliated ' the reformists rather than fight to establish the independence of the working class against them. As Trotsky later acknowledged, he and others took for pettiness and crudeness what in fact amounted in Lenin to political necessity, based upon a method of proceeding from the basic contradictions facing the movement. Again, later articles will take up some of these important points.

It is vital to see the unity between Lenin's political career and his dialectical method. To his iron insistence on principle, even at the expense of personal and organisational difficulties which horrified those with more impressionistic methods, Lenin carried into practice the idea that the working class must decide its own fate, must place the achievement of its political independence through a revolutionary party before all partial considerations. Political and theoretical vacillations, subjective reactions to difficulties and to discipline, these were not separate or partial questions; they had to be analysed and decisively dealt with from the point of view of building a movement in the concrete conditions of Russia Lenin's study of Hegel in 1914-15 helped to heighten his awareness of the universality and depth of this method and so equipped him for the even greater task of reorienting the socialist movement of whole world This could not be done on an empirical basis alone. The facts studied for Lenin's _Imperialism_ and his work on the Second International and the Russian Revolution were selected and had meaning only in the framework of the dialectical method roughly drafted in the _Notebooks_, with its stress on the interconnection of all . aspects of phenomena, the identity of opposites, the need to go deeper and deeper into the practice of men in changing Nature and themselves. A return to the study of Lenin's practice and method today is an essential part of the solution of our revolutionary tasks.

# Dialectics

### The Logic of Marxism, and its Critics—An Essay in Exploration

---

### Prologue

THIS essay is an attempt to clear the ground for a better and fuller appreciation of that which gives Marxism its living unity—namely, the Dialectical Materialist _Method_. Its special feature is that it seeks to show what this method is by means of an examination of what it _did_ in the hands of Marx and Engels. It considers the Dialectical Materialist Method _in action_ in the theoretical practice of these its first elaborators, and following them (so far as falls within its purpose) that of their disciples, Lenin and Stalin.

No pretence is made that this essay is in any way final or authoritative. Very much to the contrary: it is in every respect an _essay_, a venture—an attempt at a provisional exploration of a field which no British Marxist has hitherto attempted on anything but a most perfunctory scale. It is therefore liable to all the faults and mischances necessarily attending such provisional essays. None the less it _is_—_an attempt!_ If its demerits—whatever they may be—provoke ethers better qualified to cover the ground in a more worthy manner it will have more than served its purpose.

#####   *  *  *  *  *  

This essay has been rendered necessary by two things. The first is the appalling state of Marxist studies in English, as evidenced by the quality of all but a very few of the works purporting to treat of Marx and Marxism which have appeared in Britain in recent years; the second is the fact of the existence of a cleavage in the Marxist camp represented by the conflict—carried at times to the pitch of actual combat in arms—between the Communists on the one side and the Social-Democrats and their allies upon the other.

No Marxist can view this conflict without concern: no Marxist who takes his Marxism seriously can treat it as a mere _personal_ squabble, arising from “faults on both sides,” which could be composed by the exercise of tact and patience. What is at stake in this conflict is the basic significance of Marxism itself, and upon such an issue no Marxist can do other than choose his side and help to fight the issue, theoretical and practical, to a finish. Full frankness is far more likely to produce union and agreement than any “diplomacy.”

As long ago as April, 1920, Stalin spoke of this cleavage in Marxism in these words:

“There are two groups of Marxists. Both are working under the flag of Marxism and consider themselves genuine Marxists. Nevertheless they are far from being identical. More than that. A complete gulf divides them, for their respective methods of work are diametrically opposed to each other.

“The first group usually confines itself to the superficial recognition of Marxism—to solemnly proclaiming it. Unable or not willing to study _the essence_ of Marxism, unable or not willing to apply it in practical life, it transforms the living revolutionary propositions of Marxism into dead, meaningless formulas. It bases its activities, not on experience, not on the results of practical work, but on quotations from Marx. It takes its guiding lines and directives not from an analysis of living reality, but from analogies and historical parallels. Discrepancy between word and deed—such is the principal disease from which this group suffers. . . . The name of this group is, in Russia, Menshevism; in Europe, Opportunism.

“The second group, on the other hand, transfers the centre of gravity of the question from the superficial recognition of Marxism to its realisation, to its application in practical life. Indicating the path and means of realising Marxism for various situations, changing the path and means when the situation changes—this is what this group concentrates on mainly. It takes its directives and its guiding lines not from historical analogies and parallels, but from the study of surrounding conditions. In its activities it relies not on quotations and aphorisms, but on practical experiences, testing every step it takes by experience, learning from its mistakes and teaching others to build a new life. This . . . explains why in the activities of this group there are no discrepancies between word and deed, and why the teachings of Marx fully preserve their living, revolutionary force.... The name of this group is Bolshevism—Communism.”—STALIN: _Lenin_, pp. 5-6.

Disregarding as irrelevant the objection that might be urged that Stalin, being a partisan in the dispute, is no more than any man “a judge in his own cause,” we affirm that the issue is ultimately as Stalin here states it.

“Marxism” is either a mere abstract opinion, having only an incidental connection with the practical realities of life and struggle—in which case there is no need for a “Marxist” to feel responsible for squaring his theory with his practice—or, alternatively, the Marxist world-conception is primarily a _theory of action_, one derived so intimately from the facts of life and struggle that he who declares himself a Marxist thereby takes upon himself the responsibility for liming Marxism as well as preaching it.

#####   *  *  *  *  *  

But before Marxism can be lived it must be _understood_ before it can be wielded as a weapon it must be _grasped_. And in order that a grasp of the essential logic of Marxism may become widespread in Britain it is before all things necessary to clear away the whole fabric of misconceptions and misrepresentations which stand as a blanket-veil between the ordinary British worker and Marxist understanding.

Although there have been “Marxists” of sorts in Britain since before the death of Marx, the working-class movement in Britain has never been consciously or purposefully Marxist. At best it has been _adulterated_ by such “Marxism” as has been available, and this, the native-British “Marxism,” has in turn, “like the dyer’s hand,” been “subdued to that it works in.”

Nothing evidences this better than the quality of the literature produced by native British Marxists. Apart from a score of works, all of recent date, in which an attempt is made to elucidate current problems by the aid of Marxist theory, this native British Marxist literature consists almost wholly of works purporting to “explain” Marxist theory in the _abstract_, in terms suited to the (presumably _infantile_) understanding of the plain man.

No objection is here raised to simplification as such. On the contrary, no work could be more useful than that of presenting Marxism in such a way as can easily be assimilated by the ordinary man. What calls for protest is the fact that those who in Britain set out to “simplify” Marx commonly begin by reducing him to a _simpleton_, and those who offer to “explain” him are as a rule primarily concerned only to _explain him away_.

We take the ground here that Marx and Engels (and this applies also to Lenin and Stalin) are their own best expounders that to attempt to “simplify” that which they have already made as simple as it is humanly possible to make it, cannot fail to result in a distortion of their plain sense and a misrepresentation of their clearly-presented meaning. Not “simplification” but _amplification_ and, above all, _application_ is what Marxism needs in Britain.

#####   *  *  *  *  *  

As usually presented to the English-speaking world by its popular expositors, literary and oratorical, “Marxism” is a loosely aggregated bundle of separate and distinct “theories” which have no connection with each other beyond the fortuitous fact that they all originated with the one man, Karl Marx. Resolved thus into a jumble of “theories”—of Value, of Capital, of Crises, of History, of Class-War, of Revolution, and so on—each theory being presented as quite separate and self-contained—Marxism becomes an Old Curiosity Shop in which political amateurs and literary _dilettanti_ can rummage for decorative oddments, just as they rummage in the Caledonian Market for old china, pewter plates, and bawdy prints.

In this way it has become quite a tradition in Britain for men to pose as “Marxists” on the strength of wearing a “Marxist” feather in the hair, or fig leaf on their intellectual nakedness. Nobody laughs in Britain to hear of “Marxists” who are also Christians, Theosophists, Spiritualists, or even Thomists-men who contrive to divide their allegiance between Karl Marx and the Blessed Saint Thomas Aquinas, even as others, with equal solemnity, seek to effect a synthesis between the philosophies of Marxism and of the Herr Doktor Sigmund Freud.

This eclectic-opportunist trick of disrupting the living unity of Marxism into a rubbish-heap of incompatible fragments has in Britain received high academic approval. Here, for instance, are the words of the learned Professor of Political Science in the University of London:

“The essence of Marx’s work lies not in any special economic doctrine so much as in the _spirit_ by which this total accomplishment was performed. . . .

“Marxism as a social philosophy can be most usefully resolved into _four distinct parts_. It is first and foremost a _philosophy of history_ . . . it is a _theory of social development_ intended to guide the party of which he was a leader. Marx in the third place outlined a tactic. . . . He was, finally, an _economic theorist_.

“For Marx himself, of course, none of these aspects is properly separable from any other. They form a logical whole, the unity of which he would have passionately defended. It is, however, possible to reject the validity of his economic system, while accepting the large outlines of his social theory.”—Professor H. J. LASKI: _Communism_, pp. 22-26.

That this may fairly be taken as representative of what passes for “Marxism” in Britain is evidenced by the fact that Professor Laski has, without in any way modifying the opinion above cited, taken of late to calling himself a “Marxist.” As such he has been welcomed with acclaim into the “Marxist” camp, even to the extent of being chosen as the chief speaker at the function organised by the (_Marxist_) National Council of Labour Colleges to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Karl Marx.

Professor Laski exhibits, in the quotation given above, a characteristic common to the whole British school of “explainers” of Marx. _He takes it calmly for granted that he understands Marxism far better than Marx understood it himself!_ Marx, he argues, would have “defended passionately” _the logical unity_ of his theoretical system. But herein, according to Professor Laski, Karl Marx was self-deluded. Marxism, he affirms, can be “separated” into parts capable of being considered in complete isolation. So, we might retort, is Professor Laski capable of being “separated” from his head, his lights, or his liver! But in that case he would cease to be Professor Laski. And in like manner a Marxism disrupted is not Marxism, but a mangled corpse.

Professor Laski, however, sins in thoroughly respectable company. Here is a choice specimen of what has passed in Britain for a critical evaluation of Marxist doctrine:

“There are two remarkable inconsistencies between the general sociological position taken up by Marx and Engels and their persistent assertion of the economic basis of history. . . . In the first place they agreed that . . . ‘the whole world, natural, historical, intellectual, is represented as a process, i.e., as in constant motion, change, transformation, development.’ If that be true, is it conceivable that every department of life ‘natural, historical, intellectual’ (by the way, a very slipshod division)—is _chained_ to economics and cannot attain an independent development and existence of its own? In the second place, Marx’s insistence that each epoch has its own characteristic law of development is inconsistent with the assertion that economic considerations are the prime movers in historic evolution.”—J. RAMSAY MACDONALD: _Socialism and Society_, p. 42.

This passage, so sublime in its owlish stupidity, so ludicrous in its spurious profundity, is truly characteristic of Ramsay MacDonald; but, as is apparent from its family likeness to the quotation from Professor Laski, it is none the less characteristic of the whole “British” school of Marxian interpretation.

That MacDonald, of all men living or dead, should accuse _anybody_ (let alone Engels!) of “slipshod” thought or speech is MacDonaldite _in excelsis_. It should not, however, prevent us from noting that in failing to perceive any reason for the allocation of the phenomena of universal development into just those departments—of Nature, of History, and of the Thought-process in itself—MacDonald follows the fashion of his school in treating as of no account the fundamental dialectical _method_ whereby the conclusions of Marx and Engels were reached.

Similarly MacDonald, faced with an affirmation that the entire universe is in constant movement, finds a “contradiction” between that affirmation and the assertion that history has an “economic basis.” Why? Because this latter assertion, to MacDonald (and his school), means that “every department of life” (who said “slipshod”?) “is _chained_ to economics.”

Since to Marx the term “economics” denotes a _movement_—“the sum and total of human productive activity—with its objective outcome”—and was therefore “a department of life” (in the MacDonaldite sense)—to talk of mankind’s non-economic activities being “chained” to their economic ones is as illuminating as to speak of a man being “chained” to his own feet or bowels. To resent the fact that the life activities of men in their social inter-relations are, however various, all interdependent, is, in effect, to demand a physiology in which digestion goes on without intestines and is quite “independent” of food or feeding.

Likewise MacDonald sees in the assertion that historic epochs have differing laws of development a contradiction to the assertion that in historical evolution economic determinants are primary. Why? To Marx epochs are distinguishable each from each precisely by means of differences, progressively developed, in the economic constitution of society. For MacDonald, on the other hand, as for the true-blue British school of economists, “economic laws” are part of the _fixed and immutable_ order of Nature, and can no more _change_ than the lions in Trafalgar Square can lay eggs.

In short, MacDonald herein places himself critically on a par with that soldier in the British force sent in 1919 to overthrow the Soviet regime who was given a pot of caviare as part of his loot. “This here _jam_,” said he, “tastes _fishy_!” MacDonald complains of Marx’s doctrine that it is neither metaphysical, eclectic, nor idealist, but _Dialectical_ and _Materialist_.

A significant change has overtaken the attitude of the British intelligentsia towards Marx and Marxism—a change not unconnected with the continuance of the world depression and the failure of every effort to overthrow the (_Marxist_) Communist regime in the U.S.S.R. Marx is now by general consent admitted to the ranks of the very greatest intellects of all time, while Dialectical Materialism—the _method_ and _world-conception_ of Marx and Marxism—is beginning to be discussed, for the truly “British” reason that it is “the official (!) philosophy” of the U.S.S.R.

It would therefore seem to be timely to direct attention to the essential _unity_ of Marxism and to its validity as a guide to action. As against all the critics, belittlers, revisers and explainers of Marx, we affirm, and seek herein to prove, that in the fifty years and more which have elapsed since Marx died events have so completely vindicated his standpoint, his method, and his main conclusions that his doctrine is, in general, _truer to-day than when it was first formulated_.

This is, we affirm, not only true objectively in the sense that developments have in fact made actual the situations and inter-relations which Marx and Engels had the genius to foresee and to predict, but true also subjectively, in the sense that the working-class in Britain, and with it its allies in the ranks of the intelligentsia and the progressive middle and upper classes, are better prepared, theoretically, to _begin_ to comprehend Marxist theory than they were in Marx’s own lifetime—than they ever have been at any time previous to this time present.

That consideration has determined the form of this essay as well as its substance. As to the latter, it will be perceived that, far from making any attempt to carry Marxist theory _beyond_ the point at which Marx left it, the main, virtually the sole, purpose of this essay, is to demonstrate the point at which Marxist theory _began_.

The respects in which, for instance, Lenin, and following Lenin, Stalin, have extended and amplified Marxist theory are dealt with herein only so far as is necessary to establish their essential connection with the basic presuppositions and method of Marx and Engels themselves.

For that reason the earlier chapters of this essay are devoted to an attempt to elucidate, with the aid of Marx’s _Theses on Feuerbach_—herein taken as the seminal form of Marxian Theory,—the whole philosophical and political-theoretical background from which Marxism took its rise. That this entails what will seem, at first glance, to be a highly disconnected survey of the _incidentals_ of the Marxist world-conception, is a circumstance which was unavoidable. It has the methodological advantage of presenting Marxism in its embryonic phases as a preliminary to, and as an elucidation of, the theory in its fully matured form.

The continuity of the earlier chapters, and more or less of the whole work, is, furthermore, interrupted by frequent digressions in which the objections and mis-presentations of the would-be “simplifiers” of Marx are disposed of. This was necessary to the purpose of the essay—since it is precisely the efforts of these “simplifiers” which constitute to-day the chief obstacle to the general understanding and acceptance of Marx’s theory and practice. To those who find these “interruptions” of the argument an annoyance sympathy is extended, but no apology. To such readers I offer a hint borrowed from Heine:

“If you who read become tired of the ‘stupid’ stuff herein, just think of what a dreary time I must have had in writing it! I would recommend you, on the whole, once in a while to skip half a dozen leaves, for in that way you will arrive much sooner at the end.”—HEINE: _The Baths of Lucca_, Chap. IX.

For readers with stouter stomachs, and a better comprehension of the purpose in view, we note that after the survey of the _Theses on Feuerbach_ the essay deals in succession with the relations between the Marxist conceptions of Nature and of History; and between those of History and of Revolution in general and the Proletarian Revolution in particular. Here again the purpose is not to advance any new or original speculations, but, on the contrary, to explore the route by which Marx and Engels reached the conceptions for which they are famous. Superficially these chapters might seem to be guilty of the rashness of challenging comparison with (particularly) Engels’ classic expositions, _Ludwig Feuerbach_ and _Anti-Dühring_. A more careful reading will show that they are designed expressly to enable a reader to begin the reading of those masterpieces (and with them every work of Marx and of Lenin—particularly the latter’s _Materialism and Empirio-Criticism_) with a fuller and a better comprehension of their purpose than has hitherto commonly been brought to their study in Britain.

In the culminating chapter four selected “man-handlers” of the Marxist Dialectic are critically examined at full length. This is done in order to complete the exposition by demonstrating, in sequence with the preceding chapters, the general connection between the Marxist conception of understanding (its subjective Dialectics) and its conceptions of Nature, History, and Revolution (its objective Dialectics). The four victims chosen for this special treatment have been so selected because they are typical of the main trends of divergence from the true line of Marxist advance observable in the Marxist movement in Britain to-day.

No apology is offered for the _manner_ of this criticism:

“It’s war we’re in; not _politics!_  
It’s _systems_ wrastling now, not _parties_.  
And vict’ry in the end’ll fix  
Where longest will and truest heart is!”  
—LOWELL.

The author has been far too occupied with the problem of attaining accuracy to find time to study politeness.

The translations from Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin which have page references are taken from the editions published by Messrs. Martin Lawrence (who were good enough to place at the author’s disposal advance copies of their more recent issues), except, of course, in the cases of Marx’s _Capital_ (Vol. I, Sonnenschein edition; Vols. II and III, Kerr’s edition) Engels’ _Socialism Utopian and Scientific_ and his _Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844_ (Allen and Unwin). The extracts from the Marx-Engels _Correspondence_ have been taken from the Martin Lawrence edition translated by Dona Torr. For other translations from Marx, Engels and Heine the present author accepts all blame. I have also to thank Messrs. Martin Lawrence for many acts of help and encouragement; and those comrades who have looked over the MSS. and the proofs and made helpful suggestions deserve a public acknowledgement likewise. Neither of these comrades is to be blamed for any faults found herein; on the contrary, the reader has them to thank for the fact that there are not many more.

The corrections in this second edition have been confined almost wholly to proof-reader’s corrections. In two places, not affecting the argument, the statement of a matter o£ fact has been rectified. Otherwise the work remains unaltered.

# Dialectics After Derrida

## talk by Geoff Boucher at [Hegel-Marx-Derrida Seminar](http://home.mira.net/~andy/seminars/hegel00.htm), Melbourne 19th February 2000.

Who _is_ Jacques Derrida and _what does he want_?? In one sense, we all 'know' who Jacques Derrida is. Derrida is the idealist who thinks that the whole world is a text. Derrida is the guy who thinks that philosophy is just another type of literature. Derrida is the fellow who claims that writing comes before speech.

So many false assumptions and second hand opinions circulate in relation to Jacques Derrida and the intervention popularly known as deconstruction, that it's difficult to know where to begin. I can only ask you to perform a sort of 'bracketing' of everything you think you know about deconstruction, in order to focus on what Derrida actually says.

There are a number of reasons why we should pay attention to Derrida. For if deconstruction is right, then we have yet to think collectively. We have yet to draw the full consequences from our social being. And we have yet to theorise praxis from a position that is not tied to what Derrida calls the metaphysics of subjectivity.

Derrida also exposes the political consequences of some apparently marginal philosophical assumptions. One of Derrida's arguments is that we should not underestimate the power and rigour of philosophy. All attempts to 'defend' philosophy by attacking the 'irrelevance' of Derrida's interventions would in fact reflect rather poorly on the standards of logical argument we presume philosophers to have. Another one of Derrida's arguments is that these assumptions are not 'mistakes' that can be corrected, but in fact are vital to the logical consistency and argumentative power that we expect from philosophy.

## Dialectics and Deconstruction

Deconstruction is _not_ about writing, or difference. Nor is it about how any totality is surrounded by "an irreducible surplus of meaning". Deconstruction involves an inquiry into the conditions of possibility and impossibility of philosophy. It is a question of uncovering what Derrida calls "a type of 'structural unconscious' ... which seems alien, if not incompatible with [philosophy] given its current axiomatics". [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#1) This 'structural unconscious' - _différance_ - provides the transcendental conditions of possibility and impossibility for philosophical rigor. Yet it is not a question of a critique in the Kantian sense - a delimitation of the legitimate employment of reason - nor a project of landing in some region 'beyond metaphysics' (say, for instance, science). For Derrida, philosophy - including speculative totalisation - is both rigorous and necessary. It is also erected upon a series of blindspots that render the quest for truth of philosophy deeply problematic. These problems are intractable. There is a politics associated with the solutions to these problems. It is therefore a question of inscribing philosophy within a field that exceeds it, that makes it possible as an activity and simultaneously undermines its foundations, and that explains the political stakes involved in the apparently natural gestures by which philosophy produces concepts. Derrida somewhere says that this field - _différance_ - could be called history, were it not for the teleological resonances of that term.

This would be, for instance, a non-totalisable history. That is not to say that totalis_ation_ - as an operation involving a summing up relative to the expectation of meaning from some interpretation or a determination of the factors essential to some project - is not a valid and necessary procedure. Derrida remarks in _Of Grammatology_ that the point of intervention of a deconstructive reading is the outcome of an historical hermeneutics, ie. a determination of the meaning of a region of history for the purposes of intervening against injustice. It is simply that this totalisation is never _the totality_.

This is the main reason why deconstruction views Hegel as _the_ key antagonist. Hegel's work, Derrida argues, occupies an ambivalent position within the history of Western philosophy. On the one hand, "he undoubtedly summed up the entire philosophy of the _logos_. He determined ontology as absolute logic; he assembled all the delimitations of philosophy as presence; he assigned to presence the eschatology of _parousia_ [spirit], of the self-proximity of infinite subjectivity". [[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#2) At the same time, however, Hegel announces the advent of the closure of metaphysics. Hegel is the philosopher who begins to think irreducible difference and tries to hold this difference within the logic of the unfolding of an "identity of identity and difference". With the Hegelian argument that it is only in the medium of language that intersubjective community is possible, language begins to invade the heart of the problems of philosophy. This will make possible a thinking which will seek to no longer be governed by the search for a 'transcendental signified' guaranteeing the transmission of meaning, knowledge and truth without remainder. Hegel therefore appears as "the last philosopher of the Book and the first philosopher of writing". [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#3) This determines the strategic character of deconstruction's intervention into speculative dialectics. "If there were a definition of _différance_," Derrida notes, "it would be precisely the limit, the interruption, the destruction of the Hegelian dialectical synthesis _wherever_ it operates". [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#4)

Derrida's concern is ethical. In the words of Simon Critchley: "can philosophical dialectics approach the otherness of the other, that is to say, can it entertain an alterity that cannot be comprehended or reduced to an object of cognition or recognition?". [[Knowledge of MIA 5]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#5) Or, as Derrida puts it in _Of Grammatology_, "logocentrism is nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism". [[Avisen og dens læsere-1721247175625.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#6) This ethnocentrism is expressed principally in the persistent tendency for philosophy to ratify as _de jure_ what is in reality _de facto_. In the context of the 'will to totality' of philosophy - including the drive to logical coherence and rhetorical consistency that constitute philosophy as rigorous and necessary - this means the triumph of the positivity of knowledge and being over the negativity of dispersion and non-existence. Hegel's dialectic - with its guarantee that within the 'rememoration of world history,' that is to say, the recuperation of the meaning of history from the fragments of historical events - represents a prime exhibit of this tendency. Within the dialectic, negation as determination preserves the totality of meaning and transmits it from one moment to the next, without remainder.

But for Derrida there is something laughable about the pompous seriousness of the Hegelian negative. In, for instance, the master/slave dialectic, this negative huffs and puffs with the business of the 'struggle to the death for recognition' whilst secretly guaranteeing that real death, death as finitude and the simple absence of meaning, is excluded from the start, since "death is the _natural_ negation of consciousness, negation without independence, which thus remains without the required significance of recognition". [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#7) Death fails to signify meaningfully and is therefore excluded from the dialectical synthesis. Like the peoples 'without history' and those with a non-phonetic writing, it simply drops out of the equation, enabling the speculative totalisation of world history and the condition of mutual recognition. At the same time, it allows _philosophy_ to be both the agency of death and the vehicle for immortality, that is to say, to speak the master discourse of the overcoming of human finitude.

## Exteriority and Alienation in Hegel

Central to this 'structural unconscious' driving the axiomatics of philosophy is the assumption of the priority of speech over writing, which underpins what Derrida has called 'logocentric metaphysics'. To think logocentrically, according to Derrida, is to dream of a 'transcendental signified,' a meaning outside and beyond the differential play of language that would stop the potentially infinite process of interpretation and guarantee the transmission of meaning. The assumed priority of speech is based on the myth of the complete coincidence of meaning and intention in the moment of 'hearing/understanding oneself speak,' where the living voice guarantees the mutual understanding (and self-understanding) of persons. By contrast, the dead letter of writing - where the author is no longer present to govern the transmission of the meaning of the text via the voice of authorial intention - can only, for philosophy, present the disastrous spectacle of a meaning that permanently threatens to go astray. This works itself out in Hegel's philosophy as the privilege granted to phonetic script over other forms of writing.

Spirit, for Hegel, must externalise itself in its other (nature and humanity) to truly know itself. The medium for this self recognition is language. Hegel's treatment of language is not a subjective mistake under the influence of his time, but completely consistent with the tradition of Western philosophy since Plato and internally necessary to his system of absolute idealism. Hegel determines speech as the natural state of language and concludes that phonetic writing is a faithful transcription of the voice, while non-phonetic writing - hieroglyphics, for instance - as that which has no clear relation to the living voice and requires _deciphering_, is beneath the interest of philosophy. For it is only in spoken language, and the phonetic writing that faithfully records the intentions of the author, that there is this apparently ideal coincidence of meaning and intention. Hieroglyphics fails to make this passage by way of the 'natural' bond between voice, self-present intention and the meaning of a discourse.

Hegel is confusing the natural attitude where intention governs meaning with the logical basis for communicative acts. But there is in phonetic writing that which is non-phonetic: an irreducible graphic component, including a differential spacing, which is marked by the arbitrariness of notational conventions. This worries Hegel. When he comes to Leibniz's project of a logical calculus expressed in written form, Hegel dismisses this as an exaggeration of the 'practical mind'. What the 'practical mind' fails to grasp is the necessity for the concept to pass by way of the natural link between sound and sense as captured by phonetic language ie. the speculative and idealist aspect of Hegel's treatment of language.

## Context and Intentionality

In order to deepen this appreciation of what Derrida is driving at and its implications for dialectics, we have to pursue him further into the deconstruction of the idealism of the bond between speech and intention. For Derrida is _not_ trying to 'rehabilitate' writing. He is delving into what grounds the difference between speech and writing and makes this opposition possible whilst simultaneously undermining it.

In Derrida's engagement with 'ordinary language philosophy' we encounter again the elevation of the natural attitude into a metaphysics of communication with normative overtones. In response to Derrida's demonstration of the lack of a transcendental signified at the center of any structure - and the consequent inability to make a final delimitation of context for any enunciation or an ultimate determination of the meaning of an utterance - the English philosopher John Searle accused Derrida of a destruction of meaning and a denial of the obvious pragmatic character of communicative acts. Any written or spoken interaction, Searle argued, is governed by the fact that it is an attempt to communicate a meaning. The very fact that there _is_ meaning - that it can be spoken of - implies that the speaker's intention or the context of writing limit the possible spread of meanings. Indeed, Searle claimed, it makes it possible to determine _the_ meaning of a discourse.

But this is to miss entirely the point of Derrida's intervention. For ordinary language philosophy, the 'pragmatic character of communicative acts' is famously separable into the 'performative' element - the practical action performed by an utterance - and the 'constative' element - the substantive meaning conveyed by the signifying chain. 'I baptise this ship _Titanic_' performs the launching of the ship while announcing the constative meaning that its name will be 'Titanic'. This is supposed to fix speech-acts outside of any 'reduction' to a semiotic theory of meaning, for while the constative value of an utterance remains under the sign of the intention of the speaker, the performative value of the speech act has to be located within a precise context. (Speech act theory talks of the "total context".) Yet Derrida's argument is that this performativity of a speech act represents a kind of ritual that is the very definition of something that can be carried outside of any given context and repeated indefinitely. "The performative is a 'communication' which is not limited strictly to the transference of a semantic content that is already constituted and dominated by an orientation towards truth". [[Gramsci Vores Marx (1918)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#8) This argument can be applied to constatives as well, insofar as the act of speech is accompanied by the performative force of the gesture of communication. This 'iterability' of a speech act is not the deviant property of a handful of social rituals but the precondition for language to signify: for if speech acts were not in principle iterable, then the communicative value of words would be so context-dependent that _only_ the speaker could know what was meant. It is this generalised iterability of all speech acts, however, that determines that no _final_ delimitation of the context of an utterance can be made.

It is this 'generalised iterability' that makes the _difference_ between performatives and constatives possible, while at the same time rendering the precise specification of that difference unsustainable. It is this 'generalised iterability' that I want to turn to now, since it is only the moment of the reinscription of the binary opposition within the field of these 'quasi-transcendental' structures - like arche-writing, supplementarity, _différance_ and generalised iterability - that breaks with dialectics. This is what deconstruction is 'really' all about.

## Quasi-Transcendentals

To grasp what is happening with the production of these 'conditions of possibility and impossibility' we have to turn to Derrida's early work, where he deconstructs the works of the philosopher who, for Derrida, is the "greatest since the Greeks" - Edmund Husserl. Husserlian phenomenology took a stand against the prevalent relativism of the first part of the twentieth century and the relegation of philosophy to a minor place in the field of the 'human sciences'. Husserl argued that there was a crucial distinction to be made between the fact that some empirical content was presented to consciousness and the essential characteristics of _what_ was presented. By bracketing all natural assumptions and theoretical constructions of the phenomenon (even to the point of suspending belief in the existence of the external world) Husserl claimed to be able to zero in on the productive _act_ of consciousness as it produced both cultural categories of experience and the perception of the empirical contents. Thus, whatever the causes of experience and belief discovered by scientific investigation, such discoveries cannot affect the intrinsic meaning of phenomena, as these are initially revealed to consciousness. This unprejudiced description of the essential structures of experience will constitute a new, rigorous science of philosophy that will place the empirical sciences _and_ the humanities on a self-certain basis. Husserl claimed to be producing not a description of this or that culture's transcendental categories but of the transcendental act by which _any_ culture could possibly conceive of a history, a culture and a science.

Now, Derrida, in his introduction to Husserl's _Origins of Geometry_ agrees with the anti-relativist thrust of Husserl's procedure. Implicitly arguing against structuralism, with its objectivist reduction of meaning to an effect of the differential relationships between terms in a structure and its consequent flattening of the subject onto 'subject positions' within structural locations, Derrida argues that "the notion of structure presupposes at least a rigorous delimitation of prior regions [of experience], and this elucidation of the meaning of each regional structure can only be based on a phenomenological critique. The latter is always first _by right_ ..." [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#9)

This approach is equally in evidence later on, for instance when Derrida accuses Foucault of failing to grasp that the Cartesian _cogito_ has the status of a productive act of consciousness, as the "zero point where determinate meaning and non-meaning join in their common origin". [[10 dage der rystede verden]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#10) Or in _Grammatology_, where Derrida argues that the linguist Hjelmslev has failed to pose the question of the "condition of all linguistic systems". Hjelmslev remains on the terrain of the natural attitude and its contamination of philosophical rigor by the empirical materials of this or that linguistic prejudice. "The parenthesizing of regions of experience or of the totality of natural experience must discover a field of transcendental experience. This experience is only accessible insofar as after having, like Hjelmslev, isolated the specificity of the linguistic system and excluded all the extrinsic sciences and metaphysical speculations, one asks the question of the transcendental origin of the system itself." [[Knowledge of MIA]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#11) As late as the 1974 interview _Positions_, Derrida is arguing that "what I first learned about this critique [of relativism] from Husserl ... seems to me to be valid in its argumentative schema". [["Venstre"kommunisme - en børnesygdom-1721231934104.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#12)

However, this is only a part of Derrida's argument, since he also directs his investigation towards the "un-thought out axiomatics of the Husserlian phenomenology". IN Husserl's _Origins of Geometry_, Husserl concludes that writing is a necessary condition for the transmission of the ideal objectivity of scientific principles. This is because it is only by the detachment from any actual subjectivity that writing makes possible that the objectivity and communicability that constitute the scientific status of science can be achieved. "Speech," Derrida writes, "is no longer simply the expression of what, without it would already be already an object, caught in its primordial purity: speech constitutes the object and is a concrete juridical condition of truth. Without the fall back into language and thereby into history, a fall which would alienated the ideal purity of sense, sense would remain an empirical formation imprisoned in as fact in an actual subjectivity - _in the inventor's head_. Historical incarnation sets free the transcendental instead of binding it. This last notion, the transcendental, must then be rethought." [[Breve til Kongressen (Testementet) v13 ALT 1]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/gb2000_3.htm#13)

Indeed, for Derrida, the presence of speech in the constitution of ideal objectivity - entailing a relationship between the speaking subject and language, alterity and time - means the introduction of difference into the supposedly self-present origin of consciousness. Husserl's attempt to erase the 'external' and 'indicative' functions of language through a series of bracketings which culminate in a self-addressed inner voice of consciousness, is condemned to failure. There is no domain of 'phenomenological silence' prior to the representational (hence divisive) workings of language. Furthermore, this 'intrusion' of facticity is linked to the failure of present consciousness to be a point like apprehension of the "Living Present". When Husserl admits that present consciousness is inseparable from future and past - modes of awareness that are _neither_ the representation of absence nor the intuition of presence, then the immediacy of self-presence, upon which Husserl's conceptions of evidence and truth depend, is revealed as an illusion ie the collapse of Husserl's project. The conclusion flows necessarily: "difference would then be transcendental". In other words, the permanent evidential gap within phenomenology itself, which appears as the result of the intrusion of facticity and historicity, is the effect of a transcendental structure more fundamental than consciousness. This, I would suggest, is what Derrida earlier in my presentation alluded to as a 'structural unconscious'.

Derrida calls this 'structural unconscious' _différance_, which is a neologism combining implications of differing and defering (amongst five possible functions), but which, is only a written mark, without meaning or direct existence. It is the movement of _différance_ - and its other correlative quasi-transcendentals - that produces the transcendental subject as the subject in and of language and history. It is this chain of quasi-transcendentals that opens, "in one and the same possibility, temporalization as well as the relationship with the other and language".

## Deconstruction and Dialectics

Deconstruction proceeds by a "double gesture" - a phase of reversal and a phase of reinscription or displacement. Deconstruction starts with an interrogation of a variety of contradictions or aporias in the discourse of philosophy. These are not contradictions or aporias proper, however, since the discourse of philosophy accomodates them without difficulty. All these aporias, differences of levels, inequalities of development and disparities characteristic of the discourse of philosophy yet do not seem to disturb the logic of philosophy - indeed, they are necessary to the establishment of that (indispensible) logic. All the gestures of philosophy - reflection and transcendentality, especially themes of subjectivity, transcendentality, freedom, origin, truth, presence and the proper - are impossible without the differences and discrepancies that permeate the texts of philosophy. Yet these same disparities also limit the scope of these gestures and the purity and coherence of the philosophical concepts and themes.

Deconstruction is an attempt to account for these heterogeneous aprorias and discursive inequalities using quasi-transcendentals, like _différance_. These minimal structures are both the grounds of possibility of totalisation and the constitution of philosophical concepts, and their ungrounding in the play of signification within a non-delimited context. These structures limit what they make possible by rendering its rigor and purity impossible. Deconstruction does not merely set itself to destroy metaphysical concepts; it shows how metaphysics draws its possibility from that which makes it impossible.

Derrida demonstrates this through the movement of textuality that he calls 'dissemination'. Dissemination is not 'uncontrolled freeplay' but a carefully controlled demonstration of the repressed semantic possibilities of any 'text' - of any experience - which arises at the "zero point where determinate meaning and non-meaning join in their common origin'. This is different to hermeneutics, with its potentially infinite process of interpretation. For hermeneutics, the recovery of meaning always takes place within a horizon of the expectation of meaning. Derrida raises the possibility of bursting this semantic horizon with the possibility that non-meaning might be inextricably intertwined with meaning. There is a strongly existential overtone to this demonstration.

Likewise, dissemination is different to structuralist interpretation, which in Derrida's terms, reduces meaning to the effect of structure. _Différance_, Derrida has argued, is about what _escapes_ the metaphysical reduction to language on the model of ideal communication. It is not about, as some have argued, a misrecognition of discourse as composed solely of diacritical marks, as if the positive existence of words whose historically sedimented (multiple) meanings might be the other of the differential structure of language, had gone over Derrida's head. Derrida insists, time and time again, that the purpose of deconstruction is precisely to pay attention to this historical and pragmatic character of language.

Finally, it is not the same as speculative totalisation through Hegelian dialectics. It is about what is heterogeneous to the ideality of meaning and to the assimilation of being to thinking. Its demonstration that language is not the inert medium for the transmission of thought but - as an intersubjective medium shaped historically and pragmatically - contains that which exceeds the intentions of the supposedly self-conscious subject. It explodes speculative totalisation.

It is closest to Marxism and psychoanalysis. This is not to say that the paradoxes identified by Derrida would simply vanish from a sociological perspective. For while the relationship to Husserl suggests that deconstruction is locating the effects of praxis at the level of consciousness, Derrida's point would surely be that the _thinking of praxis_ can only proceed through Western metaphysics. It is at that level that praxis itself has to be rethought.

# XII. Dialectics.  
Quantity and Quality

“The first and most important principle of the basic logical properties of being refers to the _exclusion of contradiction._ Contradiction is a category which can only appertain to a combination of thoughts, but not to reality. There are no contradictions in things, or, to put it another way, contradiction accepted as reality is itself the apex of absurdity {D. Ph. 30} ... The antagonism of forces measured against each other and moving in opposite directions is in fact the basic form of all actions m the life of the world and its creatures. But this opposition of the directions taken by the forces of elements and individuals does not in the slightest degree coincide with the idea of absurd contradictions {31} ... We can be content here with having cleared the fogs which generally rise from the supposed mysteries of logic by presenting a clear picture of the actual absurdity of contradictions in reality and with having shown the uselessness of the incense which has been burnt here and there in honour of the dialectics of contradiction — the very clumsily carved wooden doll which is substituted for the antagonistic world schematism” {32}

This is practically all we are told about dialectics in the _Cursus der Philosophie._ In his _Kritische Geschichte_, on the other hand, the dialectics of contradiction, and with it particularly Hegel, is treated quite differently.

“Contradiction, according to the Hegelian logic, or rather Logos doctrine, is objectively present not in thought, which by its nature can only be conceived as subjective and conscious, but in things and processes themselves and can be met with in so to speak corporeal form, so that absurdity does not remain an impossible combination of thought but becomes an actual force. The reality of the absurd is the first article of faith in the Hegelian unity of the logical and the illogical.... The more contradictory a thing the truer it is, or in other words, the more absurd the more credible it is. This maxim, which is not even newly invented but is borrowed from the theology of the Revelation and from mysticism, is the naked expression of the so-called dialectical principle” {D. K. G. 479-80}.

The thought-content of the two passages cited can be summed up in the statement that contradiction=absurdity, and therefore cannot occur in the real world. People who in other respects show a fair degree of common sense may regard this statement as having the same self-evident validity as the statement that a straight line cannot be a curve and a curve cannot be straight. But, regardless of all protests made by common sense, the differential calculus under certain circumstances nevertheless equates straight lines and curves, and thus obtains results which common sense, insisting on the absurdity of straight lines being identical with curves, can never attain. And in view of the important role which the so-called dialectics of contradiction has played in philosophy from the time of the ancient Greeks up to the present, even a stronger opponent than Herr Dühring should have felt obliged to attack it with other arguments besides one assertion and a good many abusive epithets.

True, so long as we consider things as at rest and lifeless, each one by itself, alongside and after each other, we do not run up against any contradictions in them. We find certain qualities which are partly common to, partly different from, and even contradictory to each other, but which in the last-mentioned case are distributed among different objects and therefore contain no contradiction within. Inside the limits of this sphere of observation we can get along on the basis of the usual, metaphysical mode of thought. But the position is quite different as soon as we consider things in their motion, their change, their life, their reciprocal influence on one another. Then we immediately become involved in contradictions. Motion itself is a contradiction: even simple mechanical change of position can only come about through a body being at one and the same moment of time both in one place and in another place, being in one and the same place and also not in it. And the continuous origination and simultaneous solution of this contradiction is precisely what motion is.

Here, therefore, we have a contradiction which “is objectively present in things and processes themselves and can be met with in so to speak corporeal form”. And what has Herr Dühring to say about it? He asserts that

up to the present there is “no bridge” whatever “in rational mechanics from the strictly static to the dynamic” {D. Ph. 80}.

The reader can now at last see what is hidden behind this favourite phrase of Herr Dühring’s — it is nothing but this: the mind which thinks metaphysically is absolutely unable to pass from the idea of rest to the idea of motion, because the contradiction pointed out above blocks its path. To it, motion is simply incomprehensible because it is a contradiction. And in asserting the incomprehensibility of motion, it admits against its will the existence of this contradiction, and thus admits the objective presence in things and processes themselves of a contradiction which is moreover an actual force.

If simple mechanical change of position contains a contradiction this is even more true of the higher forms of motion of matter, and especially of organic life and its development. We saw above that life consists precisely and primarily in this — that a being is at each moment itself and yet something else. Life is therefore also a contradiction which is present in things and processes themselves, and which constantly originates and resolves itself; and as soon as the contradiction ceases, life, too, comes to an end, and death steps in. We likewise saw that also in the sphere of thought we could not escape contradictions, and that for example the contradiction between man's inherently unlimited capacity for knowledge and its actual presence only in men who are externally limited and possess limited cognition finds its solution in what is — at least practically, for us — an endless succession of generations, in infinite progress.

We have already noted that one of the basic principles of higher mathematics is the contradiction that in certain circumstances straight lines and curves may be the same. It also gets up this other contradiction: that lines which intersect each other before our eyes nevertheless, only five or six centimetres from their point of intersection, can be shown to be parallel, that is, that they will never meet even if extended to infinity. And yet, working with these and with even far greater contradictions, it attains results which are not only correct but also quite unattainable for lower mathematics.

But even lower mathematics teems with contradictions. It is for example a contradiction that a root of A should be a power of A, and yet A1/2 = ![square root of A](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ad02.gif). It is a contradiction that a negative quantity should be the square of anything, for every negative quantity multiplied by itself gives a positive square. The square root of minus one is therefore not only a contradiction, but even an absurd contradiction, a real absurdity. And yet ![square root of minus one](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ad01.gif) is in many cases a necessary result of correct mathematical operations. Furthermore, where would mathematics — lower or higher — be, if it were prohibited from operation with ![square root of minus one](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ad01.gif)?

In its operations with variable quantities mathematics itself enters the field of dialectics, and it is significant that it was a dialectical philosopher, Descartes, who introduced this advance. The relation between the mathematics of variable and the mathematics of constant quantities is in general the same as the relation of dialectical to metaphysical thought. But this does not prevent the great mass of mathematicians from recognising dialectics only in the sphere of mathematics, and a good many of them from continuing to work in the old, limited, metaphysical way with methods that were obtained dialectically.

It would be possible to go more closely into Herr Dühring’s antagonism of forces and his antagonistic world schematism only if he had given us something more on this theme than the mere _phrase_. After accomplishing this feat this antagonism is not even once shown to us at work, either in his world schematism or in his natural philosophy — the most convincing admission that Herr Dühring can do absolutely nothing of a positive character with his “basic form of all actions in the life of the world and its creatures”. When someone has in fact lowered Hegel’s “Doctrine of Essence” to the platitude of forces moving in opposite directions but not in contradictions, certainly the best thing he can do is to avoid any application of this commonplace.

Marx's _Capital_ furnishes Herr Dühring with another occasion for venting his anti-dialectical spleen.

“The absence of natural and intelligible logic which characterises these dialectical frills and mazes and conceptual arabesques... Even to the part that has already appeared we must apply the principle that in a certain respect and also in general” (!), “according to a well-known philosophical preconception, all is to be sought in each and each in all, and that therefore, according to this mixed and misconceived idea, it all amounts to one and the same thing in the end” {D. K. G. 496}.

This insight into the well-known philosophical preconception also enables Herr Dühring to prophesy with assurance what will be the “end” of Marx's economic philosophising, that is, what the following volumes of _Capital_ will contain, and this he does exactly seven lines after he has declared that

“speaking in plain human language it is really impossible to divine what is still to come in the two” (final) “volumes” [[61]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/footnotes.htm#n61) {496}.

This, however, is not the first time that Herr Dühring’s writings are revealed to us as belonging to the “things” in which “contradiction is objectively present and can be met with in so to speak corporeal form” {479-80}. But this does not prevent him from going on victoriously as follows:

“Yet sound logic will in all probability triumph over its caricature... This presence of superiority and this mysterious dialectical rubbish will tempt no one who has even a modicum of sound judgment left to have anything to do ... with these deformities of thought and style. With the demise of the last relics of the dialectical follies this means of duping ... will lose its deceptive influence, and no one will any longer believe that he has to torture himself in order to get behind some profound piece of wisdom where the husked kernel of the abstruse things reveals at best the features of ordinary theories if not of absolute commonplaces... It is quite impossible to reproduce the” (Marxian) “maze in accordance with the Logos doctrine without prostituting sound logic” {D. K. C. 497}. Marx's method, according to Herr Dühring, consists in “performing dialectical miracles for his faithful followers” {498}, and so on.

We are not in any way concerned here as yet with the correctness or incorrectness of the economic results of Marx's researches, but only with the dialectical method used by Marx. But this much is certain: most readers of _Capital_ will have learnt for the first time from Herr Dühring what it is in fact that they have read. And among them will also be Herr Dühring himself, who in the year 1867 _(Ergänzungsblätter_ III, No. 3) was still able to provide what for a thinker of his calibre was a relatively rational review of the book; and he did this without first being obliged as he now declares is indispensable, to translate the Marxian argument into Dühringian language. And though even then he committed the blunder of identifying Marxian dialectics with the Hegelian, he had not quite lost the capacity to distinguish between the method and the results obtained by using it, and to understand that the latter are not refuted in detail by lampooning the former in general.

At any rate, the most astonishing piece of information given by Herr Dühring is the statement that from the Marxian standpoint “it all amounts to one and the same thing in the end” {496}, that therefore to Marx, for example, capitalists and wage-workers, feudal, capitalist and socialist modes of production are also “one and the same thing” — no doubt in the end even Marx and Herr Dühring are “one and the same thing”. Such utter nonsense can only be explained if we suppose that the mere mention of the word dialectics throws Herr Dühring into such a state of mental irresponsibility that, as a result of a certain mixed and misconceived idea, what he says and does is “one and the same thing” in the end.

We have here a sample of what Herr Dühring calls

“my historical depiction in the grand style” {556}, or “the summary treatment which settles with genus and type, and does not condescend to honour what a Hume called the learned mob with an exposure in micrological detail; this treatment in a higher and nobler style is the only one compatible with the interests of complete truth and with one's duty to the public which is free from the bonds of the guilds” {507}.

Historical depiction in the grand style and the summary settlement with genus and type is indeed very convenient for Herr Dühring, inasmuch as this method enables him to neglect all known facts as micrological and equate them to zero, so that instead of proving anything he need only use general phrases, make assertions and thunder his denunciations. The method has the further advantage that it offers no real foothold to an opponent, who is consequently left with almost no other possibility of reply than to make similar summary assertions in the grand style, to resort to general phrases and finally thunder back denunciations at Herr Dühring — in a word, as they say, engage in a clanging match, which is not to everyone“s taste. We must therefore be grateful to Herr Dühring for occasionally, by way of exception, dropping the higher and nobler style, and giving us at least two examples of the unsound Marxian Logos doctrine.

“How comical is the reference to the confused, hazy Hegelian notion that quantity changes into quality, and that therefore an advance, when it reaches a certain size, becomes capital by this quantitative increase alone” {498}.

In this “expurgated” presentation by Herr Dühring that statement certainly seems curious enough. Let us see how it looks in the original, in Marx. On page 313 (2nd edition of _Capital_), Marx, on the basis of his previous examination of constant and variable capital and surplus-value, draws the conclusion that “not every sum of money, or of value, is at pleasure transformable into capital. To effect this transformation, in fact, a certain minimum of money or of exchange-value must be presupposed in the hands of the individual possessor of money or commodities.” He takes as an example the case of a labourer in any branch of industry, who works daily eight hours for himself — that is, in producing the value of his wages — and the following four hours for the capitalist, in producing surplus-value, which immediately flows into the pocket of the capitalist. In this case, one would have to have at his disposal a sum of values sufficient to enable one to provide two labourers with raw materials, instruments of labour and wages, in order to pocket enough surplus-value every day to live on as well as one of his labourers. And as the aim of capitalist production is not mere subsistence but the increase of wealth, our man with his two labourers would still not be a capitalist. Now in order that he may live twice as well as an ordinary labourer, and turn half of the surplus-value produced again into capital, he would have to be able to employ eight labourers, that is, he would have to possess four times the sum of values assumed above. And it is only after this, and in the course of still further explanations elucidating and substantiating the fact that not every petty sum of values is enough to be transformable into capital, but that in this respect each period of development and each branch of industry has its definite minimum sum, that Marx observes: “Here, as in natural science, _is shown_ the correctness of the law discovered by Hegel in his _Logic_, that merely quantitative changes beyond a certain point pass into qualitative differences.”

And now let the reader admire the higher and nobler style, by virtue of which Herr Dühring attributes to Marx the opposite of what he really said. Marx says: The fact that a sum of values can be transformed into capital only when it has reached a certain size, varying according to the circumstances, but in each case definite minimum size — this fact is a _proof of the correctness_ of the Hegelian law. Herr Dühring makes him say: _Because_, according to the Hegelian law, quantity changes into quality, “_therefore_ an advance, when it reaches a certain size, becomes capital” {D. K. G. 498}. That is to say, the very opposite.

In connection with Herr Dühring’s examination of the Darwin case, we have already got to know his habit, “in the interests of complete truth” and because of his “duty to the public which is free from the bonds of the guilds” {507}, of quoting incorrectly. It becomes more and more evident that this habit is an inner necessity of the philosophy of reality, and it is certainly a very “summary treatment” {507}. Not to mention the fact that Herr Dühring further makes Marx speak of any kind of “advance” whatsoever, whereas Marx only refers to an advance made in the form of raw materials, instruments of labour, and wages; and that in doing this Herr Dühring succeeds in making Marx speak pure nonsense. And then he has the cheek to describe as _comic_ the nonsense which he himself has fabricated. Just as he built up a Darwin of his own fantasy in order to try out his strength against him, so here he builds up a fantastic Marx. “Historical depiction in the grand style” {556}, indeed!

We have already seen earlier, when discussing world schematism, that in connection with this Hegelian nodal line of measure relations — in which quantitative change suddenly passes at certain points into qualitative transformation — Herr Dühring had a little accident: in a weak moment he himself recognised and made use of this line. We gave there one of the best-known examples — that of the change of the aggregate states of water, which under normal atmospheric pressure changes at 0° C from the liquid into the solid state, and at 100°C from the liquid into the gaseous state, so that at both these turning-points the merely quantitative change of temperature brings about a qualitative change in the condition of the water.

In proof of this law we might have cited hundreds of other similar facts from nature as well as from human society. Thus, for example, the whole of Part IV of Marx's _Capital_ — production of relative surplus-value — deals, in the field of co-operation, division of labour and manufacture, machinery and modern industry, with innumerable cases in which quantitative change alters the quality, and also qualitative change alters the quantity, of the things under consideration; in which therefore, to use the expression so hated by Herr Dühring, quantity is transformed into quality and vice versa. As for example the fact that the co-operation of a number of people, the fusion of many forces into one single force, creates, to use Marx's phrase, a “new power”, which is essentially different from the sum of its separate forces.

Over and above this, in the passage which, in the interests of complete truth, Herr Dühring perverted into its opposite, Marx had added a footnote: “The molecular theory of modern chemistry first scientifically worked out by Laurent and Gerhardt rests on no other law.” But what did that matter to Herr Dühring? He knew that:

“the eminently modern educative elements provided by the natural-scientific mode of thought are lacking precisely among those who, like Marx and his rival Lassalle, make half-science and a little philosophistics the meagre equipment with which to vamp up their learning” {D. K. G. 504} —

while with Herr Dühring

“the main achievements of exact knowledge in mechanics, physics and chemistry” {D. Ph. 517} and so forth serve as the basis —

we have seen how. However, in order to enable third persons, too, to reach a decision in the matter, we shall look a little more closely into the example cited in Marx's footnote.

What is referred to here is the homologous series of carbon compounds, of which a great many are already known and each of which has its own algebraic formula of composition. If, for example, as is done in chemistry, we denote an atom of carbon by C, an atom of hydrogen by H, an atom of oxygen by O, and the number of atoms of carbon contained in each compound by n, the molecular formulas for some of these series can be expressed as follows:

CnH2n+2 — the series of normal paraffins  
CnH2n+2O — the series of primary alcohols  
CnH2nO2 — the series of the monobasic fatty acids.

Let us take as an example the last of these series, and let us assume successively that n=l, n=2, n=3, etc. We then obtain the following results (omitting the isomers):

CH2O2 — formic acid: boiling point 100° melting point 1°  
C2H4O2 — acetic acid: 118° melting point 17°  
C3H6O2 — propionic acid: 140° " "  
C8H8O2 — butyric acid: 162°  
C5H10O2 — valerianic acid: 175°  

and so on to C50H60O2, melissic acid, which melts only at 80° and has no boiling point at all, because it cannot evaporate without disintegrating.

Here therefore we have a whole series of qualitatively different bodies, formed by the simple quantitative addition of elements, and in fact always in the same proportion. This is most clearly evident in cases where the quantity of all the elements of the compound changes in the same proportion. Thus, in the normal paraffins CnH2n+2, the lowest is methane, CH4, a gas; the highest known, hexadecane, C16H34, is a solid body forming colourless crystals which melts at 21° and boils only at 278°. Each new member of both series comes into existence through the addition of CH2, one atom of carbon and two atoms of hydrogen, to the molecular formula of the preceding member, and this quantitative change in the molecular formula produces each time a qualitatively different body.

These series, however, are only one particularly obvious example; throughout practically the whole of chemistry, even in the various nitrogen oxides and oxygen acids of phosphorus or sulphur, one can see how “quantity changes into quality”, and this allegedly confused, hazy Hegelian notion appears in so to speak corporeal form in things and processes — and no one but Herr Dühring is confused and befogged by it. And if Marx was the first to call attention to it, and if Herr Dühring read the reference without even understanding it (otherwise he would certainly not have allowed this unparalleled outrage to pass unchallenged), this is enough — even without looking back at the famous Dühringian philosophy of nature — to make it clear which of the two, Marx or Herr Dühring, is lacking in “the eminently modern educative elements provided by the natural-scientific mode of thought” {D. K. G. 504} and in acquaintance with the “main achievements of ... chemistry” {D. Ph. 517}.

In conclusion we shall call one more witness for the transformation of quantity into quality, namely — Napoleon. He describes the combat between the French cavalry, who were bad riders but disciplined, and the Mamelukes, who were undoubtedly the best horsemen of their time for single combat, but lacked discipline, as follows:

“Two Mamelukes were undoubtedly more than a match for three Frenchmen; 100 Mamelukes were equal to 100 Frenchmen; 300 Frenchmen could generally beat 300 Mamelukes, and 1,000 Frenchmen invariably defeated 1,500 Mamelukes.”

Just as with Marx a definite, though varying, minimum sum of exchange-values was necessary to make possible its transformation into capital, so with Napoleon a detachment of cavalry had to be of a definite minimum number in order to make it possible for the force of discipline, embodied in closed order and planned utilisation, to manifest itself and rise superior even to greater numbers of irregular cavalry, in spite of the latter being better mounted, more dexterous horsemen and fighters, and at least as brave as the former. But what does this prove as against Herr Dühring? Was not Napoleon miserably vanquished in his conflict with Europe? Did he not suffer defeat after defeat? And why? Solely in consequence of having introduced the confused, hazy Hegelian notion into cavalry tactics!

### II  
[Dialectics]

---

In the meantime, along with and after the French philosophy of the 18th century, had arisen the new German philosophy, culminating in [Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#hegel).

Its greatest merit was the taking up again of dialectics as the highest form of reasoning. The old Greek philosophers were all born natural dialecticians, and Aristotle, the most encyclopaedic of them, had already analyzed the most essential forms of dialectic thought. The newer philosophy, on the other hand, although in it also dialectics had brilliant exponents (e.g. Descartes and Spinoza), had, especially through English influence, become more and more rigidly fixed in the so-called metaphysical mode of reasoning, by which also the French of the 18th century were almost wholly dominated, at all events in their special philosophical work. Outside philosophy in the restricted sense, the French nevertheless produced masterpieces of dialectic. We need only call to mind Diderot's _Le Neveu de Rameau_, and Rousseau's _Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'inegalite parmi les hommes_. We give here, in brief, the essential character of these two modes of thought.

When we consider and reflect upon Nature at large, or the history of mankind, or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of an endless entanglement of relations and reactions, permutations and combinations, in which nothing remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes away. We see, therefore, at first the picture as a whole, with its individual parts still more or less kept in the background; we observe the movements, transitions, connections, rather than the things that move, combine, and are connected. This primitive, naive but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by [Heraclitus](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#heraclitus): everything is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away.[[A]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm#A)

But this conception, correctly as it expresses the general character of the picture of appearances as a whole, does not suffice to explain the details of which this picture is made up, and so long as we do not understand these, we have not a clear idea of the whole picture. In order to understand these details, we must detach them from their natural, special causes, effects, etc. This is, primarily, the task of natural science and historical research: branches of science which the Greek of classical times, on very good grounds, relegated to a subordinate position, because they had first of all to collect materials for these sciences to work upon. A certain amount of natural and historical material must be collected before there can be any critical analysis, comparison, and arrangement in classes, orders, and species. The foundations of the exact natural sciences were, therefore, first worked out by the Greeks of the Alexandrian period [[B]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm#B), and later on, in the Middle Ages, by the Arabs. Real natural science dates from the second half of the 15th century, and thence onward it had advanced with constantly increasing rapidity. The analysis of Nature into its individual parts, the grouping of the different natural processes and objects in definite classes, the study of the internal anatomy of organized bodies in their manifold forms — these were the fundamental conditions of the gigantic strides in our knowledge of Nature that have been made during the last 400 years. But this method of work has also left us as legacy the habit of observing natural objects and processes in isolation, apart from their connection with the vast whole; of observing them in repose, not in motion; as constraints, not as essentially variables; in their death, not in their life. And when this way of looking at things was transferred by Bacon and Locke from natural science to philosophy, it begot the narrow, metaphysical mode of thought peculiar to the last century.

To the metaphysician, things and their mental reflexes, ideas, are isolated, are to be considered one after the other and apart from each other, are objects of investigation fixed, rigid, given once for all. He thinks in absolutely irreconcilable antitheses. His communication is 'yea, yea; nay, nay'; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." For him, a thing either exists or does not exist; a thing cannot at the same time be itself and something else. Positive and negative absolutely exclude one another; cause and effect stand in a rigid antithesis, one to the other.

At first sight, this mode of thinking seems to us very luminous, because it is that of so-called sound commonsense. Only sound commonsense, respectable fellow that he is, in the homely realm of his own four walls, has very wonderful adventures directly he ventures out into the wide world of research. And the metaphysical mode of thought, justifiable and necessary as it is in a number of domains whose extent varies according to the nature of the particular object of investigation, sooner or later reaches a limit, beyond which it becomes one-sided, restricted, abstract, lost in insoluble contradictions. In the contemplation of individual things, it forgets the connection between them; in the contemplation of their existence, it forgets the beginning and end of that existence; of their repose, it forgets their motion. It cannot see the woods for the trees.

For everyday purposes, we know and can say, e.g., whether an animal is alive or not. But, upon closer inquiry, we find that this is, in many cases, a very complex question, as the jurists know very well. They have cudgelled their brains in vain to discover a rational limit beyond which the killing of the child in its mother's womb is murder. It is just as impossible to determine absolutely the moment of death, for physiology proves that death is not an instantaneous, momentary phenomenon, but a very protracted process.

In like manner, every organized being is every moment the same and not the same; every moment, it assimilates matter supplied from without, and gets rid of other matter; every moment, some cells of its body die and others build themselves anew; in a longer or shorter time, the matter of its body is completely renewed, and is replaced by other molecules of matter, so that every organized being is always itself, and yet something other than itself.

Further, we find upon closer investigation that the two poles of an antithesis, positive and negative, e.g., are as inseparable as they are opposed, and that despite all their opposition, they mutually interpenetrate. And we find, in like manner, that cause and effect are conceptions which only hold good in their application to individual cases; but as soon as we consider the individual cases in their general connection with the universe as a whole, they run into each other, and they become confounded when we contemplate that universal action and reaction in which causes and effects are eternally changing places, so that what is effect here and now will be cause there and then, and vice versa.

None of these processes and modes of thought enters into the framework of metaphysical reasoning. Dialectics, on the other hand, comprehends things and their representations, ideas, in their essential connection, concatenation, motion, origin and ending. Such processes as those mentioned above are, therefore, so many corroborations of its own method of procedure.

Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly daily, and thus has shown that, in the last resort, Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically; that she does not move in the eternal oneness of a perpetually recurring circle, but goes through a real historical evolution. In this connection, Darwin must be named before all others. He dealt the metaphysical conception of Nature the heaviest blow by his proof that all organic beings, plants, animals, and man himself, are the products of a process of evolution going on through millions of years. But, the naturalists, who have learned to think dialectically, are few and far between, and this conflict of the results of discovery with preconceived modes of thinking, explains the endless confusion now reigning in theoretical natural science, the despair of teachers as well as learners, of authors and readers alike.

An exact representation of the universe, of its evolution, of the development of mankind, and of the reflection of this evolution in the minds of men, can therefore only be obtained by the methods of dialectics with its constant regard to the innumerable actions and reactions of life and death, of progressive or retrogressive changes. And in this spirit, the new German philosophy has worked. Kant began his career by resolving the stable Solar system of Newton and its eternal duration, after the famous initial impulse had once been given, into the result of a historical process, the formation of the Sun and all the planets out of a rotating, nebulous mass. From this, he at the same time drew the conclusion that, given this origin of the Solar system, its future death followed of necessity. His theory, half a century later, was established mathematically by Laplace, and half a century after that, the spectroscope proved the existence in space of such incandescent masses of gas in various stages of condensation.

![Picture of Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/pics/hegel.gif)This new German philosophy culminated in the Hegelian system. In this system — and herein is its great merit — for the first time the whole world, natural, historical, intellectual, is represented as a process — i.e., as in constant motion, change, transformation, development; and the attempt is made to trace out the internal connection that makes a continuous whole of all this movement and development. From this point of view, the history of mankind no longer appeared as a wild whirl of senseless deeds of violence, all equally condemnable at the judgment seat of mature philosophic reason and which are best forgotten as quickly as possible, but as the process of evolution of man himself. It was now the task of the intellect to follow the gradual march of this process through all its devious ways, and to trace out the inner law running through all its apparently accidental phenomena.

That the Hegelian system did not solve the problem it propounded is here immaterial. Its epoch-making merit was that it propounded the problem. This problem is one that no single individual will ever be able to solve. Although Hegel was — with Saint-Simon — the most encyclopaedic mind of his time, yet he was limited, first, by the necessary limited extent of his own knowledge and, second, by the limited extent and depth of the knowledge and conceptions of his age. To these limits, a third must be added; Hegel was an idealist. To him, the thoughts within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual things and processes, but, conversely, things and their evolution were only the realized pictures of the "Idea", existing somewhere from eternity before the world was. This way of thinking turned everything upside down, and completely reversed the actual connection of things in the world. Correctly and ingeniously as many groups of facts were grasped by Hegel, yet, for the reasons just given, there is much that is botched, artificial, labored, in a word, wrong in point of detail. The Hegelian system, in itself, was a colossal miscarriage — but it was also the last of its kind.

It was suffering, in fact, from an internal and incurable contradiction. Upon the one hand, its essential proposition was the conception that human history is a process of evolution, which, by its very nature, cannot find its intellectual final term in the discovery of any so-called absolute truth. But, on the other hand, it laid claim to being the very essence of this absolute truth. A system of natural and historical knowledge, embracing everything, and final for all time, is a contradiction to the fundamental law of dialectic reasoning.

This law, indeed, by no means excludes, but, on the contrary, includes the idea that the systematic knowledge of the external universe can make giant strides from age to age.

The perception of the the fundamental contradiction in German idealism led necessarily back to materialism, but — _nota bene_ — not to the simply metaphysical, exclusively mechanical materialism of the 18th century. Old materialism looked upon all previous history as a crude heap of irrationality and violence; modern materialism sees in it the process of evolution of humanity, and aims at discovering the laws thereof. With the French of the 18th century, and even with Hegel, the conception obtained of Nature as a whole — moving in narrow circles, and forever immutable, with its eternal celestial bodies, as Newton, and unalterable organic species, as Linnaeus, taught. Modern materialism embraces the more recent discoveries of natural science, according to which Nature also has its history in time, the celestial bodies, like the organic species that, under favorable conditions, people them, being born and perishing. And even if Nature, as a whole, must still be said to move in recurrent cycles, these cycles assume infinitely larger dimensions. In both aspects, modern materialism is essentially dialectic, and no longer requires the assistance of that sort of philosophy which, queen-like, pretended to rule the remaining mob of sciences. As soon as each special science is bound to make clear its position in the great totality of things and of our knowledge of things, a special science dealing with this totality is superfluous or unnecessary. That which still survives of all earlier philosophy is the science of thought and its law — formal logic and dialectics. Everything else is subsumed in the positive science of Nature and history.

Whilst, however, the revolution in the conception of Nature could only be made in proportion to the corresponding positive materials furnished by research, already much earlier certain historical facts had occurred which led to a decisive change in the conception of history. In 1831, the first working-class rising took place in Lyons; between 1838 and 1842, the first national working-class movement, that of the [English Chartists](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/c/h.htm#chartists), reached its height. The class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie came to the front in the history of the most advanced countries in Europe, in proportion to the development, upon the one hand, of modern industry, upon the other, of the newly-acquired political supremacy of the bourgeoisie. Facts more and more strenuously gave the lie to the teachings of bourgeois economy as to the identity of the interests of capital and labor, as to the universal harmony and universal prosperity that would be the consequence of unbridled competition. All these things could no longer be ignored, any more than the French and English Socialism, which was their theoretical, though very imperfect, expression. But the old idealist conception of history, which was not yet dislodged, knew nothing of class struggles based upon economic interests, knew nothing of economic interests; production and all economic relations appeared in it only as incidental, subordinate elements in the "history of civilization".

The new facts made imperative a new examination of all past history. Then it was seen that _all_ past history, with the exception of its primitive stages, was the history of class struggles; that these warring classes of society are always the products of the modes of production and of exchange — in a word, of the _economic_ conditions of their time; that the economic structure of society always furnishes the real basis, starting from which we can alone work out the ultimate explanation of the whole superstructure of juridical and political institutions as well as of the religious, philosophical, and other ideas of a given historical period. Hegel has freed history from metaphysics — he made it dialectic; but his conception of history was essentially idealistic. But now idealism was driven from its last refuge, the philosophy of history; now a materialistic treatment of history was propounded, and a method found of explaining man's "knowing" by his "being", instead of, as heretofore, his "being" by his "knowing".

From that time forward, Socialism was no longer an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes — the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historico-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung, and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict. But the Socialism of earlier days was as incompatible with this materialist conception as the conception of Nature of the French materialists was with dialectics and modern natural science. The Socialism of earlier days certainly criticized the existing capitalistic mode of production and its consequences. But it could not explain them, and, therefore, could not get the mastery of them. It could only simply reject them as bad. The more strongly this earlier Socialism denounced the exploitations of the working-class, inevitable under Capitalism, the less able was it clearly to show in what this exploitation consisted and how it arose, but for this it was necessary —

to present the capitalistic mode of production in its historical connection and its inevitableness during a particular historical period, and therefore, also, to present its inevitable downfall; and

to lay bare its essential character, which was still a secret. This was done by the discovery of _surplus-value_.

It was shown that the appropriation of unpaid labor is the basis of the capitalist mode of production and of the exploitation of the worker that occurs under it; that even if the capitalist buys the labor power of his laborer at its full value as a commodity on the market, he yet extracts more value from it than he paid for; and that in the ultimate analysis, this surplus-value forms those sums of value from which are heaped up constantly increasing masses of capital in the hands of the possessing classes. The genesis of capitalist production and the production of capital were both explained.

These two great discoveries, the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value, we owe to Marx. With these discoveries, Socialism became a science. The next thing was to work out all its details and relations.

# **Dialectics, Complexity and the Crisis**

by Michael Brand

Much about current political life is hardly encouraging. They can call it the New World Order if they want to, but the collapse of the USSR, the growth of right wing militias in the U.S., the transformation several years ago of "Operation Hope" into military conflict in Somalia and the more recent carnage in former Yugoslavia are all prominent examples of the chaotic character of the moment. The formerly stable is crumbling and everywhere things appear to be getting worse. Unemployment, violence and poverty are all increasing. No solution appears forthcoming from those in power or their loyal opposition. The abruptness of change, the radical rupture with the past, is everywhere. Many scientists, especially those involved in progressive political activity, are trying to find meaning in the current chaos. How should they understand the crisis? The continuous, incremental perspective on development, however useful it may be to describe gradual development, does not apply here. Yet, this is the perspective on how change occurs which has dominated much of social and natural science until recently.

Meanwhile, a revolution is sweeping all areas of modern science. Its source is electronic. Everywhere, the computational capability of computers is providing access to previously unavailable quantities of information. As a result, patterns of development of diverse processes are becoming known. The most recent expression of the new discoveries is the so-called "new science" of complexity. It finds common patterns of motion among quite different processes known as complex dynamic systems.

## Complexity

Complexity is a clear assertion that development is not exclusively or, even, mainly continuous. It is a rebuttal, or, perhaps, an extension of the classic, gradual view of development characterized by Newton or Darwin. In fact, evolution is one of the main subjects where there has been a recognition that development occurs in leaps which punctuate periods of gradual growth. The rapid emergence of multicellular life forms in the so-called Cambrian explosion some 600 millions years ago contradicts the formerly held assumptions of gradualism postulated by Darwin. These discoveries, popularized by Stephen Jay Gould (Gould, 1989), could be accomplished because of the availability of electronic reconstruction processes as well as the creativity of the discoverers. The resulting debate about the dynamic of evolution, the role of natural selection, and the existence of pre-established limits or attractors to complex evolutionary systems continues.

A similar issue regarding attractors can be posed about society. Is history just "one damn thing after another", as Churchill put it, or are there definite indispensable phases through which it must pass? Are there attractors in the complex dynamic process of human society? Were, say, large scale factory production or the social formations corresponding to it inevitable? Are exploitation and poverty inevitable? Is it at least possible to overcome them? Complexity provides a scientific framework within which to raise such questions.

Complexity makes extremely general claims about development, the emergence of new things from old, etc. At least some of its advocates and detractors discuss it in terms of a search for a "theory of everything". As such, it is met with studied scepticism and opposition by portions of the scientific community (Horgan, 1995). Nonetheless, complexity is a philosophic framework with substantial precedent in the computer age. Chaos Theory, Catastrophe Theory and Fractal Geometry all are theoretical perspectives which have emerged within the past twenty or so years which view development as emergent, discontinuous or abrupt. They all, to some extent, anticipate complexity.

The significance of complexity does not rest with any particular discovery or hypothesis. The value of complexity is that of a general philosophic outlook which attempts to capture the insights which modern electronics is revealing about nature and society. The dependence of its subject matter on electronic technology is acknowledged in the following passage which also indicates the breadth of application of the underlying concepts:

> Fractals and modern chaos theory are also linked by the fact that many of the contemporary pace setting discoveries in their fields were only possible using computers....''(I)t is already clear that the history of the sciences has been enriched by an indispensable chapter. Only superficially is the issue one of beautiful pictures or of perils of deterministic laws. In essence, chaos theory and fractal geometry radically question our understanding of equilibria - and therefore of harmony and order - in nature as well as in other contexts and offer a new and holistic model which can encompass an edge of the true complexity of nature for the first time. It is highly probable that the new methods and terminologies will allow us, for example, a much more adequate understanding of ecology and climatic developments, and thus they could contribute to our more effectively tackling our gigantic global problems.'' (Pietgen, Jurgens, Saupe.1992).

Complexity proposes a view of the continuity/discontinuity of development in numerous contexts. The general pattern its adherents describe includes: -the emergence of global structure from local, simple interactions;

- the inter-connection of phenomena; -the continuous linear development of a process to the point of maximum information processing capability, where it remains poised at the so-called "edge of chaos" until further information enters the system, disrupts stability and ushers in a leap to a new situation;
- the emergence of global order and structure via chaotic, random activity; the existence of limits or end results of dynamic processes known as attractors.

Information processing capability is a variable which complexity theorists use to measure the degree of development of complex adaptive systems. As systems evolve, information processing grows gradually to a point, the so-called "edge of chaos", where stability is challenged by further information: "The edge of chaos is where information gets its foot in the door in the physical world, where it gets the upper hand over energy" (C. Langdon in Lewin, 1992, p. 51). This concept arose from generalizing computer simulations (of consciousness development, species evolution and other phenomena). It plays an important role in the perspective on change of complexity. It provides a useful interpretation for the development of society.

The areas of applicability of complexity are extremely diverse. Physicist Per Bak of the Brookhaven National Laboratory notes earthquake distributions, stock market fluctuations, and species extinction patterns among the phenomena that display similar general patterns corresponding to complexity theory. Also included are the artificial intelligence models of Sante Fe Institute member Chris Langdon, the Boolean networks of University of Pennsylvania biologist Stuart Kauffman and the interpretations of both biological and cultural evolution by Nobel laureate Murray Gell-man.

Human society is the most obvious example of a complex adaptive system. It is obviously both complex and adaptive. It has reorganized itself throughout history to facilitate its capability to process information for social purposes. For example, the transition from feudal, principally rural social forms to capitalist, principally urban ones allowed for the eventual application of science to industry during the 18th and 19th centuries. The process was anything but orderly and peaceful. On the contrary, the forcible removal of the agricultural population from the land, their means of subsistence, was disorderly, violent and often bloody. The enclosure of lands formerly used in common simultaneously transformed the land into sheep-walks and the population into an urban working class. Then, social disorganization prepared society for social reorganization. Does the present disarray have a similar content?

The relation between chaos and structure is a central issue for the "new science" which has immediate social application. Does the development of societies proceed to their maximum information processing capability at the so-called "edge of chaos"? Does further excitation there give rise to a chaotic transition to a new state of higher information processing capability (higher complexity)? This description is fully consistent with the evolutionary perspective of complexity theory. It is also a view of the present period as a prelude, or, at least a possible prelude, to a more cooperative, more conscious social order. The proof, of course, will be in the pudding. The point is only that the conclusions of modern complexity are consistent with an optimistic understanding of current events, in spite of the images and reality of "chaos".

Complexity provides a philosophic framework for analyzing the current crisis. Chris Langdon, one of the discoverers of the concept of "the edge of chaos" sees complexity-like patterns in the current situation. Commenting on the likely effects of the decline of the USSR in October 1991, he refers to a computer based evolution model: "You can see these two species coexisting in a long period of stability; then one of them drops out and all hell breaks loose. Tremendous instability. That's the Soviet Union" he'd said, pointing to the species that dropped out. "I'm no fan of the Cold War, but my bet is that we're going to see a lot of instability in the real world now that it's over. That is, if these models of ours have any validity at all" (quoted in Lewin, 1992). To take this important insight further, a concrete investigation of current social motion is needed. For the rich potential of complexity to be utilized to understand current social development requires more than the recognition of a common "complex" pattern shared with other complex adaptive systems. The devil is in the details. To really evaluate what is going on, it is necessary to identify what it is that gives the present its character and direction. The actual basis for the dynamics of social development must be disclosed and analyzed.

This has not taken place among the adherents of complexity. There are archaeological analyses of the stages of development of ancient societies as exhibiting "... attractors equivalent to discrete levels of organization, like the tribe, the chiefdom, the state" (Lewin, 1992, p. 21). But, as far as application to the current social crisis, complexity theorists have little to say. What analysis of the present that is being done deals with discrete issues. Stock market equilibrium or lack thereof, comparative advantage of particular commodities, foreign trade balances among others have all been investigated from the standpoint of complexity. They are dealt with as isolates even though the approach of complexity emphasizes the interconnection of phenomena.

Significantly, the implied context of this work has been the assumed permanence of the capitalist form of social organization. Yet, the basic principles of complexity include the recognition that the edge of chaos is a place where qualitative distinctness can emerge. This possibility is simply overlooked. Why are these basic tenets disregarded in favor of such conservative assumptions? Do the interests of the corporate sponsors of much complexity research prejudice investigation? Most important, how can these limitations be overcome? How can the insights of complexity be made available for an analysis of the current crisis?

For the philosophic outlook of complexity to be applied to such efforts it is helpful, maybe even necessary, to regard complexity in relation to its historical antecedents. Both as a philosophic methodology and in its application to social analysis, the dialectical materialism associated with Karl Marx and Frederick Engels is an appropriate predecessor. This connection is demonstrable. The patterns and principles of development that comprise complexity are generalizations of structures which are accessible to analysis via electronics. They are also fully consistent applications of dialectics. It is not that complexity represents nothing new. As science progresses so does philosophy. The point isn't to choose the 'right' term or a philosophic outlook and methodology, "Is it dialectics or is it complexity?". Rather, it is to recognize a real and useful connection in the history of science and philosophy. The connection is important for two reasons: (i) It allows the projections of Marxism to be evaluated in the context of modern science; and (ii) it demystifies complexity by connecting it to past accomplishments.

## Complexity and Dialectical Materialism

Materialism is the acknowledgement that the world is real and knowable, that its existence does not stand in need of any "other worldly" act of creation nor require the existence of any "ideal" source for its maintenance. In so far as its methodology and assumptions are concerned, modern science, in general, accepts the outlook of materialism. It is worth pointing out that, as Galileo's case bears witness, this has not always been the case nor is it unconditionally the accepted standard currently. Roger Lewin discusses two contemporary non-materialist views of the failure of science to fully explain human consciousness. Not surprisingly, one invokes " a supernatural spiritual creation", "a miracle forever beyond science" and the other asserts materialism but contends that the truth of the issue is ultimately unknowable (Lewin, 1992 p. 154, 167). Still, materialist views are world-wide and ancient. A pre-Socratic summation by Heraclitus imaginatively summarizes the concept: "This order of things, the same for all, was not made by any god nor any man, but was and is and will be for ever, a living fire, kindled by measure and quenched by measure" (Leningrad Institute of Philosophy, 1937).

Now for dialectics. Dialectical philosophy aspires to generalize the way that things change and develop. It acknowledges that things do not change in isolation from each other but in their inter-connection with each other. As Frederick Engels put it, dialectics is "the science of interconnections" (Engels, 1972, p. 62). Dialectics itself changes or, at least, our understanding of it does. As advances in science, including social science, disclose the patterns and connections among things that allow them to develop, dialectical philosophy is correspondingly developed.

Dialectical materialism is a useful philosophic orientation which is not generally well known. We recommend two excellent, very different, modern discussions of dialectics in _The Dialectical Biologist_ by Levins and Lewontin and in _Entering an Era of Social Revolution_ by Peery. Levins and Lewontin's presentation of dialectics emphasizes natural science. Peery mainly applies dialectics to social transformation. From the standpoint of dialectical philosophy, he analyzes the possibility of the emergence of a qualitatively new, cooperative society from the current situation. Each discussion contains insights which rest upon those of traditional dialectics; each deepens them by consideration of modern information. Levins and Lewontin indicate the historical character of dialectics when they acknowledge their indebtedness to Engels, to whom they dedicate their book, while recognizing the nineteenth century limitations of his scientific perspective (Levins and Lewontin p. 279). We refer the reader to either source for information about dialectics as such. Our interest here is the development of dialectics in its relation to complexity.

Complexity studies (among other things) the relation between order and chaos and the emergence of structure from random processes. Random individual outcomes often comprise the content of deterministic patterns. Thus, many processes have a global structure which emerges from individual randomness (Ask any poker player!). This inter-connection between the apparent mutually isolated categories, "random" and "deterministic" is the basis for much of the theory of probability and statistics. Its philosophic generality was noted by Engels more than a century ago as "...the necessity that is also inherent in chance." It is discussed as an example of dialectics by Levins and Lewontin: "(R)andom processes may have deterministic results. This is the basis for predictions about the number of traffic accidents or for actuarial tables. A random process results in some frequency distribution of outcomes...(T)he distribution as an object of study is deterministic even though it is the product of random events" (p. 284).

What is new which complexity considers are the numerous examples which electronic computers reveal of determinist outcomes that are now known to evolve from random processes. From "artificial intelligence" or species evolution models to mathematical fractals, quite complex deterministic structures can be shown to emerge from random processes. Complexity theory examines such emergence as a general principle. A debate, with important social implications regarding the nature of human progress, is ensuing among scientists about under what circumstances the eventual outcome (the limit or attractor) of a complex process can be said to exist.

What is also new and most significant are the cases in which random and/or initially tiny changes in complex dynamic systems disrupt the expected, determined outcome. The unstable situation in which small changes in a process initiate a chaotic leap to a qualitatively new process is being revealed as a discontinuous aspect of development in nature and society. Perhaps the best known example of discontinuity under appropriate conditions is the so-called Butterfly Effect named after an article by the physicist E. Lorenz: "Can the Flap of a butterfly's wing stir up a tornado in Texas?" (Answer: Sometimes, but not often). In this example and significant others, discontinuity and leaps to new states of being are revealed as an essential aspect of real motion. This recognition has a history within dialectics. It is of tremendous importance to any attempt to uncover the causes of the current social disintegration and where it might be headed.

The conception of development through leaps has always been part of dialectics. Engels discussed "...the Hegelian nodal line of measure relations, in which, at certain definite nodal points, the purely quantitative increase or decrease gives rise to a qualitative leap..." In many particular cases, however, sufficient information about the actual emergence of the new from the old often was not accessible. Electronics has changed this situation. The introduction of electronics into the social and scientific environments is both causing qualitative changes and making them more visible. Thus, it is becoming possible to more deeply describe the emergence of the qualitatively new.

One such description is the concept in complexity theory of "the edge of chaos" originated by Chris Langdon and Norman Packard. Their main area of application has been in the physical sciences. Another is the dialectical assertion by Nelson Peery that qualitative leaps begin with the introduction of an aspect of the new process into the quantitative development of the old process. His main application is to current social development. He identifies electronic technology as both disrupting the nexus that binds together the capitalist class and the working class, and providing the technical basis for post-capitalist society (see below). These two conceptions are similar, although not identical. They both attempt to account for the emergence of new phenomena. They each identify a process wherein, at a certain stage of development, the introduction of further change topples the existing stability and ushers in a chaotic period leading to qualitative change. They are mutually consistent criteria for the occurrence of qualitative leaps. They demonstrate the connection between Complexity and Marxist dialectics.

## Capitalism as a Complex Dynamic System

The most prominent application of dialectical materialism remains its use by Marx and Engels in analyzing how capitalist society works. It is a precursor to the approach of complexity which contains important theoretical conclusions that bear upon the present. Marx focuses on the simple exchange of commodities as the source of the development of capitalist society as a whole (Marx, 1973). From examination of this process, the Law of Value and, then, numerous other economic principles are derived. It is a useful example of the emergence of a complex adaptive system from local interaction which characterizes complexity. It indicates the deep historical connection between complexity and Marxist dialectics. It is a valid starting point for applying the methodology of complexity and/or dialectics to analyze the current situation.

We proceed from Marx's recognition that capital is a social relation. It is not a dead thing. It is not machinery or land or whatever. Capital is a living relation among social classes. "Capital is a collective product...it is a social power" (Marx, 1982), a power which the capitalist class exerts over the working class. It arises from the exchange of commodities between the capitalist class and the working class. The only thing that the working class has to sell is its capacity to work, what Marx termed its labor power.

The capitalist class purchases labor power from the working class and sells them necessaries of life. Whatever each thinks of the other, during the period of growth of capitalism, they are bound together. They need each other. They are defined by each other through mutual exchange. As Marx showed in detail (Marx, 1967), the proportion in which this exchange occurs is regulated by the law of value, the same economic law that determines the exchange ratio between any other commodities.

Economic activity in capitalist society consists of the production and exchange of millions of individual commodities. The buyer needs the seller in order to buy and vice versa. Individual buyers try to buy low and individual sellers try to sell high. The Law of Value describes the general outcome of this struggle between contradictory economic interests. It assigns exchange value to individual commodities according to the quantity of labor necessary for their production. The relative value of commodities thus is determined by the relative quantities of labor required to produce them. The law of value asserts that, ultimately, the ratio in which commodities tend to exchange is determined by the proportion between their labor contents. Since exchange of commodities generally occurs through exchange of money, price becomes a form of expression of value. Thus, as the labor required to produce any given commodity falls (or rises), its price tends to do so as well.

Numerous empirical confirmations of this phenomenon are available from the past two centuries during which it has regulated the economic life of capitalist societies. For example, the cotton gin, by automating the removal of seeds and hulls from the cotton plant, lowered the quantity of labor necessary for cotton production. Thus, cotton could be economically produced, giving rise simultaneously to the ante-bellum slave system in the U.S. and the textile industry in Europe. After the Civil War, sharecropping, a form of virtually involuntary labor, replaced slavery. It was only the invention of an automatic cotton picker after W.W.II that undercut the value of manual labor power in cotton production.

Presently, it remains true that the more technology that is applied to the production of a commodity, (i.e. the less labor that is required), the lower the price tends to be. How this tendency manifests itself in particular cases varies, but the general direction is observable. For example, to be affordable to a mass market, the early automobiles required labor saving assembly line methods of production (Rifkin, 1995, p. 95).

Similarly, modern personal computers, VCRs, etc. could only be sold in massive quantities when electronics reduced the quantity of labor required to produce them. The less the labor, the less the cost - for cars, for PC's and, ultimately, for any commodity. In particular, for labor power. The cost of the labor power necessary for capitalist production is rapidly diminishing with drastic consequences for the workers of the world.

Prior to the advent of electronic technology, labor productivity (which grows inversely with the value of labor power) grew quantitatively. Manual labor, steam power, internal combustion and electricity mark some definitive stages of this development. Capitalism's expansion and the expansion of its market were a requirement for this process. It did expand. The colonial system, the Great Depression, W.W.II, the rebuilding of the war-torn (capitalist) countries and the dismantling of the direct colonies after the war were all dramatic events that permitted such expansion to occur. As they indicate, the process was not smooth and was often painful. But its essential content was the development of world capitalism through stages of growth. The capitalist system, itself, (see T. Hirschl's essay) was never seriously in danger.

As argued elsewhere in this volume as well as in Jeremy Rifkin's The End of Work, electronics is labor-eliminating. But can there be capitalism without labor? Labor is both the source of the survival of the working class and the enrichment of the capitalist class. Electronic production cheapens the value of the workers' labor power to the point where the operation of the law of value cannot sustain the relation between the capitalist class and the working class. The amount of labor required for profitable production can neither support the existence of the workers nor the productive investment of the capitalists. The connection between them is being torn asunder. A new class is emerging which can neither work nor consume. Social stability based on the availability of work is a thing of the past.

Note again the consistency of this analysis both with the approach of complexity and of dialectics. Society is poised at the "edge of chaos", with its information processing capability maximized when a qualitatively new element, electronic information processing, is introduced. Then, all hell breaks loose. Where do we go from here?

## Conclusion

Society is not merely poised at the edge of chaos. Electronic technology is both labor-free and productive beyond the bounds of human necessity. Thus, the same source that disrupts the stability of capitalist society could liberate human society from its historic and, apparently, endemic scarcity and exploitation. The earliest projection of such human liberation on the basis of the negation of labor was by Marx:

> "In all revolutions up till now the mode of activity always remained unscathed and it was always a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labor to other persons, whilst the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labor, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves...." (Marx and Engels, 1976).

The interpretation of a cooperative, post-scarcity society based upon electronic production as an attractor for human society is consistent with Marx's formulation. So too is Peery's dialectical understanding of post-scarcity society emerging from the introduction of electronic production into capitalist society. Of course we cannot guarantee the future. We are only pointing out the consistency of the projection of a plentiful, cooperative, communist society with the perspectives of complexity and of dialectics. Science can only indicate what is possible. What will happen will be determined by what people do.

### 5 - Ancient Logic and Dialectics

Before I go further, I should like to give a few more biographical facts concerning Plato and Aristotle. Plato was born in Athens in 429 B.C., and came from a distinguished aristocratic family. His main works are put in the form of dialogues or conversations. He was a student of Socrates. Aristotle, in his turn, was a student of Plato.He was born in 384 B.C. He was not a native Athenian, but he lived the greater part of his life in Athens and there set up his own school of philosophy. Aristotle was the teacher of Alexander the Great, the son of Philip of Macedonia. He left many voluminous writings. Not only was he the greatest philosopher of Greek antiquity, but he was also a great natural scientist and the founder of a whole range of sciences. Aristotle was ascientific genius of the first rank, the greatest mind in all antiquity. His influence on the subsequent period was sogreat that we can say that two thousand years, until the beginning of modern times, were under his sway.

We previously stressed the reactionary role of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. Now we shall speak of its great progressive role. This resides in the fact that the ruling classes of Athens at that time believed the aim of the exploitation of slave labor and their class rule to be the free development of human capacities, above all, the development of reason. This is closely connected with the fact that this slave production was not ultimately and predominantly commodity production, not production for the sake of surplus value like capitalist production. Its chief aim was production for individual use, production of use values. From this it followed that the ruling class was not absorbed in business or industry, but conceived its ideal to be the development of art and of science. Thus arose the extraordinary great interest in the investigation of human reason, in the discovery of the laws of thought. Through this activity the Greeks created a new epoch in the general development of history. As represented by Aristotle they built up the doctrine of the forms and laws of thought, known as formal logic. They also laid the foundation for what is called dialectics. Wherein dialectics and formal logic differ, we shall soon see. The science of the laws of thought, formal logic, reached its highest point with Aristotle. It was here developed so broadly and fully that it was not until the beginning of the 19th century that the German philosopher, Hegel, could make a significant and decisive advance over it.

I will now briefly explain what formal logic is and how it differs from dialectics. Formal logic can be defined as the theory of the laws of thought without regard to the content of thought. The theory of thinking or logic describes how concepts are built and wherein the different concepts differ from each other in regard to form. It deals with the different kinds of propositions and, ultimately, with the different kinds and forms of inferences, of syllogisms. Logic seeks to teach how to think correctly.

Ordinarily man thinks about nature without having need for any special art of thinking. This generally suffices for everyday life. But as soon as relations and things become more difficult, as soon as man concerns himself with conclusions drawn from a great number of premises, as soon as he becomes involved in long abstract processes of thought, then the possibility of error grows, and it becomes necessary to control and to ascertain the correctness of thought. Therefore logic has a far-reaching significance for science.

The laws of logic are based on two main propositions. The first is that of identity or of self-conformity. The proposition very simply states: "A is A," that is, every concept is equal to itself. A man is a man; a hen is a hen; a potato is a potato. This proposition forms one basis of logic. The second main proposition is the law of contradiction, or as it is also called, the law of the excluded middle. This proposition states: "A is either A or _not_ A." It cannot be both at the same time. For example: Whatever is black is black; it cannot at the same time be black and white. A thing - to put it in general terms - cannot at the same time be itself and its opposite. In practice it therefore follows that if I draw certain conclusions from a given starting point and contradictions arise, then there are errors in thinking or my starting point was wrong. If from some correct premises I come to the conclusion that 4 is the same as 5, then I deduce from the law of contradiction that my conclusion is false.

So far all appears to be clear and certain. What can be a clearer law than that man is man, a rooster a rooster, that a thing is always the same thing? It even appears to be absolutely certain that a thing is either large or small; either black or white, that it cannot be both at the same time, that contradictions cannot exist in one and the same thing.

Let us now consider the matter from the standpoint of a higher doctrine of thought, from the standpoint of dialectics. Let us take the first law which we have developed as the foundation of logic: A is A. A thing is always the same thing. Without testing this law, let us consider another one which we have already mentioned, the law of Heraclitus which says "Everything is in flux," or "One cannot ascend the same river twice." Can we say that the river is always the same? No, the law of Heraclitus says the opposite. The river is at no moment the same. It is always changing. Thus one cannot twice nor, more exactly, even once ascend the same river. In short: the law "A is A" in the last analysis is valid only if I assume that the thing does not change. As soon as I consider the thing in its change, then A is always A and something else; A is at the same time not-A. And this in the last analysis holds for all things and events. Moreover, the seemingly changeless is established by science as changeful. One takes as a symbol of changelessness, for example, rocks or great mountains. But these rocks, as the history of geography shows, come into being and pass away; the changes, however, take so long in relation to the span of man's life that man does not notice them without special study. They are eroded by wind and by moisture; under the influence of heat and cold they are in motion. These are changes which occur so slowly that their process cannot be seen with the eye. They become visible only after long intervals. Or let us take plants. Plants change, grow. This cannot be seen with the naked eye either. It is today possible to see how a plant grows by means of moving pictures. We knew today that various kinds plants have charged. We know, for example, that wheat, rye, and rice were not always what they are today and that these plants have developed from simpler ones. This also applies to all types of animals and to human beings. Perhaps the planetary system and the sun are permanent and changeless? But astronomy teaches us that this planetary system must have emerged and that it must again ultimately disappear. Thus even here there is change, unceasing, boundless change. Man had long believed - until very recent times - that the primordial matter to which all things could be reduced, the chemical elements, were changeless, that this primordial matter was the one thing that did not change. Today it is known that this also is not the case. Elements are known - radium, etc. - which change. We suspect that all matter has emerged from still simpler parts, from electrons, that under certain conditions of temperature and pressure they became integrated and that they will eventually disintegrate and be transformed. When we know this, now does the famous fundamental law of logic stand up - the law that, "A thing is always the same"? Evidently this law is in least not unconditionally correct. It has only a _limited significance._ It is only valid for certain limited periods of time, or in abstraction; that is, when I ignore the changes of a thing and consider it for the moment as invariable. When I thus control a thing, making it invariable and changeless for a certain length of time, I can operate without falling into great error. But if I generalize and propound without qualifications I fall into grave errors. Then this law of formal logic does not hold good. I must turn to a higher system, to dialectics; that is, I say that difference is bound up with all identity. Thus in no object can I absolutely separate identity and difference. The object remains the same, and at the same time it changes. Both attributes exist at the same time.

A modern bourgeois philosopher, the Frenchman, Bergson, fell into the error of overlooking the _identity_ in universal change, and came to the conclusion that the true nature of all things is unknowable since the understanding can only work with fixed, changeless concepts. Here the error committed is the reverse of the assumption that the law of the self-conformity of things is exclusively and unconditionally valid. If I extend the change between two states of a thing so far that _no_ identity _at all_ remains between them, then I cannot establish any change. I am utterly unable to say that they represent two states of one thing. To establish change I need a single common reference. The _quantitative_ difference between two things or two states of one thing is only possible to determine when I can consider them in some way alike. If there is no identity without difference, it is also true that there is no difference without identity.

Let us now examine the second basic law of thought, the law of contradiction. According to this law a thing cannot at the same time be itself and its opposite. A figure is either round or angular; a line is either straight or curved. If we consider what we previously discovered regarding the law of identity, we see that not only is contradiction not impossible, but that everything that changes must at every moment represent a contradiction. We have already said that a thing which changes is identical with itself and is different from itself. It is identical and different; identical and not identical. Within the same thing there exists a contradiction. And this law holds generally for all things which change - all things which are identical and not identical, the same and not the same. Let us apply, this, for example, to the proposition: "A line is either straight or curved." What do the mathematicians say? They consider the smallest part of a circle as straight. Within certain limits they make straight and curved identical. This allows much more precise and certain calculations than if one absolutely separates straight and curved. A figure is either round or angular, but mathematicians consider a circle as a figure with an infinite number of angles. In this relation they thus make round and angular identical, and an entire section of mathematics is built upon this basic law which is full of contradictions.

In place of the law of contradiction which simple, traditional logic sets up, we can set up the opposite law, the law that everything contains a contradiction within itself, is composed of opposites. We have already verified this in the concept of change which obtains for all things. We have still to verify it in connection with certain propositions of the ancient Greeks, the concept of _locomotion_, for example. The Eleatic philosophers showed that all locomotion represents a contradiction and is therefore impossible. They concluded, therefore, that there is no actual motion, that motion is an illusion. And they proved this with two famous examples. The first is the proposition of the arrow, the other is the proposition of Achilles and the tortoise. The proposition of the arrow runs thus: It is asserted that if I shoot an arrow from a point, it never can reach a distant point. For if I shoot an arrow from a point which I designate A, and this arrow should reach point B, then it is certain that it must have previously traversed the intervening space. From A it must have reached C. Further, it is certain that still before that it must have covered half the distance A-C, that is, it must have travelled from A to D. If it was to reach D, it must have previously traversed half that distance, that is, to F. One can continue this division to infinity. The arrow must always have attained a previous point and thus _ad infinitum._ It consequently can never depart from A, since the number of distances is infinitely large. In a finite time it cannot go from A to B. Consequently motion is impossible.

Perhaps even clearer is the example of Achilles and the tortoise. Achilles was reputed to be the most swift-footed of the Greeks. The tortoise is a slow-moving animal. Yet if the tortoise has any head start at all, Achilles can never catch up with the tortoise. Let us say that the tortoise has a head start of a hundred yards. In one second Achilles runs ten yards, the tortoise one yard. What will be the outcome? While Achilles covers a distance of one hundred yards which separates him from the tortoise, the tortoise goes ten yards farther. While Achilles runs these ten yards which still separate him from the tortoise, the tortoise goes one yard farther. While Achilles runs the one yard, the tortoise goes one tenth of a yard, and so on _ad infinitum._ There always remains a certain distance between them. While Achilles runs through this distance, the tortoise each time covers a distance one-tenth as great. It therefore follows that Achilles will never catch up with the tortoise.

These two stories are of course not merely jokes; there is a deeper meaning within them. In both cases it is demonstrated that a certain finite distance can be infinitely divided and _for this very reason_ it follows that a finite distance cannot be put together out of infinite) many parts; it follows, in other words, that a finite distance cannot consist of infinite parts. Now in notion it is demonstrated that from infinitely small distances I can put together a finitely large distance; that is, what is here set forth in the form of a story is the dialectical law which we have previously mentioned. It is shown that a distance can be finite as well as infinite, that it can be both, in fact, at the same time. Thus it is true, as can easily be calculated, that the arrow can travel from A to B, and it is just as true that Achilles will overtake the tortoise.

Let us take the tortoise: While Achilles has traversed the handicap of one hundred yards, the tortoise has gone ahead ten yards, etc. Thus we have 100 + 10 + 1 + 1/10 + 1/100 . . . = 111.11 or 111 1/9 yards. At this point he will overtake the tortoise. He consumes ten seconds for 100 yards, 1 second for the next 10 yards, 1/10 of a second for the 1 yard, etc. Together, 10 + 1 + 1/10 ... = 11.1, or 11 1/9 seconds. Thus the question is solved. And at the same time we have another verification of our proposition that motion is contradictory.

Now, in order to clarify the matter, I will return to the first example, in which a distance which we designate 1 is composed of 1/2's; half of the distance is again divided into equal parts of 1/4, which in turn are divided into equal parts of 1/8, etc. Thus we have the series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32. . . . If we add them, we find that their sum more and more closely approaches 1. The sum of the infinitely many fractions, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8, etc., is the finite total 1. This is perfectly accurate.

From my statement that contradictions occur in things, we must not conclude inversely that I always utter a truth when I contradict myself. The matter is not so simple; rather these contradictions which appear in concepts are only appropriate and correct if they reflect actual changes in things.

Thus there are meaningful and meaningless contradictions, and dialectics is not the art of meaningless, but of meaningful contradictions. Wherein lies the difference between formal logic and dialectics? If you look closely, you will find that it lies in the following: Formal logic considers all things as motionless and changeless, each as separate from all others, isolated in itself. Dialectics is a higher form of thought, since it considers them also in their motion and in their interconnection. What is the reciprocal relation of formal logic and dialectics? The use of formal logic is limited, restricted. It is a restricted, inferior approach to phenomena. It is admissible so far as I can consider things as unchanged and rigidly demarcated from each other. Dialectics is a superior, more universal, more exact, and more profound approach to phenomena. As soon as I consider things as moved, as changeable, or in their reciprocal connection, I get nowhere with formal logic and I must turn to dialectics. I wish to add that the dialectics of both Plato and Aristotle had an idealistic character; that is, both assume that contradictions have their origin in the mind and that the contradictions in actual things derive from the mind. We materialistic dialecticians say that the contradictions in concepts are only a reflection of the motion of things.

To put this even more simply: Idealistic dialecticians believe that motion of bodies occurs because a contradiction is present in the concept of motion. The materialistic dialecticians say the opposite: The actual motion of things is the prototype, and the contradictions which appear in the concept are reflections of this actual motion.

Let us inquire into the sources of dialectics in antiquity. Why was it that in antiquity man had already come upon the foundations of the dialectical method of thinking? 1. The old philosophers of nature, Heraclitus, Anaximander, etc., investigated the emergence and decline of the world. They thus had to arrive at the concept of the universal change and the universal motion of all things. I refer to Heraclitus especially. 2. Social relations, meditation on the form of the State, on religion, etc., stimulated the consideration of all things as changeful and self-contradictory. (This applies especially to Socrates, Plato, etc.) The immediate stimulus was that in public life contradictory viewpoints clashed one with another. Public life in Athens was a very lively affair. In the market-place discussions were constantly taking place concerning what is good and what is evil, how the State should be constituted, etc. One said A, another Not-A. This was true of all things in public and private life. From this there ultimately developed an art of conversation, and this art of conversation became the source of the art of dialectics. Dialectics was originally called the art of discourse because it grew out of discourse.

This ancient dialectics as developed by Plato and Aristotle was not yet the modern dialectics which is characteristic of dialectical materialism. It was still an undeveloped dialectics. This is consistent with the social relations from which this manner of thinking emerged. The aim of these ancient thinkers, Plato and Aristotle, was to find amidst the change of social and political matters something permanent, constant, secure, to create an ideal State, an ideal society. They did not seek absolute change; their aim, on the contrary, was a changeless, constant state of affairs. They did not favor revolution, but rather the suppression of the revolution which had taken place in the social order. This is why Plato constructed a political utopia, an ideal State. And thus is explained the limited and undeveloped form of dialectics in antiquity. In ancient times there were two stages in the development of dialectics: the first was simply the dialectics of change, of the one-after-the-other. This was the dialectics developed by Heraclitus. The second is dialectics as developed particularly by Plato and Aristotle. This is a dialectics not of one-after-the-other, but a dialectics of one-beside-the-other, of the simultaneous; the dialectics which is present in the relation of the parts of a motionless whole to each other. This second form of dialectics is the highest developed in antiquity. But it is a limited form. The higher form of dialectics is that which takes into consideration the dialectics of the simultaneous as well as the dialectics of one-after the-other. This dialectics is called historical dialectics. This historical dialectics embraces the law of the changes of a whole as well as the law of the simultaneous existence of a whole which is composed of many parts. You have an example of this if from your study of political economy you remember the way Marx describes capital. You there learned a number of economic laws which show how capitalism can exist as a whole and how individual phenomena within it are related to each other. Finally, you learned how this whole system emerges from another system, that of simple commodity production, and further, how the laws of the capitalist mode of production are changed in the course of time into other laws which lead from capitalism into another, opposed system, that of socialist economy. The most highly developed form of dialectics is Marxian or historical dialectics, which developed from the limited and restricted form of antiquity into a higher form.

This ancient dialectics is. in the last analysis, limited and restricted because it is the dialectics of a ruling class which rests on slave labor. Neither Plato nor Aristotle, the most advanced thinkers of this society, could imagine a change in social relations such that slave labor would disappear and the distinction between freeman and slave be abolished.

Therefore, it follows that their concept of the change of things had a completely determined social mold, namely, the mold wherein domination over slaves must always be changeless and eternal. Accordingly, they could not develop dialectics in its full universality, since this universality presupposes _that no molds can be imposed upon change._ But as usufructuaries of slave ownership they were unable to pre-suppose the abolition of slavery. This is the ultimate reason why they could not develop dialectics in its full universality, why it was restricted and idealistic - and not materialistic.

Engels' Dialectics of Nature

# III. Basic Forms of Motion

Motion in the most general sense, conceived as the mode of existence, the inherent attribute of matter, comprehends all changes and processes occurring in the universe, from mere change of place right up to thinking. The investigation of the nature of motion had, as a matter of course, to start from the lowest, simplest forms of this motion and to learn to grasp these before it could achieve anything in the way of explanation of the higher and more complicated forms. Hence, in the historical evolution of the natural sciences we see how first of all the theory of simplest change of place, the mechanics of heavenly bodies and terrestrial masses, was developed; it was followed by the theory of molecular motion, physics, and immediately afterwards, almost alongside of it and in some places in advance of it, the science of the motion of atoms, chemistry. Only after these different branches of the knowledge of the forms of motion governing non-living nature had attained a high degree of development could the explanation of the processes of motion represented by the life process be successfully tackled. This advanced in proportion with the progress of mechanics, physics, and chemistry. Consequently, while mechanics has for a fairly long time already been able adequately to refer to the effects in the animal body of the bony levers set into motion by muscular contraction and to the laws that prevail also in non-living nature, the physico-chemical establishment of the other phenomena of life is still pretty much at the beginning of its course. Hence, in investigating here the nature of motion, we are compelled to leave the organic forms of motion out of account. We are compelled to restrict ourselves - in accordance with the state of science - to the forms of motion of non-living nature.

All motion is bound up with some change of place, whether it be change of place of heavenly bodies, terrestrial masses, molecules, atoms, or ether particles. The higher the form of motion, the smaller this change of place. It in no way exhausts the nature of the motion concerned, but it is inseparable from the motion. It, therefore, has to be investigated before anything else.

The whole of nature accessible to us forms a system, an interconnected totality of bodies, and by bodies we understand here all material existence extending from stars to atoms, indeed right to ether particles, in so far as one grants the existence of the last named. In the fact that these bodies are interconnected is already included that they react on one another, and it is precisely this mutual reaction that constitutes motion. It already becomes evident here that matter is unthinkable without motion. And if, in addition, matter confronts us as something given, equally uncreatable as indestructible, it follows that motion also is as uncreatable as indestructible. It became impossible to reject this conclusion as soon as it was recognised that the universe is a system, an interconnection of bodies. And since this recognition had been reached by philosophy long before it came into effective operation in natural science, it is explicable why philosophy, fully two hundred years before natural science, drew the conclusion of the uncreatability and indestructibility of motion. Even the form in which it did so is still superior to the present day formulation of natural science. Descartes' principle, that the amount of motion present in the universe is always the same, has only the formal defect of applying a finite expression to an infinite magnitude. On the other hand, two expressions of the same law are at present current in natural science: Helmholtz's law of the conservation of force, and the newer, more precise, one of the conservation of energy. Of these, the one, as we shall see, says the exact opposite of the other, and moreover each of them expresses only one side of the relation.

When two bodies act on each other so that a change of place of one or both of them results, this change of place can consist only in an approach or a separation. They either attract each other or they repel each other. Or, as mechanics expresses it, the forces operating between them are central, acting along the line joining their centres. That this happens, that it is the case throughout the universe without exception, however complicated many movements may appear to be, is nowadays accepted as a matter of course. It would seem nonsensical to us to assume, when two bodies act on each other and their mutual interaction is not opposed by any obstacle or the influence of a third body, that this action should be effected otherwise than along the shortest and most direct path, i.e. along the straight line joining their centres. It is well known, moreover, that Helmholtz (_Erhaltung der Kraft [The Conservation of Force]_, Berlin, 1847, Sections 1 and 2) has provided the mathematical proof that central action and unalterability of the quantity of motion are reciprocally conditioned and that the assumption of other than central actions leads to results in which motion could be either created or destroyed. Hence the basic form of all motion is approximation and separation, contraction and expansion - in short, the old polar opposites of _attraction_ and _repulsion_.

It is expressly to be noted that attraction and repulsion are not regarded here as so-called "_forces_" but as _simple forms of motion_, just as Kant had already conceived matter as the unity of attraction and repulsion. What is to be understood by the conception of "forces" will be shown in due course.

All motion consists in the interplay of attraction and repulsion. Motion, however, is only possible when each individual attraction is compensated by a corresponding repulsion somewhere else. Otherwise in time one side would get the preponderance over the other and then motion would finally cease. Hence all attractions and all repulsions in the universe must mutually balance one another. Thus the law of the indestructibility and uncreatibility of motion takes the form that each movement of attraction in the universe must have as its complement an equivalent movement of repulsion and _vice versa_; or, as ancient philosophy - long before the natural scientific formulation of the law of conservation of force or energy - expressed it: the sum of all attractions in the universe is equal to the sum of all repulsions.

However it appears that there are still two possibilities for all motion to cease at some time or other, either by repulsion and attraction finally cancelling each other out in actual fact, or by the total repulsion finally taking possession of one part of matter and the total attraction of the other part. For the dialectical conception, these possibilities are excluded from the outset. Dialectics has proved from the results of our experience of nature so far that all polar opposites in general are determined by the mutual action of the two opposite poles on one another, that the separation and opposition of these poles exists only within their unity and inter-connection, and, conversely, that their inter-connection exists only in their separation and their unity only in their opposition. This once established, there can be no question of a final cancelling out of repulsion and attraction, or of a final partition between the one form of motion in one half of matter and the other form in the other half, consequently there can be no question of mutual penetration or of absolute separation of the two poles. It would be equivalent to demanding in the first case that the north and south poles of a magnet should mutually cancel themselves out or, in the second case, that dividing a magnet in the middle between the two poles should produce on one side a north half without a south pole, and on the other side a south half without a north pole. Although, however, the impermissibility of such assumptions follows at once from the dialectical nature of polar opposites, nevertheless, thanks to the prevailing metaphysical mode of thought of natural scientists, the second assumption at least plays a certain part in physical theory. This will be dealt with in its place.

How does motion present itself in the interaction of attraction and repulsion? We can best investigate this in the separate forms of motion itself. At the end, the general aspect of the matter will show itself.

Let us take the motion of a planet about its central body. The ordinary school textbook of astronomy follows Newton in explaining the ellipse described as the result of the joint action of two forces, the attraction of the central body and a tangential force driving the planet along the normal to the direction of this attraction. Thus it assumes, besides the form of motion directed centrally, also another direction of motion or so-called "force" perpendicular to the line joining the central points. Thereby it contradicts the above-mentioned basic law according to which all motion in our universe can only take place along the line joining the central points of the bodies acting on one another, or, as one says, is caused only by centrally acting forces. Equally, it introduces into the theory an element of motion which, as we have likewise seen, necessarily leads to the creation and destruction of motion, and therefore presupposes a creator. What had to be done, therefore, was to reduce this mysterious tangential force to a form of motion acting centrally, and this the Kant-Laplace theory of cosmogony accomplished. As is well known, according to this conception the whole solar system arose from a rotating, extremely tenuous, gaseous mass by gradual contraction. The rotational motion is obviously strongest at the equator of this gaseous sphere, and individual gaseous rings separate themselves from the mass and clump themselves together into planets, planetoids, etc., which revolve round the central body in the direction of the original rotation. This rotation itself is usually explained from the motion characteristic of the individual particles of gas. This motion takes place in all directions, hut finally an excess in one particular direction makes itself evident and so causes the rotating motion, which is bound to become stronger and stronger with the progressive contraction of the gaseous sphere. But whatever hypothesis is assumed of the origin of the rotation, it abolishes the tangential force, dissolving it in a special form of the phenomena of centrally acting motion. If the one element of planetary motion, the directly central one, is represented by gravitation, the attraction between the planet and the central body, then the other tangential element appears as a relic, in a derivative or altered form, of the original repulsion of the individual particles of the gaseous sphere. Then the life process of a solar system presents itself as an interplay of attraction and repulsion, in which attraction gradually more and more gets the upper hand owing to repulsion being radiated into space in the form of heat and thus more and more becoming lost to the system.

One sees at a glance that the form of motion here conceived as repulsion is the same as that which modern physics terms "_energy_." By the contraction of the system and the resulting detachment of the individual bodies of which it consists to-day, the system has lost "energy," and indeed this loss, according to Helmholtz's well-known calculation, already amounts to 453/454 of the total quantity of motion originally present in the form of repulsion.

Let us take now a mass in the shape of a body on our earth itself. It is connected with the earth by gravitation, as the earth in turn is with the sun; but unlike the earth it is incapable of a free planetary motion. It can be set in motion only by an impulse from outside, and even then, as soon as the impulse ceases, its movement speedily comes to a standstill, whether by the effect of gravity alone or by the latter in combination with the resistance of the medium in which it moves. This resistance also is in the last resort an effect of gravity, in the absence of which the earth would not have on its surface any resistant medium, any atmosphere. Hence in pure mechanical motion on the earth's surface we are concerned with a situation in which gravitation, attraction, decisively predominates, where therefore the production of the motion shows both phases: first counteracting gravity and then allowing gravity to act - in a word, production of rising and falling.

Thus we have again mutual action between attraction on the one hand and a form of motion taking place in the opposite direction to it, hence a repelling form of motion, on the other hand. But within the sphere of terrestrial _pure_ mechanics (which deals with masses of _given_ states of aggregation and cohesion taken by it as unalterable) this repelling form of motion does not occur in nature. The physical and chemical conditions under which a lump of rock becomes separated from a mountain top, or a fall of water becomes possible, lie outside our sphere. Therefore, in terrestrial pure mechanics, the repelling, raising motion must be produced artificially: by human force, animal force, water or steam power, etc. And this circumstance, this necessity to combat the natural attraction artificially, causes the mechanicians to adopt the view that attraction, gravitation, or, as they say, the force of gravity, is the most important, indeed the basic, form of motion in nature.

When, for instance, a weight is raised and communicates motion to other bodies by falling directly or indirectly, then according to the usual view of mechanics it is not the raising of the weight which communicates this motion but the force of gravity. Thus Helmholtz, for instance, makes "the force which is the simplest and the one with which we are best acquainted, viz. gravity, act as the driving force... for instance in grandfather clocks that are actuated by a weight. The weight... cannot comply with the pull of gravity without setting the whole clockwork in motion." But it cannot set the clockwork in motion without itself sinking and it goes on sinking until the string from which it hangs is completely unwound:

"Then the clock comes to a stop, for the operative capacity of the weight is exhausted for the time being. Its weight is not lost or diminished, it remains attracted to the same extent by the earth, but the capacity of this weight to produce movements has been lost.... We can, however, wind up the clock by the power of the human arm, whereby the weight is once more raised up. As soon as this has happened, it regains its previous operative capacity and can again keep the clock in motion." (Helmholtz, _Popular Lectures_, German Edition, II. pp. 144 - 5.)

According to Helmholtz, therefore, it is not the active communication of motion, the raising of the weight, that sets the clock into motion, but the passive heaviness of the weight, although this same heaviness is only withdrawn from its passivity by the raising, and once again returns to passivity after the string of the weight has unwound. If then according to the modern conception, as we saw above, energy is only another expression for repulsion, here in the older Helmholtz conception force appears as another expression for the opposite of repulsion, for attraction. For the time being we shall simply put this on record.

When this process, as far as terrestrial mechanics is concerned, has reached its end, when the heavy mass has first of all been raised and then again let fall through the same height, what becomes of the motion that constituted it? For pure mechanics, it has disappeared. But we know now that it has by no means been destroyed. To a lesser extent it has been conveyed into the air as oscillations of sound waves, to a much greater extent into heat - which has been communicated in part to the resisting atmosphere, in part to the falling body itself, and finally in part to the floor, on which the weight comes to rest. The clock weight has also gradually given up its motion in the form of frictional heat to the separate driving wheels of the clockwork. But, although usually expressed in this way, it is not the falling motion, i.e.. the attraction, that has passed into heat, and therefore into a form of repulsion. On the contrary, as Helmholtz correctly remarks, the attraction, the heaviness, remains what it previously was and, accurately speaking, becomes even greater. Rather it is the repulsion communicated to the raised body by rising that is mechanically destroyed by falling and reappears as heat. The repulsion of masses is transformed into molecular repulsion.

Heat, as already stated, is a form of repulsion. It sets the molecules of solid bodies into oscillation, thereby loosening the connections of the separate molecules until finally the transition to the liquid state takes place. In the liquid state also, on continued addition of heat, it increases the motion of the molecules until a degree is reached at which the latter split off altogether from the mass and, at a definite velocity determined for each molecule by its chemical constitution, they move away individually in the free state. With a still further addition of heat, this velocity is further increased, and so the molecules are more and more repelled from one another.

But heat is a form of so-called "energy"; here once again the latter proves to be identical with repulsion.

In the phenomena of static electricity and magnetism, we have a polar division of attraction and repulsion. Whatever hypothesis may be adopted of the _modus operandi_ of these two forms of motion, in view of the facts no one has any doubt that attraction and repulsion, in so far as they are produced by static electricity or magnetism and are able to develop unhindered, completely compensate one another, as in fact necessarily follows from the very nature of the polar division. Two poles whose activities did not completely compensate each other would indeed not be poles, and also have so far not been discovered in nature. For the time being we will leave galvanism out of account, because in its case the process is determined by chemical reactions, which makes it more complicated. Therefore, let us investigate rather the chemical processes of motion themselves.

When two parts by weight of hydrogen combine with 15.96 parts by weight of oxygen to form water vapour, an amount of heat of 68,924 heat units is developed during the process. Conversely, if 17.96 parts by weight of water vapour are to be decomposed into 2 parts by weight of hydrogen and 15.96 parts by weight of oxygen, this is only possible on condition that the water vapour has communicated to it an amount of motion equivalent to 68,924 heat units - whether in the form of heat itself or of electrical motion. The same thing holds for all other chemical processes. In the overwhelming majority of cases, motion is given off on combination and must be supplied on decomposition. Here, too, as a rule, repulsion is the active side of the process more endowed with motion or requiring the addition of motion, while attraction is the passive side producing a surplus of motion and giving off motion. On this account, the modern theory also declares that, on the whole, energy is set free on the combination of elements and is bound up on decomposition. And Helmholtz declares:

"This force (chemical affinity) can be conceived as a force of _attraction_.... This force of attraction between the atoms of carbon and oxygen performs work quite as much as that exerted on a raised weight by the earth in the form of gravitation.... When carbon and oxygen atoms rush at one another and combine to form carbonic acid, the newly-formed particles of carbonic acid must be in very violent molecular motion, i.e. in heat motion.... When after they have given up their heat to the environment, we still have in the carbonic acid all the carbon, all the oxygen, and in addition the affinity of both continuing to exist just as powerfully as before. But this affinity now expresses itself solely in the fact that the atoms of carbon and oxygen stick fast to one another, and do not allow of their being separated" (Helmholtz, _loc. cit_., p. 169).

It is just as before: Helmholtz insists that in chemistry as in mechanics _force_ consists only in _attraction_, and therefore is the exact opposite of what other physicists call energy and which is identical with repulsion.

Hence we have now no longer the two simple basic forms of attraction and repulsion, but a whole series of sub-forms in which the winding up and running down process of universal motion goes on in opposition to both attraction and repulsion. It is, however, by no means merely in our mind that these manifold forms of appearance are comprehended under the single expression of motion. On the contrary, they themselves prove in action that they are forms of one and the same motion by passing into one another under given conditions. Mechanical motion of masses passes into heat, into electricity, into magnetism; heat and electricity pass into chemical decomposition; chemical combination in turn develops heat and electricity and, by means of the latter, magnetism; and finally, heat and electricity produce once more mechanical movement of masses. Moreover, these changes take place in such a way that a given quantity of motion of one form always has corresponding to it an exactly fixed quantity of another form. Further, it is a matter of indifference which form of motion provides the unit by which the amount of motion is measured, whether it serves for measuring mass motion, heat, so-called electromotive force, or the motion undergoing transformation in chemical processes.

We base ourselves here on the theory of the "conservation of energy" established by J. R. Mayer [[Bolsjevikkerne (1917)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch03.htm#1.) in 1842 and afterwards worked out internationally with such brilliant success, and we have now to investigate the fundamental concepts nowadays made use of by this theory. These are the concepts of "force", "energy", and "work".

It has been shown above that according to the modern view, now fairly generally accepted, energy is the term used for repulsion, while Helmholtz generally uses the word force to express attraction. One could regard this as a mere distinction of form, inasmuch as attraction and repulsion compensate each other in the universe, and accordingly it would appear a matter of indifference which side of the relation is taken as positive and which as negative, just as it is of no importance in itself whether the positive abscissae are counted to the right or the left of a point in a given line. Nevertheless, this is not absolutely so.

For we are concerned here, first of all, not with the universe, but with phenomena occurring on the earth and conditioned by the exact position of the earth in the solar system, and of the solar system in the universe. At every moment, however, our solar system gives out enormous quantities of motion into space, and motion of a very definite quality, viz. the sun's heat, _i.e._ repulsion. But our earth itself allows of the existence of life on it only owing to the sun's heat, and it in turn finally radiates into space the sun's heat received, after it has converted a portion of this heat into other forms of motion. Consequently, in the solar system and above all on the earth, attraction already considerably preponderates over repulsion. Without the repulsive motion radiated to us from the sun, all motion on the earth would cease. If to-morrow the sun were to become cold, the attraction on the earth would still, other circumstances remaining the same, be what it is to-day. As before, a stone of 100 kilogrammes, wherever situated, would weigh 100 kilogrammes. But the motion, both of masses and of molecules and atoms, would come to what we would regard as an absolute standstill. Therefore it is clear that for processes occurring on the _earth_ to-day it is by no means a matter of indifference whether attraction or repulsion is conceived as the active side of motion, hence as "force" or "energy." On the contrary, on the earth to-day attraction has already become _altogether passive_ owing to its decisive preponderance over repulsion; we owe all active motion to the supply of repulsion from the sun. Therefore, the modern school - even if it remains unclear about the nature of the relation constituting motion - nevertheless, in point of fact and for _terrestrial_ processes, indeed for the whole solar system, is absolutely right in conceiving energy as repulsion.

The expression "energy" by no means correctly expresses all the relationships of motion, for it comprehends only one aspect, the action but not the reaction. It still makes it appear as if "energy" was something external to matter, something implanted in it. But in all circumstances it is to be preferred to the expression "force."

As conceded on all hands (from Hegel to Helmholtz), the notion of force is derived from the activity of the human organism within its environment. We speak of muscular force, of the lifting force of the arm, of the leaping power of the legs, of the digestive force of the stomach and intestinal canal, of the sensory force of the nerves, of the secretory force of the glands, etc. In other words, in order to save having to give the real cause of a change brought about by a function of our organism, we fabricate a fictitious cause, a so-called force corresponding to the change. Then we carry this convenient method over to the external world also, and so invent as many forces as there are diverse phenomena.

In Hegel's time natural science (with the exception perhaps of heavenly and terrestrial mechanics) was still in this naive state, and Hegel quite correctly attacks the prevailing way of denoting forces (passage to be quoted).[[Fabriksrådet (1920)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch03.htm#2.) Similarly in another passage:

"It is better (to say) that a magnet has a _Soul_ (as Thales expresses it) than that it has an attracting force; force is a kind of property which is _separable from matter_ and put forward as a predicate - while soul, on the other hand, _is its movement, identical with the nature of matter_." (_Geschichte der Philosophie_ [History of Philosophy], I, p. 208.)

To-day we no longer make it so easy for ourselves in regard to forces. Let us listen to Helmholtz:

"If we are fully acquainted with a natural law, we must also demand that it should operate without exception.... Thus the law confronts us as an objective power, and accordingly we term it a _force_. For instance, we objectivise the law of the refraction of light as a refractive power of transparent substances, the law of chemical affinities as a force of affinity of the various substances for one another. Thus we speak of the electrical force of contact of metals, of the force of adhesion, capillary force, and so on. These names objectivise laws which in the first place embrace only a limited series of natural processes, _the conditions for which are still rather complicated_.... Force is only the objectivised law of action.... The abstract idea of force introduced by us only makes the addition that we have not arbitrarily invented this law but that it is a compulsory law of phenomena. Hence our demand to _understand_ the phenomena of nature, _i.e._ to find out their laws, takes on another form of expression, viz. that we have to seek out the _forces_ which are the causes of the phenomena." (_lLoc. cit_., pp. 189 - 191. Innsbruck lecture of 1869.)

Firstly, it is certainly a peculiar manner of "objectivising" if the _purely subjective_ notion of _force_ is introduced into a natural law that has already been established as independent of our subjectivity and therefore completely _objective_. At most an Old-Hegelian of the strictest type might permit himself such a thing, but not a Neo-Kantian like Helmholtz. Neither the law, when once established, nor its objectivity, nor that of its action, acquires the slightest new objectivity by our interpolating a force into it; what is added is our _subjective assertion_ that it acts in virtue of some so far entirely unknown force. The secret meaning, however, of this interpolating is seen as soon as Helmholtz gives us examples: refraction of light, chemical affinity, contact electricity, adhesion, capillarity, and confers on the laws that govern these phenomena the "objective" honorary rank of _forces_. "These names objectivise laws which in the first place embrace only a limited series of natural processes, the conditions for which _are still rather complicated_." And it is just here that the "objectivising," which is rather subjectivising, gets its meaning; not because we have become fully acquainted with the law, but just because this is _not_ the case. Just because we are _not_ yet clear about the "rather complicated conditions" of these phenomena, we often resort here to the word force. We express thereby not our scientific knowledge, but our _lack_ of scientific knowledge of the nature of the law and its mode of action. In this sense, as a short expression for a causal connection that has not yet been explained, as a makeshift expression, it may pass for current usage. Anything more than that is bad. With just as much right as Helmholtz explains physical phenomena from so-called refractive force, electrical force of contact, etc., the medieval scholastics explained temperature changes by means of a _vis calorifica_ and a _vis frigifaciens_ and thus saved themselves all further investigation of heat phenomena.

And even in this sense it is one-sided, for it expresses everything in a one-sided manner. All natural processes are two-sided, they rest on the relation of at least two effective parts, action and reaction. The notion of force, however, owing to its origin from the action of the human organism on the external world, and further because of terrestrial mechanics, implies that only one part is active, effective, the other part being passive, receptive; hence it lays down a not yet demonstrable extension of the difference between the sexes to non-living objects. The reaction of the second part, on which the force works, appears at most as a passive reaction, as a _resistance_. This mode of conception is permissible in a number of fields even outside pure mechanics, namely where it is a matter of the simple transference of motion and its quantitative calculation. But already in the more complicated physical processes it is no longer adequate, as Helmholtz's own examples prove. The refractive force lies just as much in the light itself as in the transparent bodies. In the case of adhesion and capillarity, it is certain that the "force" is just as much situated in the surface of the solid as in the liquid. In contact electricity, at any rate, it is certain that _both_ metals contribute to it, and "chemical affinity" also is situated, if anywhere, in _both_ the parts entering into combination. But a force which consists of separated forces, an action which does not evoke its reaction, but which exists solely by itself, is no force in the sense of terrestrial mechanics, the only science in which one really knows what is meant by a force. For the basic conditions of terrestrial mechanics are, firstly, refusal to investigate the causes of the impulse, _i.e._ the nature of the particular force, and, secondly, the view of the one-sidedness of the force, it being everywhere opposed by au identical gravitational force, such that in comparison with any terrestrial distance of fall the earth's radius = _(infinity)_.

But let us see further how Helmholtz, "objectivises" his "forces" into natural laws.

In a lecture of 1854 (_loc. cit._., p. 119) he examines the "store of working force" originally contained in the nebular sphere from which our solar system was formed. "In point of fact it received an enormously large legacy in this respect, if only in the form of the general force of attraction of all its parts for one another." This indubitably is so. But it is equally indubitable that the whole of this legacy of gravitation is present undiminished in the solar system to-day, apart perhaps from the minute quantity that was lost together with the matter ' We should now call this potential energy. which was flung out, possibly irrevocably, into space. Further, "The chemical forces too must have been already present and ready to act; but as these forces could become effective only on intimate contact of the various kinds of masses, condensation had to take place before they came into play." If, as Hclmholtz does above, we regard these chemical forces as forces of affinity, hence as _attraction_, then again we are bound to say that the sum-total of these chemical forces of attraction still exists undiminished within the solar system.

But on the same page Helmholtz gives us the results of his calculations "that perhaps only the 454th part of the original mechanical force exists as such" - that is to say, in the solar system. How is one to make sense of that? The force of attraction, general as well as chemical, is still present unimpaired in the solar system. Helmholtz does not mention any other certain source of force. In any case, according to Helmholtz, these forces have performed tremendous work. But they have neither increased nor diminished on that account. As it is with the clock weight mentioned above, so it is with every molecule in the solar system and with the solar system itself. "Its gravitation is neither lost nor diminished." What happens to carbon and oxygen as previously mentioned holds good for all chemical elements: the total given quantity of each one remains, and "the total force of affinity continues to exist just as powerfully as before." What have we lost then? And what "force" has performed the tremendous work which is 453 times as big as that which, according to his calculation, the solar system is still able to perform? Up to this point Helmholtz has given no answer. But further on he says:

"Whether a further _reserve of force in the shape of heat_ was present, we do not know." - But, if we may be allowed to mention it, heat is a repulsive "force," it acts therefore _against_ the direction of both gravitation and chemical attraction, being minus if these are put as plus. Hence if, according to Helmholtz, the original store of force is composed of general and chemical attraction, an extra reserve of heat would have to be, not added to that reserve of force, but subtracted from it. Otherwise the sun's heat would have had to _strengthen_ the force of attraction of the earth when it causes water to evaporate in direct opposition to this attraction, and the water vapour to rise; or the heat of an incandescent iron tube through which steam is passed would _strengthen_ the chemical attraction of oxygen and water, whereas it puts it out of action. Or, to make the same thing clear in another form: let us assume that the nebular sphere with radius _r_, and therefore with volume 4/3(pi)r³ has a temperature _t_. Let us further assume a second nebular sphere of equal mass having at the higher temperature T the larger radius R and volume 4/3(pi)R³. Now it is obvious that in the second nebular sphere the attraction, mechanical as well as physical and chemical, can act with the same force as in the first only when it has shrunk from radius R to radius _r, i.e._ when it has radiated into world space heat corresponding to the temperature difference T - _t_. A hotter nebular sphere will therefore condense later than a colder one; consequently the heat, considered from Helmholtz's standpoint as an obstacle to condensation, is no plus but a minus of the "reserve of force." Helmholtz, by pre-supposing the possibility of a quantum of _repulsive_ motion in the form of heat becoming added to the _attractive_ forms of motion and increasing the total of these latter, commits a definite error of calculation.

Let us now bring the whole of this "reserve of force", possible as well as demonstrable, under the same mathematical sign so that an addition is possible. Since for the time being we cannot reverse the heat and replace its repulsion by the equivalent attraction, we shall have to perform this reversal with the two forms of attraction. Then, instead of the general force of attraction, instead of the chemical affinity, and instead of the heat, which moreover possibly already exists as such at the outset, we have simply to put - the sum of the repulsive motion or so-called energy present in the gaseous sphere at the moment when it becomes independent. And by so doing Helmholtz's calculation will also hold, in which he wants to calculate "the heating that must arise from the assumed initial condensation of the heavenly bodies of our system from nebulously scattered matter." By thus reducing the whole "reserve of force" to heat, repulsion, he also makes it possible to add on the assumed "heat reserve force". The calculation then asserts that 453/454 of all the energy, _i.e._ repulsion, originally present in the gaseous sphere has been radiated into space in the form of heat, or, to put it accurately, that the sum of all attraction in the present solar system is to the sum of all repulsion, still present in the same, as 453: 1. But then it directly contradicts the text of the lecture to which it is added as proof.

If then the notion of force, even in the case of a physicist like Helmholtz, gives rise to such confusion of ideas, this is the best proof that it is in general not susceptible of scientific use in all branches of investigation which go beyond the calculations of mechanics. In mechanics the causes of motion are taken as given and their origin is disregarded, only their effects being taken into account. Hence if a cause of motion is termed a force, this does no damage to mechanics as such; but it becomes the custom to transfer this term also to physics, chemistry, and biology, and then confusion is inevitable. We have already seen this and shall frequently see it again.

For the concept of work, see the next chapter.

### Notes

[1.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch03.htm#[1]) Helmholtz, in his _Pop. Vorlesungen [Popular Lectures]_, II, p. 113, appears to ascribe a certain share in the natural scientific proof of Descartes' principle of the quantitative immutability of motion to himself as well as to Mayer, Joule, and Codling. "I myself, without knowing anything of Mayer and Codling, and only becoming acquainted with Joule's experiments at the end of my work, _proceeded along the same path_; I occupied myself especially with searching out all the relations between the various processes of nature that could be deduced from the given mode of consideration, and I published my investigations in 1847 in a little work entitled _Uber die Erhaltung der Kraft [On the Conservation of Force]_." - But in this work there is to be found nothing new for the position in 1847 beyond the above-mentioned, mathematically very valuable, development that "conservation of force" and central action of the forces active between the various bodies of a system are only two different expressions for the same thing, and further a more accurate formulation of the law that the sum of the live and tensional forces in a given _mechanical_ system is constant. In every other respect, it was already superseded since Mayer's second paper of 1845. Already in 1842 Mayer maintained the "indestructibility of force", and from his new standpoint in 1845 he had much more brilliant things to say about the "relations between the various processes of nature" than Helmholtz had in 1847.

# I. Introduction

§1

Philosophy misses an advantage enjoyed by the other sciences. It cannot like them rest the existence of its objects on the natural admissions of consciousness, nor can it assume that its method of cognition, either for starting or for continuing, is one already accepted. The objects of philosophy, it is true, are upon the whole the same as those of religion. In both the object is Truth, in that supreme sense in which God and God only is the Truth. Both in like manner go on to treat of the finite worlds of Nature and the human Mind, with their relation to each other and to their truth in God. Some _**acquaintance**_ with its objects, therefore, philosophy may and even must presume, that and a certain interest in them to boot, were it for no other reason than this: that in point of time the mind makes general _**images**_ of objects, long before it makes _**notions**_ of them, and that it is only through these mental images, and by recourse to them, that the thinking mind rises to know and comprehend _**thinkingly**_.

But with the rise of this thinking study of things, it soon becomes evident that thought will be satisfied with nothing short of showing the _**necessity**_ of its facts, of demonstrating the existence of its objects, as well as their nature and qualities. Our original acquaintance with them is thus discovered to be inadequate. We can assume nothing and assert nothing dogmatically; nor can we accept the assertions and assumptions of others. And yet we must make a beginning: and a beginning, as primary and underived, makes an assumption, or rather is an assumption. It seems as if it were impossible to make a beginning at all.

§ 2

This _**thinking study of things**_ may serve, in a general way, as a description of philosophy. But the description is too wide. If it be correct to say, that thought makes the distinction between man and the lower animals, then everything human is human, for the sole and simple reason that it is due to the operation of thought. Philosophy, on the other hand, is a peculiar mode of thinking — a mode in which thinking becomes knowledge, and knowledge through notions. However great therefore may be the identity and essential unity of the two modes of thought, the philosophic mode gets to be different from the more general thought which acts in all that is human, in all that gives humanity its distinctive character. And this difference connects itself with the fact that the strictly human and thought-induced phenomena of consciousness do not originally appear in the form of a thought, but as a feeling, a perception, or mental image — all of which aspects must be distinguished from the form of thought proper.

According to an old preconceived idea, which has passed into a trivial proposition, it is thought which marks the man off from the animals. Yet trivial as this old belief may seem, it must, strangely enough, be recalled to mind in presence of certain preconceived ideas of the present day. These ideas would put feeling and thought so far apart as to make them opposites, and would represent them as so antagonistic, that feeling, particularly religious feeling, is supposed to be contaminated, perverted, and even annihilated by thought. They also emphatically hold that religion and piety grow out of, and rest upon something else, and not on thought. But those who make this separation forget meanwhile that only man has the capacity for religion, and that animals no more have religion than they have law and morality.

Those who insist on this separation of religion from thinking usually have before their minds the sort of thought that may be styled _**after-thought**_. They mean ‘reflective’ thinking, which has to deal with thoughts as thoughts, and brings them into consciousness. Slackness to perceive and keep in view this distinction which philosophy definitely draws in respect of thinking is the source of the crudest objections and reproaches against philosophy. Man — and that just because it is his nature to think — is the only being that possesses law, religion, and morality. In these spheres of human life, therefore, thinking, under the guise of feeling, faith, or generalised image, has not been inactive: its action and its productions are there present and therein contained. But it is one thing to have such feelings and generalised images that have been moulded and permeated by thought, and another thing to have thoughts about them. The thoughts, to which after-thought upon those modes of consciousness gives rise, are what is comprised under reflection, general reasoning, and the like, as well as under philosophy itself.

The neglect of this distinction between thought in general and the reflective thought of philosophy has also led to another and more frequent misunderstanding. Reflection of this kind has been often maintained to be the condition, or even the only way, of attaining a consciousness and certitude of the Eternal and True. The (now somewhat antiquated) metaphysical proofs of God’s existence, for example, have been treated, as if a knowledge of them and a conviction of their truth were the only and essential means of producing a belief and conviction that there is a God. Such a doctrine would find its parallel, if we said that eating was impossible before we had acquired a knowledge of the chemical, botanical, and zoological characters of our food; and that we must delay digestion till we had finished the study of anatomy and physiology. Were it so, these sciences in their field, like philosophy in its, would gain greatly in point of utility; in fact, their utility would rise to the height of absolute and universal indispensableness. Or rather, instead of being indispensable, they would not exist at all.

§ 3

The _**Content**_, of whatever kind it be, with which our consciousness is taken up, is what constitutes the qualitative character of our feelings, perceptions, fancies, and ideas; of our aims and duties; and of our thoughts and notions. From this point of view, feeling, perception, etc., are the _**forms**_ assumed by these contents. The contents remain one and the same, whether they are felt, seen, represented, or willed, and whether they are merely felt, or felt with an admixture of thoughts, or merely and simply thought. In any one of these forms, or in the admixture of several, the contents confront consciousness, or are its _**object**_. But when they are thus objects of consciousness, the modes of the several forms ally themselves with the contents; and each form of them appears in consequence to give rise to a special object. Thus what is the same at bottom may look like a different sort of fact.

The several modes of feeling, perception, desire, and will, so far as we are _**aware**_ of them, are in general called ideas (mental representations): and it may be roughly said that philosophy puts thoughts, categories, or, in more precise language, adequate _**notions**_, in the place of the generalised images we ordinarily call ideas. Mental impressions such as these may be regarded as the metaphors of thoughts and notions. But to have these figurate conceptions does not imply that we appreciate their intellectual significance, the thoughts and rational notions to which they correspond. Conversely, it is one thing to have thoughts and intelligent notions, and another to know what impressions, perceptions, and feelings correspond to them.

This difference will to some extent explain what people call the unintelligibility of philosophy. Their difficulty lies partly in an incapacity — which in itself is nothing but want of habit — for abstract thinking; i.e. in an inability to get hold of pure thoughts and move about in them. In our ordinary state of mind, the thoughts are clothed upon and made one with the sensuous or spiritual material of the hour; and in reflection, meditation, and general reasoning, we introduce a blend of thoughts into feelings, percepts, and mental images. (Thus, in propositions where the subject-matter is due to the senses — e.g. ‘This leaf is green’ — we have such categories introduced, as being and individuality.) But it is a very different thing to make the thoughts pure and simple our object.

But their complaint that philosophy is unintelligible is as much due to another reason; and that is an impatient wish to have before them as a mental picture that which is in the mind as a thought or notion. When people are asked to apprehend some notion, they often complain that they do not know what they have to think. But the fact is that in a notion there is nothing further to be thought than the notion itself. What the phrase reveals is a hankering after an image with which we are already familiar. The mind, denied the use of its familiar ideas, feels the ground where it once stood firm and at home taken away from beneath it, and, when transported into the region of pure thought, cannot tell where in the world it is.

One consequence of this weakness is that authors, preachers, and orators are found most intelligible, when they speak of things which their readers or hearers already know by rote — things which the latter are conversant with, and which require no explanation.

§ 4

The philosopher then has to reckon with popular modes of thought, and with the objects of religion. In dealing with the ordinary modes of mind, he will first of all, as we saw, have to prove and almost to awaken the need for his peculiar method of knowledge. In dealing with the objects of religion, and with truth as a whole, he will have to show that philosophy is capable of apprehending them from its own resources; and should a difference from religious conceptions come to light, he will have to justify the points in which it diverges.

§ 5

To give the reader a preliminary explanation of the distinction thus made, and to let him see at the same moment that the real import of our consciousness is retained, and even for the first time put in its proper light, when translated into the form of thought and the notion of reason, it may be well to recall another of these old unreasoned beliefs. And that is the conviction that to get at the truth of any object or event, even of feelings, perceptions, opinions, and mental ideas, we must think it over. Now in any case to think things over is at least to transform feelings, ordinary ideas, etc. into thoughts.

Nature has given every one a faculty of thought. But thought is all that philosophy claims as the form proper to her business: and thus the inadequate view which ignores the distinction stated in §3 leads to a new delusion, the reverse of the complaint previously mentioned about the unintelligibility of philosophy. In other words, this science must often submit to the slight of hearing even people who have never taken any trouble with it talking as if they thoroughly understood all about it. With no preparation beyond an ordinary education they do not hesitate, especially under the influence of religious sentiment, to philosophise and to criticise philosophy. Everybody allows that to know any other science you must have first studied it, and that you can only claim to express a judgment upon it in virtue of such knowledge. Everybody allows that to make a shoe you must have learned and practised the craft of the shoemaker, though every man has a model in his own foot, and possesses in his hands the natural endowments for the operations required. For philosophy alone, it seems to be imagined, such study, care, and application are not in the least requisite.

This comfortable view of what is required for a philosopher has recently received corroboration through the theory of immediate or intuitive knowledge.

§ 6

So much for the form of philosophical knowledge. It is no less desirable, on the other hand, that philosophy should understand that its content is no other than _**actuality**_, that core of truth which, originally produced and producing itself within the precincts of the mental life, has become the _**world**_, the inward and outward world, of consciousness. At first we become aware of these contents in what we call Experience. But even Experience, as it surveys the wide range of inward and outward existence, has sense enough to distinguish the mere appearance, which is transient and meaningless, from what in itself really deserves the name of actuality. As it is only in form that philosophy is distinguished from other modes of attaining an acquaintance with this same sum of being, it must necessarily be in harmony with actuality and experience. In fact, this harmony may be viewed as at least an extrinsic means of testing the truth of a philosophy. Similarly it may be held the highest and final aim of philosophic science to bring about, through the ascertainment of this harmony, a reconciliation of the self-conscious reason with the reason which _is_ in the world — in other words, with actuality.

In the [Preface](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm#xxvii) to my _Philosophy of Right_, p. xix, are found the propositions:

What is reasonable is actual  
and  
What is actual is reasonable.

These simple statements have given rise to expressions of surprise and hostility, even in quarters where it would be reckoned an insult to presume absence of philosophy, and still more of religion. Religion at least need not be brought in evidence; its doctrines of the divine governments of the world affirm these propositions too decidedly. For their philosophic sense, we must presuppose intelligence enough to know, not only that God is actual, that He is the supreme actuality, that He alone is truly actual; but also, as regards the logical bearings of the question, that existence is in part mere appearance, and only in part actuality. In common life, any freak of fancy, any error, evil and everything of the nature of evil, as well as every degenerate and transitory existence whatever, gets in a casual way the name of actuality. But even our ordinary feelings are enough to forbid a casual (fortuitous) existence getting the emphatic name of an actual; for by fortuitous we mean an existence which has no greater value than that of something possible, which may as well not be as be. As for the term Actuality, these critics would have done well to consider the sense in which I employ it. In a detailed Logic I had treated among other things of actuality, and accurately distinguished it not only from the fortuitous, which, after all, has existence, but even from the cognate categories of existence and the other modifications of being.

The actuality of the rational stands opposed by the popular fancy that Ideas and ideals are nothing but chimeras, and philosophy a mere system of such phantasms. It is also opposed by the very different fancy that Ideas and ideals are something far too excellent to have actuality, or something too impotent to procure it for themselves. This divorce between idea and reality is especially dear to the analytic understanding which looks upon its own abstractions, dreams though they are, as something true and real, and prides itself on the imperative ‘ought’, which it takes especial pleasure in prescribing even on the field of politics. As if the world had waited on it to learn how it ought to be, and was not! For, if it were as it ought to be, what would come of the precocious wisdom of that ‘ought’? When understanding turns this ‘ought’ against trivial external and transitory objects, against social regulations or conditions, which very likely possess a great relative importance for a certain time and special circles, it may often be right. In such a case the intelligent observer may meet much that fails to satisfy the general requirements of right; for who is not acute enough to see a great deal in his own surroundings which is really far from being as it ought to be? But such acuteness is mistaken in the conceit that, when it examines these objects and pronounces what they ought to be, it is dealing with questions of philosophic science. The object of philosophy is the Idea: and the Idea is not so impotent as merely to have a right or an obligation to exist without actually existing. The object of philosophy is an actuality of which those objects, social regulations and conditions, are only the superficial outside.

§ 7

Thus reflection — thinking things over — in a general way involves the principle (which also means the beginning) of philosophy. And when the reflective spirit arose again in its independence in modern times, after the epoch of the Lutheran Reformation, it did not, as in its beginnings among the Greeks, stand merely aloof, in a world of its own, but at once turned its energies also upon the apparently illimitable material of the phenomenal world. In this way the name philosophy came to be applied to all those branches of knowledge, which are engaged in ascertaining the standard and Universal in the ocean of empirical individualities, as well as in ascertaining the Necessary element, or Laws, to be found in the apparent disorder of the endless masses of the fortuitous. It thus appears that modern philosophy derives its materials from our own personal observations and perceptions of the external and internal world, from nature as well as from the mind and heart of man, when both stand in the immediate presence of the observer.

This principle of Experience carries with it the unspeakably important condition that, in order to accept and believe any fact, we must be in contact with it; or, in more exact terms, that we must find the fact united and combined with the certainty of our own selves. We must be in touch with our subject-matter, whether it be by means of our external senses, or, else, by our profounder mind and our intimate self-consciousness. This principle is the same as that which has in the present day been termed faith, immediate knowledge, the revelation in the outward world, and, above all, in our own heart.

Those sciences, which thus got the name of philosophy, we call _empirical_ sciences, for the reason that they take their departure from experience. Still the essential results which they aim at and provide are laws, general propositions, a theory — the thoughts of what is found existing. On this ground the Newtonian physics was called Natural Philosophy. [Hugo Grotius](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hpgrotiu.htm), again, by putting together and comparing the behaviour of states towards each other as recorded in history, succeeded, with the help of the ordinary methods of general reasoning, in laying down certain general principles, and establishing a theory which may be termed the Philosophy of International Law. In England this is still the usual signification of the term philosophy. Newton continues to be celebrated as the greatest of philosophers: and the name goes down as far as the price-lists of instrument-makers. All instruments, such as the thermometer and barometer, which do not come under the special head of magnetic or electric apparatus, are styled philosophical instruments. Surely _thought_, and not a mere combination of wood, iron, etc., ought to be called the instrument of philosophy! The recent science of Political Economy in particular, which in Germany is known as Rational Economy of the State, or intelligent national economy, has in England especially appropriated the name of philosophy.

§ 8

In its own field this empirical knowledge may at first give satisfaction; but in two ways it is seen to come short. In the first place there is another circle of objects which it does not embrace. These are Freedom, Spirit, and God. They belong to a different sphere, not because it can be said that they have nothing to do with experience; for though they are certainly not experiences of the senses, it is quite an identical proposition to say that whatever is in consciousness is experienced. The real ground for assigning them to another field of cognition is that in their scope and _**content**_ these objects evidently show themselves as infinite.

There is an old phrase often wrongly attributed to Aristotle, and supposed to express the general tenor of his philosophy. _Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu_: there is nothing in thought which has not been in sense and experience. If speculative philosophy refused to admit this maxim, it can only have done so from a misunderstanding. It will, however, on the converse side no less assert: _Nihil est in sensu quod! non fuerit in intellectu_. And this may be taken in two senses. In the general sense it means that νους or spirit (the more profound idea of νους in modern thought) is the cause of the world. In its special meaning (see § 2) it asserts that the sentiment of right, morals, and religion is a sentiment (and in that way an experience) of such scope and such character that it can spring from and rest upon thought alone.

§ 9

But in the second place in point of form the subjective reason desires a further satisfaction than empirical knowledge gives; and this form is, in the widest sense of the term, Necessity (§ 1). The method of empirical science exhibits two defects.  
The first is that the Universal or general principle contained in it, the genus, or kind, etc., is, on its own account, indeterminate and vague, and therefore not on its own account connected with the Particulars or the details. Either is external and accidental to the other; and it is the same with the particular facts which are brought into union: each is external and accidental to the others.  
The second defect is that the beginnings are in every case data and postulates, neither accounted for nor deduced. In both these points the form of necessity fails to get its due. Hence reflection, whenever it sets itself to remedy these defects, becomes speculative thinking, the thinking proper to philosophy. As a species of reflection, therefore, which, though it has a certain community of nature with the reflection already mentioned, is nevertheless different from it, philosophic thought thus possesses, in addition to the common forms, some forms of its own, of which the Notion may be taken as the type.

The relation of speculative science to the other sciences may be stated in the following terms. It does not in the least neglect the empirical facts contained in the several sciences, but recognises and adopts them: it appreciates and applies towards its own structure the universal element in these sciences, their laws and classifications: but besides all this, into the categories of science it introduces, and gives currency to, other categories. The difference, looked at in this way, is only a change of categories. Speculative Logic contains all previous Logic and Metaphysics: it preserves the same forms of thought, the same laws and objects — while at the same time remodelling and expanding them with wider categories.

From _**notion**_ in the speculative sense we should distinguish what is ordinarily called a notion. The phrase, that no notion can ever comprehend the Infinite, a phrase which has been repeated over and over again till it has grown axiomatic, is based upon this narrow estimate of what is meant by notions.

§ 10

This thought, which is proposed as the instrument of philosophic knowledge, itself calls for further explanation. We must understand in what way it possesses necessity or cogency: and when it claims to be equal to the task of apprehending the absolute objects (God, Spirit, Freedom), that claim must be substantiated. Such an explanation, however, is itself a lesson in philosophy, and properly falls within the scope of the science itself. A preliminary attempt to make matters plain would only be unphilosophical, and consist of a tissue of assumptions, assertions, and inferential pros and cons, i.e. of dogmatism without cogency, as against which there would be an equal right of counter-dogmatism.

A main line of argument in the [Critical Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/k/a.htm#kant-immanuel) bids us pause before proceeding to inquire into God or into the true being of things, and tells us first of all to examine the faculty of cognition and see whether it is equal to such an effort. We ought, says Kant, to become acquainted with the instrument, before we undertake the work for which it is to be employed; for if the instrument be insufficient, all our trouble will be spent in vain. The plausibility of this suggestion has won for it general assent and admiration; the result of which has been to withdraw cognition from an interest in its objects and absorption in the study of them, and to direct it back upon itself; and so turn it to a question of form. Unless we wish to be deceived by words, it is easy to see what this amounts to. In the case of other instruments, we can try and criticise them in other ways than by setting about the special work for which they are destined. But the examination of knowledge can only be carried out by an act of knowledge. To examine this so-called instrument is the same thing as to know it. But to seek to know before we know is as absurd as the wise resolution of Scholasticus, not to venture into the water until he had learned to swim.

Reinhold saw the confusion with which this style of commencement is chargeable, and tried to get out of the difficulty by starting with a hypothetical and problematical stage of philosophising. In this way he supposed that it would be possible, nobody can tell how, to get along, until we found ourselves, further on, arrived at the primary truth of truths. His method, when closely looked into, will be seen to be identical with a very common practice. It starts from a substratum of experiential fact, or from a provisional assumption which has been brought into a definition; and then proceeds to analyse this starting-point. We can detect in Reinhold’s argument a perception of the truth, that the usual course which proceeds by assumptions and anticipations is no better than a hypothetical and problematical mode of procedure. But his perceiving this does not alter the character of this method; it only makes clear its imperfections.

§ 11

The special conditions which call for the existence of philosophy may be thus described. The mind or spirit, when it is sentient or perceptive, finds its object in something sensuous; when it imagines, in a picture or image; when it wills, in an aim or end. But in contrast to, or it may be only in distinction from, these forms of its existence and of its objects, the mind has also to gratify the cravings of its highest and most inward life. That innermost self is thought. Thus the mind renders thought its object. In the best meaning of the phrase, it comes to itself; for thought is its principle, and its very unadulterated self. But while thus occupied, thought entangles itself in contradictions, i.e. loses itself in the hard-and-fast non-identity of its thoughts, and so, instead of reaching itself, is caught and held in its counterpart. This result, to which honest but narrow thinking leads the mere understanding, is resisted by the loftier craving of which we have spoken. That craving expresses the perseverance of thought, which continues true to itself, even in this conscious loss of its native rest and independence, ‘that it may overcome’ and work out in itself the solution of its own contradictions.

To see that thought in its very nature is dialectical, and that, as understanding, it must fall into contradiction — the negative of itself — will form one of the main lessons of logic. When thought grows hopeless of ever achieving, by its own means, the solution of the contradiction which it has by its own action brought upon itself, it turns back to those solutions of the question with which the mind had learned to pacify itself in some of its other modes and forms. Unfortunately, however, the retreat of thought has led it, as Plato noticed even in his time, to a very uncalled-for hatred of reason (misology); and it then takes up against its own endeavours that hostile attitude of which an example is seen in the doctrine that ‘immediate’ knowledge, as it is called, is the exclusive form in which we become cognisant of truth.

§ 12

The rise of philosophy is due to these cravings of thought. Its point of departure is Experience; including under that name both our immediate consciousness and the inductions from it. Awakened, as it were, by this stimulus, thought is vitally characterised by raising itself above the natural state of mind, above the senses and inferences from the senses into its own unadulterated element, and by assuming, accordingly, at first a stand-aloof and negative attitude towards the point from which it started. Through this state of antagonism to the phenomena of sense its first satisfaction is found in itself, in the Idea of the universal essence of these phenomena: an Idea (the Absolute, or God) which may be more or less abstract. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the sciences, based on experience, exert upon the mind a stimulus to overcome the form in which their varied contents are presented, and to elevate these contents to the rank of necessary truth. For the facts of science have the aspect of a vast conglomerate, one thing coming side by side with another, as if they were merely given and presented — as in short devoid of all essential or necessary connection. In consequence of this stimulus, thought is dragged out of its unrealised universality and its fancied or merely possible satisfaction, and impelled onwards to a development from itself. On one hand this development only means that thought incorporates the contents of science, in all their speciality of detail as submitted. On the other it makes these contents imitate the action of the original creative thought, and present the aspect of a free evolution determined by the logic of the fact alone.

On the relation between ‘immediacy’ and ‘mediation’ in consciousness we shall speak later, expressly and with more detail. Here it may be sufficient to premise that, though the two ‘moments’ or factors present themselves as distinct, still neither of them can be absent, nor can one exist apart from the other. Thus the knowledge of God, as of every supersensible reality, is in its true character an exaltation above sensations or perceptions: it consequently involves a negative attitude to the initial data of sense, and to that extent implies mediation. For to mediate is to take something as a beginning and to go onward to a second thing; so that the existence of this second thing depends on our having reached it from something else contradistinguished from it. In spite of this, the knowledge of God is no mere sequel, dependent on the empirical phase of consciousness: in fact, its independence is essentially secured through this negation and exaltation. No doubt, if we attach an unfair prominence to the fact of mediation, and represent it as implying a state of conditionedness, it may be said — not that the remark would mean much — that philosophy is the child of experience, and owes its rise to _a posteriori_ fact. (As a matter of fact, thinking is always the negation of what we have immediately before us.) With as much truth however we may be said to owe eating to the means of nourishment, so long as we can have no eating without them. If we take this view, eating is certainly represented as ungrateful: it devours that to which it owes itself. Thinking, upon this view of its action, is equally ungrateful.

But there is also an _a priori_ aspect of thought, where by a mediation, not made by anything external but by a reflection into self, we have that immediacy which is universality, the selfcomplacency of thought which is so much at home with itself that it feels an innate indifference to descend to particulars, and in that way to the development of its own nature. It is thus also with religion, which whether it be rude or elaborate, whether it be invested with scientific precision of detail or confined to the simple faith of the heart, possesses, throughout, the same intensive nature of contentment and felicity. But if thought never gets further than the universality of the Ideas, as was perforce the case in the first philosophies (when the [Eleatics](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/glossary.htm#eleatics) never got beyond Being, or Heraclitus beyond Becoming), it is justly open to the charge of formalism. Even in a more advanced phase of philosophy, we may often find a doctrine which has mastered merely certain abstract propositions or formulae, such as, ‘In the absolute all is one’, ‘Subject and object are identical’ — and only repeating the same thing when it comes to particulars. Bearing in mind this first period of thought, the period of mere generality, we may safely say that experience is the real author of _**growth**_ and _**advance**_ in philosophy. For, firstly, the empirical sciences do not stop short at the mere observation of the individual features of a phenomenon. By the aid of thought, they are able to meet philosophy with materials prepared for it, in the shape of general uniformities, i.e. laws, and classifications of the phenomena. When this is done, the particular facts which they contain are ready to be received into philosophy. This, secondly, implies a certain compulsion on thought itself to proceed to these concrete specific truths. The reception into philosophy of these scientific materials, now that thought has removed their immediacy and made them cease to be mere data, forms at the same time a development of thought out of itself. Philosophy, then, owes its development to the empirical sciences. In return it gives their contents what is so vital to them, the freedom of thought — gives them, in short, an _a priori_ character. These contents are now warranted necessary, and no longer depend on the evidence of facts merely, that they were so found and so experienced. The fact as experienced thus becomes an illustration and a copy of the original and completely self-supporting activity of thought.

§ 13

Stated in exact terms, such is the origin and development of philosophy. But the History of Philosophy gives us the same process from a historical and external point of view. The stages in the evolution of the Idea there seem to follow each other by accident, and to present merely a number of different and unconnected principles, which the several systems of philosophy carry out in their own way. But it is not so. For these thousands of years the same Architect has directed the work: and that Architect is the one living Mind whose nature is to think, to bring to self-consciousness what it is, and, with its being thus set as object before it, to be at the same time raised above it, and so to reach a higher stage of its own being. The different systems which the history of philosophy presents are therefore not irreconcilable with unity.

We may either say, that it is one philosophy at different degrees of maturity: or that the particular principle, which is the groundwork of each system, is but a branch of one and the same universe of thought. In philosophy the latest birth of time is the result of all the systems that have preceded it, and must include their principles; and so, if, on other grounds, it deserve the title of philosophy, will be the fullest, most comprehensive, and most adequate system of all.

The spectacle of so many and so various systems of philosophy suggests the necessity of defining more exactly the relation of Universal to Particular. When the universal is made a mere form and co-ordinated with the particular, as if it were on the same level, it sinks into a particular itself. Even common sense in everyday matters is above the absurdity of setting a universal _**beside**_ the particulars. Would any one, who wished for fruit, reject cherries, pears, and grapes, on the ground that they were cherries, pears, or grapes, and not fruit? But when philosophy is in question, the excuse of many is that philosophies are so different, and none of them is the philosophy — that each is only a philosophy. Such a plea is assumed to justify any amount of contempt for philosophy. And yet cherries too are fruit. Often, too, a system, of which the principle is the universal, is put on a level with another of which the principle is a particular, and with theories which deny the existence of philosophy altogether. Such systems are said to be only different views of philosophy. With equal justice, light and darkness might be styled different kinds of light.

§ 14

The same evolution of thought which is exhibited in the history of philosophy is presented in the System of Philosophy itself. Here, instead of surveying the process, as we do in history, from the outside, we see the movement of thought clearly defined in its native medium. The thought, which is genuine and self-supporting, must be intrinsically concrete; it must be an Idea; and when it is viewed in the whole of its universality, it is the Idea, or the Absolute. The science of this Idea must form a system. For the truth is concrete; that is, while it gives a bond and principle of unity, it also possesses an internal source of development. Truth, then, is only possible as a universe or totality of thought; and the freedom of the whole, as well as the necessity of the several sub-divisions, which it implies, are only possible when these are discriminated and defined.

Unless it is a system, a philosophy is not a scientific production. Unsystematic philosophising can only be expected to give expression to personal peculiarities of mind, and has no principle for the regulation of its contents. Apart from their interdependence and organic union, the truths of philosophy are valueless, and must then be treated as baseless hypotheses, or personal convictions. Yet many philosophical treatises confine themselves to such an exposition of the opinions and sentiments of the author.

The term system is often misunderstood. It does not denote a philosophy, the principle of which is narrow and to be distinguished from others. On the contrary, a genuine philosophy makes it a principle to include every particular principle.

§ 15

_Each of the parts of philosophy is a philosophical whole, a circle rounded and complete in itself_. In each of these parts, however, the philosophical Idea is found in a particular specificality or medium. The single circle, because it is a real totality, bursts through the limits imposed by its special medium, and gives rise to a wider circle. The whole of philosophy in this way resembles a _circle of circles_. The Idea appears in each single circle, but, at the same time, the whole Idea is constituted by the system of these peculiar phases, and each is a necessary member of the organisation.

§ 16

In the form of an Encyclopaedia, the science has no room for a detailed exposition of particulars, and must be limited to setting forth the commencement of the special sciences and the notions of cardinal importance in them.

How much of the particular parts is requisite to constitute a particular branch of knowledge is so far indeterminate, that the part, if it is to be something true, must be not an isolated member merely, but itself an organic whole. The entire field of philosophy therefore really forms a single science; but it may also be viewed as a total, composed of several particular sciences.

The encyclopaedia of philosophy must not be confounded with ordinary encyclopaedias. An ordinary encyclopaedia does not pretend to be more than an aggregation of sciences, regulated by no principle, and merely as experience offers them. Sometimes it even includes what merely bear the name of sciences, while they are nothing more than a collection of bits of information. In an aggregate like this, the several branches of knowledge owe their place in the encyclopaedia to extrinsic reasons, and their unity is therefore artificial: they are _**arranged**_, but we cannot say they form a _**system**_. For the same reason, especially as the materials to be combined also depend upon no one rule or principle, the arrangement is at best an experiment, and will always exhibit inequalities.

An encyclopaedia of philosophy excludes three kinds of partial science. I. It excludes mere aggregates of bits of information. Philology in its prima facie aspect belongs to this class. II. It rejects the quasi-sciences, which are founded on an act of arbitrary will alone, such as Heraldry. Sciences of this class are positive from beginning to end. III. In another class of sciences, also styled positive, but which have a rational basis and a rational beginning, philosophy claims that constituent as its own. The positive features remain the property of the sciences themselves.

The positive element in the last class of sciences is of different sorts. (i) Their commencement, though rational at bottom, yields to the influence of fortuitousness, when they have to bring their universal truth into contact with actual facts and the single phenomena of experience. In this region of chance and change, the adequate notion of science must yield its place to reasons or grounds of explanation. Thus, e.g. in the science of jurisprudence, or in the system of direct and indirect taxation, it is necessary to have certain points precisely and definitively settled which lie beyond the competence of the absolute lines laid down by the pure notion. A certain latitude of settlement accordingly is left; and each point may be determined in one way on one principle, in another way on another, and admits of no definitive certainty. Similarly the Idea of Nature, when parcelled out in detail, is dissipated into contingencies. Natural history, geography, and medicine stumble upon descriptions of existence, upon kinds and distinctions, which are not determined by reason, but by sport and adventitious incidents. Even history comes under the same category. The Idea is its essence and inner nature; but, as it appears, everything is under contingency and in the field of voluntary action. (ii) These sciences are positive also in failing to recognise the finite nature of what they predicate, and to point out how these categories and their whole sphere pass into a higher. They assume their statements to possess an authority beyond appeal. Here the fault lies in the finitude of the form, as in the previous instance it lay in the matter. (iii) In close sequel to this, sciences are positive in consequence of the inadequate grounds on which their conclusions rest: based as these are on detached and casual inference, upon feeling, faith, and authority, and, generally speaking, upon the deliverances of inward and outward perception. Under this head we must also class the philosophy which proposes to build upon ‘anthropology’, facts of consciousness, inward sense, or outward experience. It may happen, however, that empirical is an epithet applicable only to the form of scientific exposition, while intuitive sagacity has arranged what are mere phenomena, according to the essential sequence of the notion. In such a case the contrasts between the varied and numerous phenomena brought together serve to eliminate the external and accidental circumstances of their conditions, and the universal thus comes clearly into view. Guided by such an intuition, experimental physics will present the rational science of Nature — as history will present the science of human affairs and actions — in an external picture, which mirrors the philosophic notion.

§ 17

It may seem as if philosophy, in order to start on its course, had, like the rest of the sciences, to begin with a subjective presupposition. The sciences postulate their respective objects, such as space, number, or whatever it be; and it might be supposed that philosophy had also to postulate the existence of thought. But the two cases are not exactly parallel. It is by the free act of thought that it occupies a point of view, in which it is for its own self, and thus gives itself an object of its own production. Nor is this all. The very point of view, which originally is taken on its own evidence only, must in the course of the science be converted to a result — the ultimate result in which philosophy returns into itself and reaches the point with which it began. In this manner philosophy exhibits the appearance of a circle which closes with itself, and has no beginning in the same way as the other sciences have. To speak of a beginning of philosophy has a meaning only in relation to a person who proposes to commence the study, and not in relation to the science as science. The same thing may be thus expressed. The notion of science — the notion therefore with which we start — which, for the very reason that it is initial, implies a separation between the thought which is our object, and the subject philosophising which is, as it were, external to the former, must be grasped and comprehended by the science itself. This is in short, the one single aim, action, and goal of philosophy — to arrive at the notion of its notion, and thus secure its return and its satisfaction.

§ 18

As the whole science, and only the whole, can exhibit what the Idea or system of reason is, it is impossible to give in a preliminary way a general impression of a philosophy. Nor can a division of philosophy into its parts be intelligible, except in connection with the system. A preliminary division, like the limited conception from which it comes, can only be an anticipation. Here however it is premised that the Idea turns out to be the thought which is completely identical with itself, and not identical simply in the abstract, but also in its action of setting itself over against itself, so as to gain a being of its own, and yet of being in full possession of itself while it is in this other. Thus philosophy is subdivided into three parts:

I. [Logic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm): the science of the Idea in and for itself.  
II. The [Philosophy of Nature](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/na/nature.htm): the science of the Idea in its otherness.  
III. The [Philosophy of Mind](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sp/ssintrod.htm): the science of the Idea come back to itself out of that otherness.

As observed in §15, the differences between the several philosophical sciences are only aspects or specialisations of the one Idea or system of reason, which and which alone is alike exhibited in these different media. In Nature nothing else would have to be discerned, except the Idea; but the Idea has here divested itself of its proper being. In Mind, again, the Idea has asserted a being of its own, and is on the way to become absolute. Every such form in which the Idea is expressed is at the same time a passing or fleeting stage; and hence each of these subdivisions has not only to know its contents as an object which has being for the time, but also in the same act to expound how these contents pass into their higher circle. To represent the relation between them as a division, therefore, leads to misconception; for it co-ordinates the several parts or sciences one beside another, as if they had no innate development, but were, like so many species, really and radically distinct.

The Phenomenology of Mind

# PREFACE  
On scientific knowledge

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p1) [1.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m001) In the case of a philosophical work it seems not only superfluous, but, in view of the nature of philosophy, even inappropriate and misleading to begin, as writers usually do in a preface, by explaining the end the author had in mind, the circumstances which gave rise to the work, and the relation in which the writer takes it to stand to other treatises on the same subject, written by his predecessors or his contemporaries. For whatever it might be suitable to state about philosophy in a preface – say, an historical sketch of the main drift and point of view, the general content and results, a string of desultory assertions and assurances about the truth – this cannot be accepted as the form and manner in which to expound philosophical truth.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p2) [2.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m002) Moreover, because philosophy has its being essentially in the element of that universality which encloses the particular within it, the end or final result seems, in the case of philosophy more than in that of other sciences, to have absolutely expressed the complete fact itself in its very nature; contrasted with that the mere process of bringing it to light would seem, properly speaking, to have no essential significance. On the other hand, in the general idea of e.g. anatomy – the knowledge of the parts of the body regarded as lifeless – we are quite sure we do not possess the objective concrete fact, the actual content of the science, but must, over and above, be concerned with particulars. Further, in the case of such a collection of items of knowledge, which has no real right to the name of science, any talk about purpose and suchlike generalities is not commonly very different from the descriptive and superficial way in which the contents of the science these nerves and muscles, etc. – are themselves spoken of. In philosophy, on the other hand, it would at once be felt incongruous were such a method made use of and yet shown by philosophy itself to be incapable of grasping the truth.

In the same way too, by determining the relation which a philosophical work professes to have to other treatises on the same subject, an extraneous interest is introduced, and obscurity is thrown over the point at issue in the knowledge of the truth. The more the ordinary mind takes the opposition between true and false to be fixed, the more is it accustomed to expect either agreement or contradiction with a given philosophical system, and only to see reason for the one or the other in any explanatory statement concerning such a system. It does not conceive the diversity of philosophical systems as the progressive evolution of truth; rather, it sees only contradiction in that variety. The bud disappears when the blossom breaks through, and we might say that the former is refuted by the latter; in the same way when the fruit comes, the blossom may be explained to be a false form of the plant’s existence, for the fruit appears as its true nature in place of the blossom. These stages are not merely differentiated; they supplant one another as being incompatible with one another. But the ceaseless activity of their own inherent nature makes them at the same time moments of an organic unity, where they not merely do not contradict one another, but where one is as necessary as the other; and this equal necessity of all moments constitutes alone and thereby the life of the whole. But contradiction as between philosophical systems is not wont to be conceived in this way; on the other hand, the mind perceiving the contradiction does not commonly know how to relieve it or keep it free from its one-sidedness, and to recognise in what seems conflicting and inherently antagonistic the presence of mutually necessary moments.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p3) [3.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m003) The demand for such explanations, as also the attempts to satisfy this demand, very easily pass for the essential business philosophy has to undertake. Where could the inmost truth of a philosophical work be found better expressed than in its purposes and results? and in what way could these be more definitely known than through their distinction from what is produced during the same period by others working in the same field? If, however, such procedure is to pass for more than the beginning of knowledge, if it is to pass for actually knowing, then we must, in point of fact, look on it as a device for avoiding the real business at issue, an attempt to combine the appearance of being in earnest and taking trouble about the subject with an actual neglect of the subject altogether. For the real subject-matter is not exhausted in its purpose, but in working the matter out; nor is the mere result attained the concrete whole itself, but the result along with the process of arriving at it. The purpose of itself is a lifeless universal, just as the general drift is a mere activity in a certain direction, which is still without its concrete realisation; and the naked result is the corpse of the system which has left its guiding tendency behind it. Similarly, the distinctive difference of anything is rather the boundary, the limit, of the subject; it is found at that point where the subject-matter stops, or it is what this subject-matter is _not_. To trouble oneself in this fashion with the purpose and results, and again with the differences, the positions taken up and judgments passed by one thinker and another, is therefore an easier task than perhaps it seems. For instead of laying hold of the matter in hand, a procedure of that kind is all the while away from the subject altogether. Instead of dwelling within it and becoming absorbed by it, knowledge of that sort is always grasping at something else; such knowledge, instead keeping to the subject-matter and giving itself up to it, never gets away from itself. The easiest thing of all is to pass judgments on what has a solid substantial content; it is more difficult to grasp it, and most of all difficult to do both together and produce the systematic exposition of it.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p4) [4.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m004) The beginning of culture and of the struggle to pass out of the unbroken immediacy of naive psychical life has always to be made by acquiring knowledge of universal principles and points of view, by striving, in the first instance, to work up simply to the _thought_ of the subject-matter in general, not forgetting at the same time to give reasons for supporting it or refuting it, to apprehend the concrete riches and fullness contained in its various determinate qualities, and to know how to furnish a coherent, orderly account of it and a responsible judgment upon it. This beginning of mental cultivation will, however, very soon make way for the earnestness of actual life in all its fullness, which leads to a living experience of the subject-matter itself; and when, in addition, conceptual thought strenuously penetrates to the very depths of its meaning, such knowledge and style of judgment will keep their due place in everyday thought and conversation.

#### 2. The element of truth is the Concept/Notion (_Begriff_), and its true form the scientific system

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p5) [5.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m005) The systematic development of truth in scientific form can alone be the true shape in which truth exists. To help to bring philosophy nearer to the form of science – that goal where it can lay aside the name of _love_ of knowledge and be actual knowledge – that is what I have set before me. The inner necessity that knowledge should be science lies in its very nature; and the adequate and sufficient explanation for this lies simply and solely in the systematic exposition of philosophy itself. The external necessity, however, so far as this is apprehended in a universal way, and apart from the accident of the personal element and the particular occasioning influences affecting the individual, is the same as the internal: it lies in the form and shape in which the process of time presents the existence of its moments. To show that the time process does raise philosophy to the level of scientific system would, therefore, be the only true justification of the attempts which aim at proving that philosophy must assume this character; because the temporal process would thus bring out and lay bare the necessity of it, nay, more, would at the same time be carrying out that very aim itself.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p6) [6.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m006) When we state the true form of truth to be its scientific character – or, what is the same thing, when it is maintained that truth finds the medium of its existence in notions or conceptions alone – I know that this seems to contradict an idea with all its consequences which makes great pretensions and has gained widespread acceptance and conviction at the present time. A word of explanation concerning this contradiction seems, therefore, not out of place, even though at this stage it can amount to no more than a dogmatic assurance exactly like the view we are opposing. If, that is to say, truth exists merely in what, or rather exists merely _as_ what, is called at one time intuition, at another immediate knowledge of the Absolute, Religion, Being – not being in the centre of divine love, but the very Being of this centre, of the Absolute itself – from that point of view it is rather the opposite of the notional or conceptual form which would be required for systematic philosophical exposition. The Absolute on this view is not to be grasped in conceptual form, but felt, intuited; it is not its conception, but the feeling of it and intuition of it that are to have the say and find expression.

#### 3. Present position of the spirit

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p7) [7.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m007) If we consider the appearance of a claim like this in its more general setting, and look at the level which the self-conscious mind at present occupies, we shall find that self-consciousness has got beyond the substantial fullness of life, which it used to carry on in the element of thought – beyond the state of immediacy of belief, beyond the satisfaction and security arising from the assurance which consciousness possessed of being reconciled with ultimate reality and with its all-pervading presence, within as well as without. Self-conscious mind has not merely passed beyond that to the opposite extreme of insubstantial reflection of self into self, but beyond this too. It has not merely lost its essential and concrete life, it is also conscious of this loss and of the transitory finitude characteristic of its content. Turning away from the husks it has to feed on, and confessing that it lies in wickedness and sin, it reviles itself for so doing, and now desires from philosophy not so much to bring it to a knowledge of what it is, as to obtain once again through philosophy the restoration of that sense of solidity and substantiality of existence it has lost. Philosophy is thus expected not so much to meet this want by opening up the compact solidity of substantial existence, and bringing this to the light and level of self-consciousness is not so much to bring chaotic conscious life back to the orderly ways of thought, and the simplicity of the notion, as to run together what thought has divided asunder suppress the notion with its distinctions, and restore the feeling of existence. What it wants from philosophy is not so much insight as edification. The beautiful, the holy, the eternal, religion, love – these are the bait required to awaken the desire to bite: not the notion, but ecstasy, not the march of cold necessity in the subject-matter, but ferment and enthusiasm – these are to be the ways by which the wealth of the concrete substance is to be stored and increasingly extended.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p8) [8.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m008) With this demand there goes the strenuous effort, almost perfervidly zealous in its activity, to rescue mankind from being sunken in what is sensuous, vulgar, and of fleeting importance, and to raise men’s eyes to the stars; as if men had quite forgotten the divine, and were on the verge of finding satisfaction, like worms, in mud and water. Time was when man had a heaven, decked and fitted out with endless wealth of thoughts and pictures. The significance of all that is, lay in the thread of light by which it was attached to heaven; instead of dwelling in the present as it is here and now, the eye glanced away over the present to the Divine, away, so to say, to a present that lies beyond. The mind’s gaze had to be directed under compulsion to what is earthly, and kept fixed there; and it has needed a long time to introduce that clearness, which only celestial realities had, into the crassness and confusion shrouding the sense of things earthly, and to make attention to the immediate present as such, which was called Experience, of interest and of value. Now we have apparently the need for the opposite of all this; man’s mind and interest are so deeply rooted in the earthly that we require a like power to have them raised above that level. His spirit shows such poverty of nature that it seems to long for the mere pitiful feeling of the divine in the abstract, and to get refreshment from that, like a wanderer in the desert craving for the merest mouthful of water. By the little which can thus satisfy the needs of the human spirit we can measure the extent of its loss.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p9) [9.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m009) This easy contentment in receiving, or stinginess in giving, does not suit the character of science. The man who only seeks edification, who wants to envelop in mist the manifold diversity of his earthly existence and thought, and craves after the vague enjoyment of this vague and indeterminate Divinity – he may look where he likes to find this: he will easily find for himself the means to procure something he can rave over and puff himself up withal. But philosophy must beware of wishing to be edifying.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p10) [10.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m010) Still less must this kind of contentment, which holds science in contempt, take upon itself to claim that raving obscurantism of this sort is something higher than science. These apocalyptic utterances pretend to occupy the very centre and the deepest depths; they look askance at all definiteness and preciseness of meaning; and they deliberately hold back from conceptual thinking and the constraining necessities of thought, as being the sort of reflection which, they say, can only feel at home in the sphere of finitude. But just as there is a breadth which is emptiness, there is a depth which is empty too: as we may have an extension of substance which overflows into finite multiplicity without the power of keeping the manifold together, in the same way we may have an insubstantial intensity which, keeping itself in as mere force without actual expression, is no better than superficiality. The force of mind is only as great as its expression; its depth only as deep as its power to expand and lose itself when spending and giving out its substance. Moreover, when this unreflective emotional knowledge makes a pretence of having immersed its own very self in the depths of the absolute Being, and of philosophizing in all holiness and truth, it hides from itself the fact that instead of devotion to God, it rather, by this contempt for all measurable precision and definiteness, simply attests in its own case the fortuitous character of its content, and in the other endows God with its own caprice. When such minds commit themselves to the unrestrained ferment of sheer emotion, they think that, by putting a veil over self-consciousness, and surrendering all understanding, they are thus God’s beloved ones to whom He gives His wisdom in sleep. This is the reason, too, that in point of fact, what they do conceive and bring forth in sleep is dreams.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p11) [11.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m011) For the rest it is not difficult to see that our epoch is a birth-time, and a period of transition. The spirit of man has broken with the old order of things hitherto prevailing, and with the old ways of thinking, and is in the mind to let them all sink into the depths of the past and to set about its own transformation. It is indeed never at rest, but carried along the stream of progress ever onward. But it is here as in the case of the birth of a child; after a long period of nutrition in silence, the continuity of the gradual growth in size, of quantitative change, is suddenly cut short by the first breath drawn – there is a break in the process, a qualitative change and the child is born. In like manner the spirit of the time, growing slowly and quietly ripe for the new form it is to assume, disintegrates one fragment after another of the structure of its previous world. That it is tottering to its fall is indicated only by symptoms here and there. Frivolity and again ennui, which are spreading in the established order of things, the undefined foreboding of something unknown – all these betoken that there is something else approaching. This gradual crumbling to pieces, which did not alter the general look and aspect of the whole, is interrupted by the sunrise, which, in a flash and at a single stroke, brings to view the form and structure of the new world.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p12) [12.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m012) But this new world is perfectly realised just as little as the new-born child; and it is essential to bear this in mind. It comes on the stage to begin with in its immediacy, in its bare generality. A building is not finished when its foundation is laid; and just as little, is the attainment of a general notion of a whole the whole itself. When we want to see an oak with all its vigour of trunk, its spreading branches, and mass of foliage, we are not satisfied to be shown an acorn instead. In the same way science, the crowning glory of a spiritual world, is not found complete in its initial stages. The beginning of the new spirit is the outcome of a widespread revolution in manifold forms of spiritual culture; it is the reward which comes after a chequered and devious course of development, and after much struggle and effort. It is a whole which, after running its course and laying bare all its content, returns again to itself; it is the resultant abstract notion of the whole. But the actual realisation of this abstract whole is only found when those previous shapes and forms, which are now reduced to ideal moments of the whole, are developed anew again, but developed and shaped within this new medium, and with the meaning they have thereby acquired.

#### 4. The principle is not the completion; against formalism

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p13) [13.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m013) While the new world makes its first appearance merely in general outline, merely as a whole lying concealed and hidden within a bare abstraction, the wealth of the bygone life, on the other hand, is still consciously present in recollection. Consciousness misses in the new form the detailed expanse of content; but still more the developed expression of form by which distinctions are definitely determined and arranged in their precise relations. Without this last feature science has no general intelligibility, and has the appearance of being an esoteric possession of a few individuals – an esoteric possession, because in the first instance it is only the essential principle or notion of science, only its inner nature that is to be found; and a possession of few individuals, because, at its first appearance, its content is not elaborated and expanded in detail, and thus its existence is turned into something particular. Only what is perfectly determinate in form is at the same time exoteric, comprehensible, and capable of being learned and possessed by everybody. Intelligibility is the form in which science is offered to everyone, and is the open road to it made plain for all. To reach rational knowledge by our intelligence is the just demand of the mind which comes to science. For intelligence, understanding (_Verstand_), is thinking, pure activity of the self in general; and what is intelligible (_Verständige_) is something from the first familiar and common to the scientific and unscientific mind alike, enabling the unscientific mind to enter the domain of science.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p14) [14.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m014) Science, at its commencement, when as yet it has reached neither detailed completeness nor perfection of form, is exposed to blame on that account. But it would be as unjust to suppose this blame to attach to its essential nature, as it is inadmissible not to be ready to recognise the demand for that further development in fuller detail. In the contrast and opposition between these two aspects (the initial and the developed stages of science) seems to lie the critical knot which scientific culture at present struggles to loosen, and about which so far it is not very clear. One side parades the wealth of its material and the intelligibility of its ideas; the other pours contempt at any rate on the latter, and makes a parade of the immediate intuitive rationality and divine quality of its content. Although the first is reduced to silence, perhaps by the inner force of truth alone, perhaps, too, by the noisy bluster of the other side, and even though having regard to the reason and nature of the case it did feel overborne, yet it does not therefore feel satisfied as regards those demands for greater development; for those demands are just, but still unfulfilled. Its silence is due only in part to the victory of the other side; it is half due to that weariness and indifference which are usually the consequence when expectations are being constantly awakened by promises which are not followed up by performance.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p15) [15.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m015) The other side no doubt at times makes an easy enough matter of having a vast expanse of content. They haul on to their territory a lot of material, that, namely, which is already familiar and arranged in order; and since they are concerned more especially about what is exceptional, strange, and curious, they seem all the more to be in possession of the rest, which knowledge in its own way was finished and done with, as well as to have control over what was unregulated and disorderly. Hence everything appears brought within the compass of the Absolute Idea, which seems thus to be recognised in everything, and to have succeeded in becoming a system _in extenso_ of scientific knowledge. But if we look more closely at this expanded system we find that it has not been reached by one and the same principle taking shape in diverse ways; it is the shapeless repetition of one and the same idea, which is applied in an external fashion to different material, the wearisome reiteration of it keeping up the semblance of diversity. The Idea, which by itself is no doubt the truth, really never gets any farther than just where it began, as long as the development of it consists in nothing else than such a repetition of the same formula. If the knowing subject carries round everywhere the one inert abstract form, taking up in external fashion whatever material comes his way, and dipping it into this element, then this comes about as near to fulfilling what is wanted – viz. a self-origination of the wealth of detail, and a self-determining distinction of shapes and forms – as any chance fancies about the content in question. It is rather a monochrome formalism, which only arrives at distinction in the matter it has to deal with, because this is already prepared and well known.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p16) [16.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m016) This monotonousness and abstract universality are maintained to be the Absolute. This formalism insists that to be dissatisfied therewith argues an incapacity to grasp the standpoint of the Absolute, and keep a firm hold on it. If it was once the case that the bare possibility of thinking of something in some other fashion was sufficient to refute a given idea, and the naked possibility, the bare general thought, possessed and passed for the entire substantive value of actual knowledge; similarly we find here all the value ascribed to the general idea in this bare form without concrete realisation; and we see here, too, the style and method of speculative contemplation identified with dissipating and, resolving what is determinate and distinct, or rather with hurling it down, without more ado and without any justification, into the abyss of vacuity. To consider any specific fact as it is in the Absolute, consists here in nothing else than saying about it that, while it is now doubtless spoken of as something specific, yet in the Absolute, in the abstract identity A = A, there is no such thing at all, for everything is there all one. To pit this single assertion, that “in the Absolute all is one”, against the organised whole of determinate and complete knowledge, or of knowledge which at least aims at and demands complete development – to give out its Absolute as the night in which, as we say, all cows are black – that is the very _naïveté_ of emptiness of knowledge.

The formalism which has been deprecated and despised by recent philosophy, and which has arisen once more in philosophy itself, will not disappear from science, even though its inadequacy is known and felt, till the knowledge of absolute reality has become quite clear as to what its own true nature consists in. Having in mind that the general idea of what is to be done, if it precedes the attempt to carry it out, facilitates the comprehension of this process, it is worth while to indicate here some rough idea of it, with the hope at the same time that this will give us the opportunity to set aside certain forms whose habitual presence is a hindrance in the way of speculative knowledge.

#### 5.   The absolute is subject –

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p17) [17.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m017) In my view – a view which the developed exposition of the system itself can alone justify – everything depends on grasping and expressing the ultimate truth not as Substance but as Subject as well. At the same time we must note that concrete substantiality implicates and involves the universal or the immediacy of knowledge itself, as well as that immediacy which is being, or immediacy _qua_ object _for_ knowledge. If the generation which heard God spoken of as the One Substance was shocked and revolted by such a characterisation of his nature, the reason lay partly in the instinctive feeling that in such a conception self-consciousness was simply submerged, and not preserved. But partly, again, the opposite position, which maintains thinking to be merely subjective thinking, abstract universality as such, is exactly the same bare uniformity, is undifferentiated, unmoved substantiality. And even if, in the third place, thought combines with itself the being of substance, and conceives immediacy or intuition (_Anschauung_) as thinking, it is still a question whether this intellectual intuition does not fall back into that inert, abstract simplicity, and exhibit and expound reality itself in an unreal manner.

#### 6.   – and what this is

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p18) [18.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m018) The living substance, further, is that being which is truly subject, or, what is the same thing, is truly realised and actual (_wirklich_) solely in the process of positing itself, or in mediating with its own self its transitions from one state or position to the opposite. As subject it is pure and simple negativity, and just on that account a process of splitting up what is simple and undifferentiated, a process of duplicating and setting factors in opposition, which [process] in turn is the negation of this indifferent diversity and of the opposition of factors it entails. True reality is merely this process of reinstating self-identity, of reflecting into its own self in and from its other, and is not an original and primal unity as such, not an immediate unity as such. It is the process of its own becoming, the circle which presupposes its end as its purpose, and has its end for its beginning; it becomes concrete and actual only by being carried out, and by the end it involves.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p19) [19.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m019) The life of God and divine intelligence, then, can, if we like, be spoken of as love disporting with itself; but this idea falls into edification, and even sinks into insipidity, if it lacks the seriousness, the suffering, the patience, and the labour of the negative. _Per se_ the divine life is no doubt undisturbed identity and oneness with itself, which finds no serious obstacle in otherness and estrangement, and none in the surmounting of this estrangement. But this “per se” is abstract generality, where we abstract from its real nature, which consists in its being objective, to itself, conscious of itself on its own account (_für sich zu sein_); and where consequently we neglect altogether the self-movement which is the formal character of its activity. If the form is declared to correspond to the essence, it is just for that reason a misunderstanding to suppose that knowledge can be content with the “per se”, the essence, but can do without the form, that the absolute principle, or absolute intuition, makes the carrying out of the former, or the development of the latter, needless. Precisely because the form is as necessary to the essence as the essence to itself, absolute reality must not be conceived of and expressed as essence alone, i.e. as immediate substance, or as pure self-intuition of the Divine, but as form also, and with the entire wealth of the developed form. Only then is it grasped and expressed as really actual.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p20) [20.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m020) The truth is the whole. The whole, however, is merely the essential nature reaching its completeness through the process of its own development. Of the Absolute it must be said that it is essentially a result, that only at the end is it what it is in very truth; and just in that consists its nature, which is to be actual, subject, or self-becoming, self-development. Should it appear contradictory to say that the Absolute has to be conceived essentially as a result, a little consideration will set this appearance of contradiction in its true light. The beginning, the principle, or the Absolute, as at first or immediately expressed, is merely the universal. If we say “all animals”, that does not pass for zoology; for the same reason we see at once that the words absolute, divine, eternal, and so on do not express what is implied in them; and only mere words like these, in point of fact, express intuition as the immediate. Whatever is more than a word like that, even the mere transition to a proposition, is a form of mediation, contains a process towards another state from which we must return once more. It is this process of mediation, however, that is rejected with horror, as if absolute knowledge were being surrendered when more is made of mediation than merely the assertion that it is nothing absolute, and does not exist in the Absolute.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p21) [21.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m021) This horrified rejection of mediation, however, arises as a fact from want of acquaintance with its nature, and with the nature of absolute knowledge itself. For mediating is nothing but self-identity working itself out through an active self-directed process; or, in other words, it is reflection into self, the aspect in which the ego is for itself, objective to itself. It is pure negativity, or, reduced to its utmost abstraction, the process of bare and simple becoming. The ego, or becoming in general, this process of mediating, is, because of its being simple, just immediacy coming to be, and is immediacy itself. We misconceive therefore the nature of reason if we exclude reflection or mediation from ultimate truth., and do not take it to be a positive moment of the Absolute. It is reflection which constitutes truth the final result, and yet at the same time does away with the contrast between result and the process of arriving at it. For this process is likewise simple, and therefore not distinct from the form of truth, which consists in appearing as simple in the result; it is indeed just this restoration and return to simplicity. While the embryo is certainly, in itself, implicitly a human being, it is not so explicitly, it is not by itself a human being (_für sich_); man is explicitly man only in the form of developed and cultivated reason, which has made itself to be what it is implicitly. Its actual reality is first found here. But this result arrived at is itself simple immediacy; for it is self conscious freedom, which is at one with itself, and has not set aside the opposition it involves and left it there, but has made its account with it and become reconciled to it.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p22) [22.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m022) What has been said may also be expressed by saying that reason is purposive activity. The exaltation of so-called nature at the expense of thought misconceived, and more especially the rejection of external purposiveness, have brought the idea of purpose in general into disrepute. All the same, in the sense in which Aristotle, too, characterises nature as purposive activity, purpose is the immediate, the undisturbed, the unmoved which is self-moving; as such it is subject. Its power of moving, taken abstractly, is its existence for itself, or pure negativity. The result is the same as the beginning solely because the beginning is purpose. Stated otherwise, what is actual and concrete is the same as its inner principle or notion simply because the immediate _qua_ purpose contains within it the self or pure actuality. The realised purpose, or concrete actuality, is movement and development unfolded. But this very unrest is the self; and it is one and the same with that immediacy and simplicity characteristic of the beginning just for the reason that it is the result, and has returned upon itself – while this latter again is just the self, and the self is self-referring and self-relating identity and simplicity.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p23) [23.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m023) The need to think of the Absolute as subject, has led men to make use of statements like “God is the eternal”, the “moral order of the world”, or “love”, etc. In such propositions the truth is just barely stated to be Subject, but not set forth as the process of reflectively mediating itself with itself. In a proposition of that kind we begin with the word God. By itself this is a meaningless sound, a mere name; the predicate says afterwards _what_ it is, gives it content and meaning: the empty beginning becomes real knowledge only when we thus get to the end of the statement. So far as that goes, why not speak alone of the eternal, of the moral order of the world, etc., or, like the ancients, of pure conceptions such as being, the one, etc., i.e. of what gives the meaning without adding the meaningless sound at all? But this word just indicates that it is not a being or essence or universal in general that is put forward, but something reflected into self, a subject. Yet at the same time this acceptance of the Absolute as Subject is merely anticipated, not really affirmed. The subject is taken to be a fixed point, and to it as their support the predicates are attached, by a process falling within the individual knowing about it, but not looked upon as belonging to the point of attachment itself; only by such a process, however, could the content be presented as subject. Constituted as it is, this process cannot belong to the subject; but when that point of support is fixed to start with, this process cannot be otherwise constituted, it can only be external. The anticipation that the Absolute is subject is therefore not merely not the realisation of this conception; it even makes realisation impossible. For it makes out the notion to be a static point, while its actual reality is self-movement, self-activity.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p24) [24.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m024) Among the many consequences that follow from what has been said, it is of importance to emphasise this, that knowledge is only real and can only be set forth fully in the form of science, in the form of system; and further, that a so-called fundamental proposition or first principle of philosophy, even if it is true, is yet none the less false just because and in so far as it is merely a fundamental proposition, merely a first principle. It is for that reason easily refuted. The refutation consists in bringing out its defective character, and it _is_ defective because it is merely the universal, merely a principle, the beginning.  If the refutation is complete and thorough, it is derived and developed from the nature of the principle itself, and not accomplished by bringing in from elsewhere other counter assurances and chance fancies. It would be strictly the development of the principle, and thus the completion of its deficiency, were it not that it misunderstands its own purport by taking account solely of the negative aspect of what it seeks to do, and is not conscious of the positive character of its process and result. The really positive working out of the beginning is at the same time just as much the very reverse, it is a negative attitude towards the principle we start from, negative, that is to say, of its one-sided form, which consists in being primarily immediate, a mere purpose. It may therefore be regarded as a refutation of what constitutes the basis of the system; but more correctly it should be looked at as a demonstration that the _basis_ or principle of the system is in point of fact merely its _beginning_.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p25) [25.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m025) That the truth is only realised in the form of system, that substance is essentially subject, is expressed in the idea which represents the Absolute as Spirit (_Geist_) – the grandest conception of all, and one which is due  to modern times and its religion. Spirit is alone Reality. It is the inner being of the world, that which essentially is, and is _per se_; it assumes objective, determinate form, and enters into relations with itself – it is externality (otherness), and exists for self; yet, in this determination, and in its otherness, it is still one with itself – it is self-contained and self-complete, in itself and for itself at once. This self-containedness, however, is first something known by us, it is implicit in its nature (_an sich_); it is Substance spiritual. It has to become self-contained _for itself,_ on its own account; it must be knowledge of spirit, and must be consciousness of itself as spirit. This means, it must be presented to itself as an object, but at the same time straightway annul and transcend this objective form; it must be its own object in which it finds itself reflected. So far as its spiritual content is produced by its own activity, it is only we [the thinkers] who know spirit to be for itself, to be objective to itself; but in so far as spirit knows itself to be for itself, then this self-production, the pure notion, is the sphere and element in which its objectification takes effect, and where it gets its existential form. In this way it is in its existence aware of itself as an object in which its own self is reflected. Mind, which, when thus developed, knows itself to be mind, is science. Science is its realisation, and the kingdom it sets up for itself in its own native element.

#### 7.   The element of knowledge

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p26) [26.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m026) A self having knowledge purely of itself in the absolute antithesis of itself, this pure ether as such, is the very soil where science flourishes, is knowledge in universal form. The beginning of philosophy presupposes or demands from consciousness that it should feel at home in this element. But this element only attains its perfect meaning and acquires transparency through the process of gradually developing it. It is pure spirituality as the universal which assumes the shape of simple immediacy; and this simple element, existing as such, is the field of science, is thinking, which can be only in mind. Because this medium, this immediacy of mind, is the mind’s substantial nature in general, it is the transfigured essence, reflection which itself is simple, which is aware of itself as immediacy; it is being, which is reflection into itself. Science on its side requires the individual self-consciousness to have risen into this high ether, in order to be able to live with science, and in science, and really to feel alive there. Conversely the individual has the right to demand that science shall hold the ladder to help him to get at least as far as this position, shall show him that he has in himself this ground to stand on. His right rests on his absolute independence, which he knows he possesses in every type and phase of knowledge; for in every phase, whether recognised by science or not, and whatever be the content, his right as an individual is the absolute and final form, i.e. he is the immediate certainty of self, and thereby is unconditioned being, were this expression preferred. If the position taken up by consciousness, that of knowing about objective things as opposed to itself, and about itself as opposed to them, is held by science to be the very opposite of what science is: if, when in knowing it keeps within itself and never goes beyond itself, science holds this state to be rather the loss of mind altogether – on the other hand the element in which science consists is looked at by consciousness as a remote and distant region, in which consciousness is no longer in possession of itself. Each of these two sides takes the other to be the perversion of the truth. For the naïve consciousness, to give itself up completely and straight away to science is to make an attempt, induced by some unknown influence, all at once to walk on its head. The compulsion to take up this attitude and move about in this position, is a constraining force it is urged to fall in with, without ever being prepared for it and with no apparent necessity for doing so. Let science be _per se_ what it likes, in its relation to naïve immediate self-conscious life it presents the appearance of being a reversal of the latter; or, again, because naïve self-consciousness finds the principle of its reality in the certainty of itself, science bears the character of unreality, since consciousness “for itself” is a state quite outside of science. Science has for that reason to combine that other element of self-certainty with its own, or rather to show that the other element belongs to itself, and how it does so. When devoid of that sort of reality, science is merely the content of mind _qua_ something implicit or potential (_an sich_); purpose, which at the start is no more than something internal; not spirit, but at first merely spiritual substance. This implicit moment (_Ansich_) has to find external expression, and become objective on its own account. This means nothing else than that this moment has to establish self-consciousness as one with itself.

#### 8. The ascent into this is the Phenomenology of Spirit

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p27) [27.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m027) It is this process by which science in general comes about, this gradual development of knowing, that is set forth here in the _Phenomenology of Mind_. Knowing, as it is found at the start, mind in its immediate and primitive stage, is without the essential nature of mind, is sense-consciousness. To reach the stage of genuine knowledge, or produce the element where science is found – the pure conception of science itself – a long and laborious journey must be undertaken. This process towards science, as regards the content it will bring to light and the forms it will assume in the course of its progress, will not be what is primarily imagined by leading the unscientific consciousness up to the level of science: it will be something different, too, from establishing and laying the foundations of science; and anyway something else than the sort of ecstatic enthusiasm which starts straight off with absolute knowledge, as if shot out of a pistol, and makes short work of other points of view simply by explaining that it is to take no notice of them.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p28) [28.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m028) The task of conducting the individual mind from its unscientific standpoint to that of science had to be taken in its general sense; we had to contemplate the formative development (_Bildung_) of the universal [or general] individual, of self-conscious spirit. As to the relation between these two [the particular and general individual], every moment, as it gains concrete form and its own proper shape and appearance, finds a place in the life of the universal individual. The particular individual is incomplete mind, a concrete shape in whose existence, taken as a whole, one determinate characteristic predominates, while the others are found only in blurred outline. In that mind which stands higher than another the lower concrete form of existence has sunk into an obscure moment; what was formerly an objective fact (_die Sache selbst_) is now only a single trace: its definite shape has been veiled, and become simply a piece of shading. The individual, whose substance is mind at the higher level, passes through these past forms, much in the way that one who takes up a higher science goes through those preparatory forms of knowledge, which he has long made his own, in order to call up their content before him; he brings back the recollection of them without stopping to fix his interest upon them. The particular individual, so far as content is concerned, has also to go through the stages through which the general mind has passed, but as shapes once assumed by mind and now laid aside, as stages of a road which has been worked over and levelled out. Hence it is that, in the case of various kinds of knowledge, we find that what in former days occupied the energies of men of mature mental ability sinks to the level of information, exercises, and even pastimes, for children; and in this educational progress we can see the history of the world’s culture delineated in faint outline. This bygone mode of existence has already become an acquired possession of the general mind, which constitutes the substance of the individual, and, by thus appearing externally to him, furnishes his inorganic nature. In this respect culture or development of mind (_Bildung_), regarded from the side of the individual, consists in his acquiring what lies at his hand ready for him, in making its inorganic nature organic to himself, and taking possession of it for himself. Looked at, however, from the side of universal mind _qua_ general spiritual substance, culture means nothing else than that this substance gives itself its own self-consciousness, brings about its own inherent process and its own reflection into self.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p29) [29.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m029) Science lays before us the morphogenetic process of this cultural development in all its detailed fullness and necessity, and at the same time shows it to be something that has already sunk into the mind as a moment of its being and become a possession of mind. The goal to be reached is the mind’s insight into what knowing is. Impatience asks for the impossible, wants to reach the goal without the means of getting there. The length of the journey has to be borne with, for every moment is necessary; and again we must halt at every stage, for each is itself a complete individual form, and is fully and finally considered only so far as its determinate character is taken and dealt with as a rounded and concrete whole, or only so far as the whole is looked at in the light of the special and peculiar character which this determination gives it. Because the substance of individual mind, nay, more**,** because the universal mind at work in the world (_Weltgeist_), has had the patience to go through these forms in the long stretch of time’s extent, and to take upon itself the prodigious labour of the world’s history, where it bodied forth in each form the entire content of itself, as each is capable of presenting it; and because by nothing less could that all-pervading mind ever manage to become conscious of what itself is – for that reason, the individual mind, in the nature of the case, cannot expect by less toil to grasp what its own substance contains. All the same, its task has meanwhile been made much lighter, because this has historically been implicitly (_an sich_) accomplished, the content is one where reality is already cancelled for spiritual possibilities, where immediacy has been overcome and brought under the control of reflection, the various forms and shapes have been already reduced to their intellectual abbreviations, to determinations of thought (_Gedankenbestimmung_) pure and simple. Being now a thought, the content is the property of the substance of mind; existence has no more to be changed into the form of what is inherent and implicit (_Ansichseins_), but only the implicit – no longer merely something primitive, nor lying hidden within existence, but already present as a recollection – into the form of what is explicit, of what is objective to self (_Fürsichseins_).

#### 9. The transformation of the notion and the familiar into thought –

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p30) [30.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m030) We have to state more exactly the way this is done. At the point at which we here take up this movement, we are spared, in connection with the whole, the process of cancelling and transcending the stage of mere existence. This process has already taken place. What is still to be done and needs a higher kind of transformation, is to transcend the forms as ideally presented and made familiar to our minds. By that previous negative process, existence, having been withdrawn into the mind’s substance, is, in the first instance, transferred to the life of self only in an immediate way. The property the self has thereby acquired, has still the same character of uncomprehended immediacy, of passive indifference, which existence itself had; existence has in this way merely passed into the form of an ideal presentation. At the same time, by so doing, it is something familiar to us, something “well-known”, something which the existent mind has finished and done with, and hence takes no more to do with and no further interest in. While the activity that is done with the existent is itself merely the process of the particular mind, of mind which is not comprehending itself, on the other hand, _knowledge_ is directed against this ideal presentation which has hereby arisen, against this “being-familiar” and “well-known”; it is an action of _universal_ mind, the concern of _thought._

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p31) [31.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m031) What is “familiarly known” is not properly known, just for the reason that it is “familiar”. When engaged in the process of knowing, it is the commonest form of self-deception, and a deception of other people as well, to assume something to be familiar, and give assent to it on that very account. Knowledge of that sort, with all its talk, never gets from the spot, but has no idea that this is the case. Subject and object, and so on, God, nature, understanding, sensibility, etc., are uncritically presupposed as familiar and something valid, and become fixed points from which to start and to which to return. The process of knowing flits between these secure points, and in consequence goes on merely along the surface. Apprehending and proving consist similarly in seeing whether every one finds what is said corresponding to his idea too, whether it is familiar and seems to him so and so or not.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p32) [32.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m032) Analysis of an idea, as it used to be carried out, did in fact consist in nothing else than doing away with its character of familiarity. To break up an idea into its ultimate elements means returning upon its moments, which at least do not have the form of the given idea when found, but are the immediate property of the self. Doubtless this analysis only arrives at thoughts which are themselves familiar elements, fixed inert determinations. But what is thus separated, and in a sense is unreal, is itself an essential moment; for just because the concrete fact is self-divided, and turns into unreality, it is something self-moving, self-active. The action of separating the elements is the exercise of the force of Understanding, the most astonishing and greatest of all powers, or rather the absolute power. The circle, which is self-enclosed and at rest, and, _qua_ substance, holds its own moments, is an immediate relation, the immediate, continuous relation of elements with their unity, and hence arouses no sense of wonderment. But that an accident as such, when out loose from its containing circumference, – that what is bound and held by something else and actual only by being connected with it, – should obtain an existence all its own, gain freedom and independence on its own account – this is the portentous power of the negative; it is the energy of thought, of pure ego. Death, as we may call that unreality, is the most terrible thing, and to keep and hold fast what is dead demands the greatest force of all. Beauty, powerless and helpless, hates understanding, because the latter exacts from it what it cannot perform. But the life of mind is not one that shuns death, and keeps clear of destruction; it endures death and in death maintains its being. It only wins to its truth when it finds itself utterly torn asunder. It is this mighty power, not by being a positive which turns away from the negative, as when we say of anything it is nothing or it is false, and, being then done with it, pass off to something else: on the contrary, mind is this power only by looking the negative in the face, and dwelling with it. This dwelling beside it is the magic power that converts the negative into being. That power is just what we spoke of above as subject, which by giving determinateness a place in its substance, cancels abstract immediacy, i.e. immediacy which merely _is_, and, by so doing, becomes the true substance, becomes being or immediacy that does not have mediation outside it, but is this mediation itself.

#### 10. – and this into the Concept/Notion

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p33) [33.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m033) This process of making what is objectively presented a possession of pure self-consciousness, of raising it to the level of universality in general, is merely one aspect of mental development; spiritual evolution is not yet completed. The manner of study in ancient times is distinct from that of the modern world, in that the former consisted in the cultivation and perfecting of the natural mind. Testing life carefully at all points, philosophizing about everything it came across, the former created an experience permeated through and through by universals. In modern times, however, an individual finds the abstract form ready made. In straining to grasp it and make it his own, he rather strives to bring forward the inner meaning alone, without any process of mediation; the production of the universal is abridged, instead of the universal arising out of the manifold detail of concrete existence. Hence nowadays the task before us consists not so much in getting the individual clear of the stage of sensuous immediacy, and making him a substance that thinks and is grasped in terms of thought, but rather the very opposite: it consists in actualising the universal, and giving it spiritual vitality, by the process of breaking down and superseding fixed and determinate thoughts. But it is much more difficult to make fixed and definite thoughts fuse with one another and form a continuous whole than to bring sensuous existence into this state. The reason lies in what was said before. Thought determinations get their substance and the element of their existence from the ego, the power of the negative, or pure reality; while determinations of sense find this in impotent abstract immediacy, in mere being as such. Thoughts become fluent and interfuse, when thinking pure and simple, this inner immediacy, knows itself as a moment, when pure certainty of self abstracts from itself. It does not “abstract” in the sense of getting away from itself and setting itself on one side, but of surrendering the fixed quality of its self-affirmation, and giving up both the fixity of the purely concrete – which is the ego as contrasted with the variety of its content – and the fixity of all those distinctions [the various thought-functions, principles, etc.] which are present in the element of pure thought and share that absoluteness of the ego. In virtue of this process pure thoughts become notions, concepts, and are then what they are in truth, self-moving functions, circles, are what their substance consists in, are spiritual entities.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p34) [34.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m034) This movement of the spiritual entities constitutes the nature of scientific procedure in general. Looked at as the concatenation of their content, this movement is the necessitated development and expansion of that content into an organic systematic whole. By this movement, too, the road, which leads to the notion of knowledge, becomes itself likewise a necessary and complete evolving process (_Werden_). This preparatory stage thus ceases to consist of casual philosophical reflections, referring to objects here and there, to processes and thoughts of the undeveloped mind as chance may direct; and it does not try to establish the truth by miscellaneous ratiocinations, inferences, and consequences drawn from circumscribed thoughts. The road to science, by the very movement of the notion itself, will compass the entire objective world of conscious life in its rational necessity.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p35) [35.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m035) Further, a systematic exposition like this constitutes the first part of science, because the positive existence of mind, _qua_ primary and ultimate, is nothing but the immediate aspect of mind, the beginning; the beginning, but not yet its return to itself. The characteristic feature distinguishing this part of science [Phenomenology] from the others is the element of positive immediate existence. The mention of this distinction leads us to discuss certain established ideas that usually come to notice in this connection.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p36) [36.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m036) The mind’s immediate existence, conscious life, has two aspects – cognition and objectivity which is opposed to or negative of the subjective function of knowing. Since it is in the medium of consciousness that mind is developed and brings out its various moments, this opposition between the factors of conscious life is found at each stage in the evolution of mind, and all the various moments appear as modes or forms (_Gestalten_) of consciousness. The scientific statement of the course of this development is a science of the experience through which consciousness passes; the substance and its process are considered as the object of consciousness. Consciousness knows and comprehends nothing but what falls within its experience; for what is found in experience is merely spiritual substance, and, moreover, object of its self. Mind, however, becomes object, for it consists in the process of becoming an other to itself, i.e. an object for its own self, and in transcending this otherness. And experience is called this very process by which the element that is immediate, unexperienced, i.e. abstract – whether it be in the form of sense or of a bare thought – externalises itself, and then comes back to itself from this state of estrangement, and by so doing is at length set forth in its concrete nature and real truth, and becomes too a possession of consciousness.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p37) [37.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m037) The dissimilarity which obtains in consciousness between the ego and the substance constituting its object, is their inner distinction, the factor of negativity in general. We may regard it as the defect of both opposites, but it is their very soul, their moving spirit. It was on this account that certain thinkers long ago took the void to be the principle of movement, when they conceived the moving principle to be the negative element, though they had not as yet thought of it as self. While this negative factor appears in the first instance as a dissimilarity, as an inequality, between ego and object, it is just as much the inequality of the substance with itself. What seems to take place outside it, to be an activity directed against it, is its own doing, its own activity; and substance shows that it is in reality subject. When it has brought out this completely, mind has made its existence adequate to and one with its essential nature. Mind is object to itself just as it _is_, and the abstract element of immediacy, of the separation between knowing and the truth, is overcome. Being is entirely mediated; it is a substantial content, that is likewise directly in the possession of the ego, has the character of self, is notion. With the attainment of this the _Phenomenology of Mind_ concludes. What mind prepares for itself in the course of its phenomenology is the element of true knowledge. In this element the moments of mind are now set out in the form of thought pure and simple, which knows its object to be itself. They no longer involve the opposition between being and knowing; they remain within the undivided simplicity of the knowing function; they are the truth in the form of truth, and their diversity is merely diversity of the content of truth. The process by which they are developed into an organically connected whole is Logic or Speculative Philosophy.

#### 11. In what way the Phenomenology of the Spirit is negative or contains what is false

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede.htm#p38) [38.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m038) Now, because the systematic statement of the mind’s experience embraces merely its ways of appearing, it may well seem that the advance from that to the science of ultimate truth in the form of truth is merely negative; and we might readily be content to dispense with the negative process as something altogether false, and might ask to be taken straight to the truth at once: why meddle with what is false at all? The point formerly raised, that we should have begun with science at once, may be answered here by considering the character of negativity in general regarded as something false. The usual ideas on this subject particularly obstruct the approach to the truth. The consideration of this point will give us an opportunity to speak about mathematical knowledge, which non-philosophical knowledge looks upon as the ideal which philosophy ought to try to attain, but has so far striven in vain to reach.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p39) [39.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m039) Truth and falsehood as commonly understood belong to those sharply defined ideas which claim a completely fixed nature of their own, one standing in solid isolation on this side, the other on that, without any community between them. Against that view it must be pointed out, that truth is not like stamped coin that is issued ready from the mint and so can be taken up and used. Nor, again, is there something false, any more than there is something evil. Evil and falsehood are indeed not so bad as the devil, for in the form of the devil they get the length of being particular subjects; _qua_ false and evil they are merely universals, though they have a nature of their own with reference to one another. Falsity (that is what we are dealing with here) would be _otherness,_ the negative aspect of the substance, which [substance], _qua_ content of knowledge, is truth. But the substance is itself essentially the negative element, partly as involving distinction and determination of content, partly as being a process of distinguishing pure and simple, i.e. as being self and knowledge in general. Doubtless we can know in a way that is false. To know something falsely means that knowledge is not adequate to, is not on equal terms with, its substance. Yet this very dissimilarity is the process of distinction in general, the essential moment in knowing. It is, in fact, out of this active distinction that its harmonious unity arises, and this identity, when arrived at, is truth. But it is not truth in a sense which would involve the rejection of the discordance, the diversity, like dross from pure metal; nor, again, does truth remain detached from diversity, like a finished article from the instrument that shapes it. Difference itself continues to be an immediate element within truth as such, in the form of the principle of negation, in the form of the activity of Self. All the same, we cannot for that reason say that falsehood is a moment or forms even a constituent part of truth. That “in every case of falsity there is something true” is an expression in which they are taken to be like oil and water, which do not mix and are merely united externally. Just in the interest of their real meaning, precisely because we want to designate the aspect or moment of complete otherness, the terms true and false must no longer be used where their otherness has been cancelled and superseded. Just as the expressions “unity of subject and object”, of “finite and infinite”, of “being and thought”, etc., are clumsy when subject and object, etc., are taken to mean what they are _outside_ their unity, and are thus in that unity not meant to be what its very expression conveys; in the same way falsehood is not, _qua_ false, any longer a moment of truth.

To questions like, “When was Caesar born?”. “How many feet make a furlong?”, etc., a straight answer ought to be given; just as it is absolutely true that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides of a right-angled triangle. But the nature of a so-called truth of that sort is different from the nature of philosophical truth.

#### 12. Historical and mathematical truth

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p41) [41.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m041) As regards truth in matters of historical fact – to deal briefly with this subject – so far as we consider the purely historical element, it will be readily granted that they have to do with the sphere of particular existence, with a content in its contingent and arbitrary aspects, features that have no necessity. But even bare truths of the kind, say, like those mentioned, are impossible without the activity of self-consciousness. In order to know any one of them, there has to be a good deal of comparison, books must be consulted, or in some way or other inquiry has to be made. Even in a case of direct perception, only when we know it along with the reasons behind it, is it held to be something of real value; although it is merely the naked fact itself that we are, properly speaking, supposed to be concerned about.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p42) [42.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m042) As to mathematical truths, we should be still less inclined to consider anyone a geometer who had got Euclid’s theorems by heart (_auswendig_) without knowing the proofs, without, if we may say so by way of contrast, getting them into his head (_inwendig_). Similarly, if anyone came to know by measuring many right-angled triangles that their sides are related in the way everybody knows, we should regard knowledge so obtained as unsatisfactory. All the same, while proof is essential in the case of mathematical knowledge, it still does not have the significance and nature of being a moment in the result itself; the proof is over when we get the result, and has disappeared. _Qua_ result the theorem is, no doubt, one that is seen to be true. But this eventuality has nothing to do with its content, but only with its relation to the knowing subject. The process of mathematical proof does not belong to the object; it is a function that takes place outside the matter in hand. Thus, the nature of a right-angled triangle does not break itself up into factors in the manner set forth in the mathematical construction which is required to prove the proposition expressing the relation of its parts. The entire process of producing the result is an affair of knowledge which takes its own way of going about it. In philosophical knowledge, too, the way existence, _qua_ existence, comes about (_Werden_) is different from that whereby the essence or inner nature of the fact comes into being. But philosophical knowledge, for one thing, contains both, while mathematical knowledge sets forth merely the way an existence comes about, i.e. the way the nature of the fact gets to be in the sphere of knowledge as such. For another thing, too, philosophical knowledge unites both these particular movements. The inward rising into being, the process of substance, is an unbroken transition into outwardness, into existence or being for another; and conversely, the coming of existence into being is withdrawal into the inner essence. The movement is the twofold process in which the whole comes to be, and is such that each at the same time posits the other, and each on that account has in it both as its two aspects. Together they make the whole, through their resolving each other, and making themselves into moments of the whole.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p43) [43.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m043) In mathematical knowledge the insight required is an external function so far as the subject-matter dealt with is concerned. It follows that the actual fact is thereby altered. The means taken, construction and proof, contain, no doubt, true propositions; but all the same we are bound to say that the content is false. The triangle in the above example is taken to pieces, and its parts made into other figures to which the construction in the triangle gives rise. It is only at the end that we find again reinstated the triangle we are really concerned with; it was lost sight of in the course of the construction, and was present merely in fragments, that belonged to other wholes. Thus we find negativity of content coming in here too, a negativity which would have to be called falsity, just as much as in the case of the movement of the notion where thoughts that are taken to be fixed pass away and disappear.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p44) [44.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m044) The real defect of this kind of knowledge, however, affects its process of knowing as much as its material. As to that process, in the first place we do not see any necessity in the construction. The necessity does not arise from the nature of the theorem: it is imposed; and the injunction to draw just these lines, an infinite number of others being equally possible, is blindly acquiesced in, without our knowing anything further, except that, as we fondly believe, this will serve our purpose in producing the proof. Later on this design then comes out too, and is therefore merely external in character, just because it is only after the proof is found that it comes to be known. In the same way, again, the proof takes a direction that begins anywhere we like, without our knowing as yet what relation this beginning has to the result to be brought out. In its course, it takes up certain specific elements and relations and lets others alone, without its being directly obvious what necessity there is in the matter. An external purpose controls this process.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p45) [45.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m045) The evidence peculiar to this defective way of knowing – an evidence on the strength of which mathematics plumes itself and proudly struts before philosophy – rests solely on the poverty of its purpose and the defectiveness of its material, and is on that account of a kind that philosophy must scorn to have anything to do with. Its purpose or principle is quantity. This is precisely the relationship that is non-essential, alien to the character of the notion. The process of knowledge goes on, therefore, on the surface, does not affect the concrete fact itself, does not touch its inner nature or Notion, and is hence not a conceptual way of comprehending. The material which provides mathematics with these welcome treasures of truth consists of space and numerical units (_das Eins_). Space is that kind of existence wherein the concrete notion inscribes the diversity it contains, as in an empty, lifeless element in which its differences likewise subsist in passive, lifeless form. What is concretely actual is not something spatial, such as is treated of in mathematics. With unrealities like the things mathematics takes account of, neither concrete sensuous perception nor philosophy has anything to do. In an unreal element of that sort we find, then, only unreal truth, fixed lifeless propositions. We can call a halt at any of them; the next begins of itself _de novo_, without the first having led up to the one that follows, and without any necessary connection having in this way arisen from the nature of the subject-matter itself. So, too – and herein consists the formal character of mathematical evidence because of that principle and the element where it applies, knowledge advances along the lines of bare equality, of abstract identity. For what is lifeless, not being self-moved, does not bring about distinction within its essential nature; does not attain to essential opposition or unlikeness; and hence involves no transition of one opposite element into its other, no qualitative, immanent movement, no self-movement, It is quantity, a form of difference that does not touch the essential nature, which alone mathematics deals with. It abstracts from the fact that it is the notion which separates space into its dimensions, and determines the connections between them and in them. It does not consider, for example, the relation of line to surface, and when it compares the diameter of a circle with its circumference, it runs up against their incommensurability, i.e. a relation in terms of the notion, an infinite element, that escapes mathematical determination.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p46) [46.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m046) Immanent or so-called pure mathematics, again, does not oppose time _qua_ time to space, as a second subject-matter for consideration. Applied mathematics, no doubt, treats of time, as also of motion, and other concrete things as well; but it picks up from experience synthetic propositions – i.e. statements of their relations, which are determined by their conceptual nature – and merely applies its formulae to those propositions assumed to start with. That the so-called proofs of propositions like that concerning the equilibrium of the lever, the relation of space and time in gravitation, etc., which applied mathematics frequently gives, should be taken and given as proofs, is itself merely a proof of how great the need is for knowledge to have a process of proof, seeing that, even where proof is not to be had, knowledge yet puts a value on the mere semblance of it, and gets thereby a certain sense of satisfaction. A criticism of those proofs would be as instructive as it would be significant, if the criticism could strip mathematics of this artificial finery, and bring out its limitations, and thence show the necessity for another type of knowledge.

As to time, which, it is to be presumed, would, by way of the counterpart to space, constitute the object-matter of the other division of pure mathematics, this is the notion itself in the form of existence. The principle of quantity, of difference which is not determined by the notion, and the principle of equality, of abstract, lifeless unity, are incapable of dealing with that sheer restlessness of life and its absolute and inherent process of differentiation. It is therefore only in an arrested, paralysed form, only in the form of the quantitative unit, that this essentially negative activity becomes the second object-matter of this way of knowing, which, itself an external operation, degrades what is self-moving to the level of mere matter, in order thus to get an indifferent, external, lifeless content.

#### 13. The nature of philosophical truth and its method

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p47) [47.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m047) Philosophy, on the contrary, does not deal with a determination that is non-essential, but with a determination so far as it is an essential factor. The abstract or unreal is not its element and content, but the real, what is self-establishing, has life within itself, existence in its very notion. It is the process that creates its own moments in its course, and goes through them all; and the whole of this movement constitutes its positive content and its truth. This movement includes, therefore, within it the negative factor as well, the element which would be named falsity if it could be considered one from which we had to abstract. The element that disappears has rather to be looked at as itself essential, not in the sense of being something fixed, that has to be cut off from truth and allowed to lie outside it, heaven knows where; just as similarly the truth is not to be held to stand on the other side as an immovable lifeless positive element. Appearance is the process of arising into being and passing away again, a process that itself does not arise and does not pass away, but is _per se,_ and constitutes reality and the life-movement of truth. The truth is thus the bacchanalian revel, where not a member is sober; and because every member no sooner becomes detached than it _eo ipso_ collapses straightway, the revel is just as much a state of transparent unbroken calm. Judged by that movement, the particular shapes which mind assumes do not indeed subsist any more than do determinate thoughts or ideas; but they are, all the same, as much positive and necessary moments, as negative and transitory. In the entirety of the movement, taken as an unbroken quiescent whole, that which obtains distinctness in the course of its process and secures specific existence, is preserved in the form of a self-recollection, in which existence is self-knowledge, and self-knowledge, again, is immediate existence.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p48) [48.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m048) It might well seem necessary to state at the outset the chief points in connection with the method of this process, the way in which science operates. Its nature, however, is to be found in what has already been said, while the proper systematic exposition of it is the special business of Logic, or rather is Logic itself. For the method is nothing else than the structure of the whole in its pure and essential form. In regard, however, to what has been hitherto currently held on this point, we must be sensible that the system of ideas bearing on the question of philosophical method, belongs also to a stage of mental culture that has now passed away. This may perhaps seem somewhat boastful or revolutionary; and I am far from adopting an attitude of that sort; but it is significant that the scientific régime bequeathed by mathematics – a régime of explanations, divisions, axioms, an array of theorems, with proofs, principles, and the consequences and conclusions drawn from them – all this has already come to be generally considered as at any rate out of date. Even though there is no clear idea why it is unsuitable, yet little or no use is made of it any longer; and even though it is not condemned outright, it is all the same not in favour. And we must be so far prejudiced in favour of what is excellent to believe that it can turn itself to practical account, and make itself acceptable. But it is not difficult to see that the method of propounding a proposition, producing reasons for it and then refuting its opposite by reasons too, is not the form in which truth can appear. Truth moves itself by its very nature; but the method just mentioned is a form of knowledge external to its material. Hence it is peculiar to mathematics and must be left to mathematics, which, as already indicated, takes for its principle the relation of quantity, a relation alien to the notion, and gets its material from lifeless space, and the equally lifeless numerical unit. Or, again, such a method, adopting a freer style, one involving more of arbitrariness and chance, may have a place in ordinary life, in a conversation, or in supplying matter-of-fact instruction for the satisfaction of curiosity rather than knowledge, very much as a preface does. In every-day life the mind finds its content in different kinds of knowledge, experiences of various sorts, concrete facts of sense, thoughts, too, and principles, and, in general, in whatever lies ready to hand, or passes for a solid stable entity, or real being. The mind follows wherever this leads, sometimes interrupting the connection by an unrestrained caprice in dealing with the content, and takes up the attitude of determining and handling it in quite an external fashion. It runs the content back to some touchstone of certainty or other, even though it be but the feeling of the moment; and conviction is satisfied if it reaches some familiar resting-place.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p49) [49.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m049) But when the necessity of the notion banishes from its realm the loose procedure of the “raisonnements” of conversation, as well as the pedantic style of scientific pomposity, its place, as we have already mentioned, must not be taken by the disconnected utterance of presageful surmise and inspiration, and the arbitrary caprice of prophetic utterance; for this does not merely despise that particular form of scientific procedure, but contemns scientific procedure altogether.

#### 14.  Against schematizing formalism

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p50) [50.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m050) Now that the triplicity, adopted in the system of Kant – a method rediscovered, to begin with, by instinctive insight, but left lifeless and uncomprehended – has been raised to its significance as an absolute method, true form is thereby set up in its true content, and the conception of science has come to light. But the use this form has been put to in certain quarters has no right to the name of science. For we see it there reduced to a lifeless schema, to nothing better than a mere shadow, and scientific organization to a synoptic table. This formalism – about which we spoke before in general terms, and whose procedure we wish here to state more fully – thinks it has comprehended and expressed the nature and life of a given form when it proclaims a determination of the schema to be its predicate. The predicate may be subjectivity or objectivity, or again magnetism, electricity, and so on, contraction or expansion, East or West, and such like – a form of predication that can be multiplied indefinitely, because according to this way of working each determination, each mode, can be applied as a form or schematic element in the case of every other, and each will thankfully perform the same service for any other. With a circle of reciprocities of this sort it is impossible to make out what the real fact in question is, or what the one or the other is. We find there sometimes constituents of sense picked up from ordinary intuition, determinate elements which to be sure should mean something else than they say; at other times what is inherently significant, viz. pure determinations of thought – like subject, object, substance, cause, universality, etc. – these are applied just as uncritically and unreflectingly as in every-day life, are used much as people employ the terms strong and weak, expansion and contraction. As a result that type of metaphysics is as unscientific as those ideas of sense.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p51) [51.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m051) Instead of the inner activity and self-movement of its own actual life, such a simple determination of direct intuition (_Anschauung_) – which means here sense-knowledge – is predicated in accordance with a superficial analogy, and this external and empty application of the formula is called “construction”. The same thing happens here, however, as in the case of every kind of formalism. A man’s head must be indeed dull if he could not in a quarter of an hour get up the theory that there are enervating, innervating, and indirectly enervating diseases and as many cures, and who could not – since not so long ago instruction of that sort sufficed for the purpose – in as short a time be turned from being a man who works by rule of thumb into a theoretical physician. Formalism in the case of speculative Philosophy of Nature (_Naturphilosophie_) takes the shape of teaching that understanding is electricity, animals are nitrogen, or equivalent to South or North and so on. When it does this, whether as badly as it is here expressed or even concocted with more terminology, such forceful procedure brings and holds together elements to all appearance far removed from one another; the violence done to stable inert sense-elements by connecting them in this way, confers on them merely the semblance of a conceptual unity, and spares itself the trouble of doing what is after all the important thing – expressing the notion itself, the meaning that underlies sense-ideas. All this sort of thing may strike anyone who has no experience with admiration and wonder. He may be awed by the profound genius he thinks it displays, and be delighted at the happy ingenuity of such characterisations, since they fill the place of the abstract notion with something tangible and sensuous, and so make it more pleasing; and he may congratulate himself on feeling an instinctive mental affinity for that glorious way of proceeding. The trick of wisdom of that sort is as quickly acquired as it is easy to practise. Its repetition, when once it is familiar, becomes as boring as the repetition of any bit of sleight-of-hand once we see through it. The instrument for producing this monotonous formalism is no more difficult to handle than the palette of a painter, on which lie only two colours, say red and green, the former for colouring the surface when we want a historical piece, the latter when we want a bit of landscape. It would be difficult to settle which is greater in all this, the agreeable ease with which everything in heaven and earth and under the earth is plastered with that botch of colour, or the conceit that prides itself on the excellence of its means for every conceivable purpose; the one lends support to the other. What results from the use of this method of sticking on to everything in heaven and earth, to every kind of shape and form, natural and spiritual, the pair of determinations from the general schema, and filing everything in this manner, is no less than an “account as clear as noonday” of the organised whole of the universe. It is, that is to say, a synoptic index, like a skeleton with tickets stuck all over it, or like the rows of boxes kept shut and labelled in a grocer’s stall; and is as intelligible as either the one or the other. It has lost hold of the living nature of concrete fact; just as in the former case we have merely dry bones with flesh and blood all gone, and in the latter, there is shut away in those boxes something equally lifeless too. We have already remarked that the final outcome of this style of thinking is, at the same time, to paint entirely in one kind of colour; for it turns with contempt from the distinctions in the schematic table, looks on them as belonging to the activity of mere reflection, and lets them drop out of sight in the void of the Absolute, and there reinstates pure identity, pure formless whiteness. Such uniformity of colouring in the schema with its lifeless determinations, this absolute identity, and the transition from one to the other – these are the one as well as the other, the expression of inert lifeless understanding, and equally an external process of knowledge.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p52) [52.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m052) Not only can what is excellent not escape the fate of being thus devitalised and despiritualised and excoriated of seeing its skin paraded about by lifeless knowledge and the conceit such knowledge engenders; but rather, such a fate lets us realise the power the “excellent” exercises over the heart (_Gemüth_), if not over the mind (_Geist_). Moreover, we recognise thereby, too, the constructive unfolding into universality and determinateness of form which marks the complete attainment of excellence, and which alone makes it possible that this universality can be turned to superficial uses.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p53) [53.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m053) Science can become an organic system only by the inherent life of the notion. In science the determinateness, which was taken from the schema and stuck on to existing facts in external fashion, is the self directing inner soul of the concrete content. The movement of what is partly consists in becoming another to itself, and thus developing explicitly into its own immanent content; partly, again, it takes this evolved content, this existence it assumes, back into itself, i.e. makes itself into a moment, and reduces itself to simple determinateness. In the first stage of the process negativity lies in the function of distinguishing and establishing existence; in this latter return into self, negativity consists in the bringing about of determinate simplicity. It is in this way that the content shows its specific characteristic not to be received from something else, and stuck on externally; the content gives itself this determinate characteristic, appoints itself of its own initiative to the rank of a moment and to a place in the whole. The pigeon-holing process of understanding retains for itself the necessity and the notion controlling the content, that which constitutes the concrete element, the actuality and living process of the subject-matter which it labels: or rather, understanding does not retain this for itself, on the contrary, understanding fails to know it. For if it had as much insight as that, it would surely show that it had. It is not even aware of the need for such insight; if it were, it would drop its schematizing process, or at least would no longer be satisfied to know by way of a mere table of contents. A table of contents is all that understanding gives, the content itself it does not furnish at all.

If the specific determination (say even one like magnetism) is one that in itself is concrete or actual, it all the same gets degraded into something lifeless and inert, since it is merely predicated of another existing entity, and not known as an immanent living principle of this existence; nor is there any comprehension of how in this entity its intrinsic and peculiar way of expressing and producing itself takes effect. This, the very kernel of the matter, formal understanding leaves to others to add later on. Instead of making its way into the inherent content of the matter in hand, understanding always takes a survey of the whole, assumes a position above the particular existence about which it is speaking, i.e. it does not see it at all.

True scientific knowledge, on the contrary, demands abandonment to the very life of the object, or, which means the same thing, claims to have before it the inner necessity controlling the object, and to express this only. Steeping itself in its object, it forgets to take that general survey, which is merely a turning of knowledge away from the content back into itself. But being sunk into the material in hand, and following the course that such material takes, true knowledge returns back into itself, yet not before the content in its fullness is taken into itself, is reduced to the simplicity of being a determinate characteristic, drops to the level of being one aspect of an existing entity, and passes over into its higher truth. By this process the whole as such, surveying its entire content, itself emerges out of the wealth wherein its process of reflection seemed to be lost.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p54) [54.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m054) In general, in virtue of the principle that, as we expressed it before, substance is implicitly and in itself subject, all content makes its reflection into itself in its own special way. The subsistence or substance of anything that exists is its self-identity; for its want of identity, or oneness with itself, would be its dissolution. But self-identity is pure abstraction; and this is just thinking. When I say Quality, I state simple determinateness; by means of its quality one existence is distinguished from another or is an “existence”; it is for itself, something on its own account, or subsists with itself because of this simple characteristic. But by doing so it is essentially Thought.

Here we find contained the principle that Being is Thought: here is exercised that insight which usually tends to deviate from the ordinary non-conceptual way of speaking of the identity of thought and being. In virtue, further, of the fact that subsistence on the part of what exists is self-identity or pure abstraction, it is the abstraction of itself from itself, in other words, is itself its own want of identity with itself and dissolution – its own proper inwardness and retraction into self – its process of becoming.

Owing to the nature which being thus has, and so far as what is has this nature from the point of view of knowledge, this thinking is not an activity which treats the content as something alien and external; it is not reflection into self away from the content. Science is not that kind of Idealism which stepped into the place of the Dogmatism of mere assertion and took the shape of a Dogmatism of mere assurance, the Dogmatism of mere self-certainty. Rather, since knowledge sees the content go back into its own proper inner nature, the activity of knowledge is absorbed in that content – for it (the activity) is the immanent self of the content – and is also at the same time returned into itself, for this activity is pure self-identity in otherness. In this way the knowing activity is the artful device which, while seeming to refrain from activity, looks on and watches how specific determinateness with its concrete life, just where it believes it is working out its own self-preservation and its own private interest, is, in point of fact, doing the very opposite, is doing what brings about its own dissolution and makes itself a moment in the whole.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p55) [55.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m055) While, in the foregoing, the significance of Understanding was stated from the point of view of the self-consciousness of substance; by what has been here stated we can see clearly its significance from the point of view of substance _qua_ being. Existence is Quality, self-identical determinateness, or determinate simplicity, determinate thought: this is existence from the point of view of Understanding. On this account it is Nous, as Anaxagoras first thought reality to be. Those who succeeded him grasped the nature of existence in a more determinate way as Eidos or _Idea_, i.e. as determinate or specific universality, kind or species. The term species or kind seems indeed too ordinary and inadequate for Ideas, for beauty, holiness, eternal, which are the vogue in these days. As a matter of fact, however, idea means neither more nor less than kind, species. But we often find nowadays that a term which exactly designates a conception is despised and rejected, and another preferred to it which hides and obscures the conception, and thus sounds more edifying, even though this is merely due to its being expressed in a foreign language.

Precisely for the reason that existence is designated a species or kind, it is naked simple thought: Nous, simplicity, is substance. It is on account of its simplicity, its self-identity, that it appears steady, fixed, and permanent. But this self-identity is likewise negativity; hence that fixed and stable existence carries the process of its own dissolution within itself. The determinateness appears at first to be so solely through its relation to something else; and its process seems imposed and forced upon it externally. But its having its own otherness within itself, and the fact of its being a self-initiated process – these are implied in the very simplicity of thought itself. For this is self-moving thought, thought that distinguishes, is inherent inwardness, the pure notion. Thus, then, it is the very nature of understanding to be a process; and being a process it is Rationality.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p56) [56.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m056) In the nature of existence as thus described – to be its own notion and being in one – consists logical necessity in general. This alone is what is rational, the rhythm of the organic whole: it is as much knowledge of content as that content is notion and essential nature. In other words, this alone is the sphere and element of speculative thought. The concrete shape of the content is resolved by its' own inherent process into a simple determinate quality. Thereby it is raised to logical form, and its being and essence coincide; its concrete existence is merely this process that takes place, and is _eo ipso_ logical existence. It is therefore needless to apply a formal scheme to the concrete content in an external fashion; the content is in its very nature a transition into a formal shape, which, however, ceases to be formalism of an external kind, because the form is the indwelling process of the concrete content itself.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p57) [57.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m057) This nature of scientific method, which consists partly in being inseparable from the content, and partly in determining the rhythm of its movement by its own agency, finds, as we mentioned before, its peculiar systematic expression in speculative philosophy. What is here stated describes in effect the essential principle; but cannot stand for more at this stage than an assertion or assurance by way of anticipation. The truth it contains is not to be found in this exposition, which is in part historical in character. And just for that reason, too, it is not in the least refuted if anyone assures us on the contrary that this is not so, that the process instead is here so and so; if ideas we are all used to, being truths accepted or settled and familiar to everyone, are brought to mind and recounted; or, again, if something new is served up and guaranteed as coming from the inner sanctuaries of inspired intuition.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p58) [58.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m058) Such a view is bound to meet with opposition. The first instinctive reaction on the part of knowing, when offered something that was unfamiliar, is usually to resist it. It seeks by that means to save freedom and native insight, to secure its own inherent authority against alien authority – for that is the way anything apprehended for the first time appears. This attitude is adopted, too, in order to do away with the semblance of a kind of disgrace which would lie in the fact that something has had to be learnt. In like manner, again, when the unfamiliar or unknown is received with applause, the reaction is in the same way an exaltation of freedom and native authority. It consists in something analogous to ultra-revolutionary declamation and action.

#### 15. The demands of the study of philosophy

Hence the important thing for the student of science is to make himself undergo the strenuous toil of conceptual reflection, of thinking in the form of the notion. This demands concentrated attention on the notion as such, on simple and ultimate determinations like being-in-itself, being-for-itself, self-identity, and so on; for these are elemental, pure, self-determined functions of a kind we might call souls, were it not that their conceptual nature denotes something higher than that term contains. The interruption by conceptual thought of the habit of always thinking in figurative ideas (_Vorstellungen_) is as annoying and troublesome to this way of thinking as to that process of formal intelligence which in its reasoning rambles about with no real thoughts to reason with. The former, the habit, may be called materialised thinking, a fortuitous mental state, one that is absorbed in what is material, and hence finds it very distasteful at once to lift its self clear of this matter and be with itself alone. The latter, the process of _raisonnement_, is, on the other hand, detachment from all content, and conceited superiority to it. What is wanted here is the effort and struggle to give up this kind of freedom, and instead of being a merely arbitrary principle directing the content anyhow, this freedom should sink into and pervade the content, should let it be directed and controlled by its own proper nature, i.e. by the self as its own self, and should observe this process taking place. We must abstain from interrupting the immanent rhythm of the movement of conceptual thought; we must refrain from arbitrarily interfering with it, and introducing ideas and reflections that have been obtained elsewhere. Restraint of this sort is itself an essential condition of attending to and getting at the real nature of the notion.

#### 16. Argumentative thinking in its negative attitude –

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p59) [59.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m059) There are two aspects in the case of that ratiocinative procedure which mark its contrast from conceptual thinking and call for further notice. _Raisonnement,_ in the first place, adopts a negative attitude towards the content apprehended; knows how to refute it and reduce it to nothingness. To see what the content is _not_ is merely a negative process; it is a dead halt, which does not of itself go beyond itself, and proceed to a new content; it has to get hold of something else from somewhere or other in order to have once more a content. It is reflection upon and into the empty ego, the vanity of its own knowledge. Conceit of this kind brings out not only that this content is vain and empty, but also that to see this is itself fatuity too: for it is negation with no perception of the positive element within it. In that this reflection does not even have its own negativity as its content, it is not inside actual fact at all, but for ever away outside it. On that account it imagines that by asserting mere emptiness it is going much farther than insight that embraces and reveals a wealth of content. On the other hand, in the case of conceptual thinking, as was above indicated, the negative aspect falls within the content itself, and is the positive substance of that content, as well as being its inherent character and moving principle as by being the entirety of what these are. Looked at as a result, it is determinate specific negation, the negative which is the outcome of this process, and consequently is a positive content as well.

#### 17. – in its positive attitude; its subject

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p60) [60.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m060) In view of the fact that ratiocinative thinking has a content, whether of images or thoughts or a mixture of both, there is another side to its process which makes conceptual comprehension difficult for it. The peculiar nature of this aspect is closely connected with the essential meaning of the idea above described, in fact, expresses the idea in the way this appears as the process of thinking apprehension. For just as ratiocinative thinking in its negative reference, which we have been describing, is nothing but the self into which the content returns; in the same way, on the other hand, in its positive cognitive process the self is an ideally presented subject to which the content is related as an accident and predicate. This subject constitutes the basis to which the content is attached and on which the process moves to and fro. Conceptual thinking goes on in quite a different way. Since the concept or notion is the very self of the object, manifesting itself as the development of the object, it is not a quiescent subject, passively supporting accidents: it is a self-determining active concept which takes up its determinations and makes them its own. In the course of this process that inert passive subject really disappears; it enters into the different constituents and pervades the content; instead of remaining in inert antithesis to determinateness of content, it constitutes, in fact, that very specificity, i.e. the content as differentiated along with the process of bringing this about. Thus the solid basis, which ratiocination found in an inert subject, is shaken to its foundations, and the only object is this very movement of the subject. The subject supplying the concrete filling to its own content ceases to be something transcending. this content, and cannot have further predicates or accidents. Conversely, again, the scattered diversity of the content is brought under the control of the self, and so bound together; the content is not a universal that can be detached from the subject, and adapted to several indifferently. Consequently the content is in truth no longer predicate of the subject; it is the very substance, is the inmost reality, and the very principle of what is being considered. Ideational thinking (_vorstellen_), since its nature consists in dealing with accidents or predicates, and in exercising the right to transcend them because they are nothing more than predicates and accidents – this way of thinking is checked in its course, since that which has in the proposition the form of a predicate is itself the substance of the statement. It is met by a counter-thrust, as we may say. Starting from the subject, as if this were a permanent base on which to proceed, it discovers, by the predicate being in reality the substance, that the subject has passed into the predicate, and has thereby ceased to be subject: and since in this way what seems to be predicate has become the entire mass of the content, whole and complete, thinking cannot wander and ramble about at will, but is restrained and controlled by this weight of content.

Usually the subject is first set down as the fixed and objective self; from this fixed position the necessary process passes on to the multiplicity of determinations or predicates. Here the knowing ego takes the place of that subject and is the function of knitting or combining the predicates one with another, and is the subject holding them fast. But since the former subject enters into the determinate constituents themselves, and is their very life, the subject in the second case – viz. the knowing subject – finds that the former, which it is supposed to be done with and which it wants to transcend, in order to return into itself, – is still there in the predicate: and instead of being able to be the determining agency in the process of resolving the predicate – reflectively deciding whether this or that predicate should be attached to the former subject – it has really to deal with the self of the content, is not allowed to be something on its own account (_für sich_), but has to exist along with this content.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p61) [61.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m061) What has been said can be expressed in a formal manner by saying that the nature of judgment or the proposition in general, which involves the distinction of subject and predicate, is subverted and destroyed by the speculative judgment; and the identical proposition, which the former becomes [by uniting subject and predicate], implies the rejection and repudiation of the above relation between subject and predicate. This conflict between the form of a proposition in general and the unity of the notion which destroys that form, is similar to what we find between metre and accent in the case of rhythm. Rhythm is the result of what hovers between and unites both. So in the case of the speculative or philosophical judgment; the identity of subject and predicate is not intended to destroy their distinction, as expressed in propositional form; their unity is to arise as a harmony of the elements. The form of the judgment is the way the specific sense appears, or is made manifest, the accent which differentiates the meaning it contains: that the predicate expresses the substance, and the subject itself falls within the universal, is however the unity wherein that accent dies away.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p62) [62.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m062) To explain what has been said by examples let us take the proposition God is Being. The predicate is “being”: it has substantive significance, and thus absorbs the meaning of the subject within it. Being is meant to be here not predicate but the essential nature. Thereby, God seems to cease to be what he was when the proposition was put forward, viz. a fixed subject. Thinking [i.e. ordinary reflection], instead of getting any farther with the transition from subject to predicate, in reality finds its activity checked through the loss of the subject, and it is thrown back on the thought of the subject because it misses this subject. Or again, since the predicate has itself been pronounced to be a subject, to be the being, to be the essential reality, which exhausts the nature of the subject, thinking finds the subject directly present in the predicate too: and now, instead of having, in the predicate, gone into _itself,_ and preserved the freedom characteristic of ratiocination, it is absorbed in the content all the while, or, at any rate is required to be so.

Similarly when it is said: “the real is the universal”, the real, _qua_ subject, passes away in its predicate. The universal is not only meant to have the significance of a predicate, as if the proposition stated that the real is universal: the universal is meant to express the essential nature of the real. Thinking therefore loses that fixed objective basis which it had in the subject, just as much as in the predicate it is thrown back on the subject, and therein returns not into itself but into the subject underlying the content.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p63) [63.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m063) This unaccustomed restraint imposed upon thought is for the most part the cause of the complaints concerning the unintelligibility of philosophical writings, when otherwise the individual has in him the requisite mental cultivation for understanding them. In what has been said we see the reason for the specific charge often made against them, that a good deal has to be read repeatedly before it can be understood – an accusation which is meant to convey something improper in the extreme, and one which if granted to be sound admits of no further reply. It is obvious from the above what is the state of the case here. The philosophical proposition, being a proposition, calls up the accepted view of the usual relation of subject and predicate, and suggests the idea of the customary procedure which takes place in knowledge. Its philosophical content destroys this way of proceeding and the ordinary view taken of this process. The common view discovers that the statement is intended in another sense than it is thinking of, and this correction of its opinion compels knowledge to recur to the proposition and take it now in some other sense.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p64) [64.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m064) There is a difficulty which might well be avoided. It consists in mixing up the methods of procedure followed by speculation and ratiocination, when what is said of the subject has at one time the significance of its conceptual principle, and at another time the meaning of its predicate or accidental quality. The one mode of thinking invalidates the other; and only that philosophical exposition can manage to become plastic in character which resolutely sets aside and has nothing to do with the ordinary way of relating the parts of a proposition.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p65) [65.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m065) As a matter of fact, non-speculative thinking has its rights too, which are justifiable, but are disregarded in the speculative way of stating a proposition. Abolishing the form of the proposition must not take place only in an immediate manner, through the mere content of the proposition. On the contrary, we must give explicit expression to this cancelling process; it must be not only that internal restraining and confining of thought within its own substance; this turning of the conception back into itself has to be expressly brought out and stated. This process, which constitutes what formerly had to be accomplished by proof, is the internal dialectical movement of the proposition itself. This alone is the concrete speculative element, and only the explicit expression of this is a speculative systematic exposition. _Qua_ proposition, the speculative aspect is merely the internal restriction of thought within its own substance where the return of the essential principle into itself is not yet brought out. Hence we often find philosophical expositions referring us to the inner intuition, and thus dispensing with the systematic statement of the dialectical movement of the proposition, which is what we wanted all the while. The proposition ought to express what the truth is: in its essential nature the truth is subject: being so, it is merely the dialectical movement, this self-producing course of activity, maintaining, its advance by returning back into itself. In the case of knowledge in other spheres this aspect of expressly stating the internal nature of the content is constituted by proof. When dialectic, however, has been separated from proof, the idea of philosophical demonstration as a matter of fact has vanished altogether.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p66) [66.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m066) On this point it may be mentioned that the dialectical process likewise consists of parts or elements which are propositions. The difficulty indicated seems therefore to recur continually, and seems to be a difficulty inherent in the nature of the case. This is like what happens in the ordinary process of proving anything; the grounds it makes use of need themselves to be based on other grounds again, and so on _ad inflnitum_. This manner of furnishing grounds and conditions, however, concerns that type of proof from which the dialectical movement is distinct and hence belongs to the process of external knowledge. As to what this movement is, its element is the bare concept; this furnishes a content which is through and through subject _impliciter_ and _per se._ There is to be found, therefore, no sort of content standing in a relation, as it were, to an underlying subject, and getting its significance by being attached to this as a predicate. The proposition as it appears is a mere empty form.

Apart from the sensuously apprehended or ideally presented (_vorgestellten_) self, it is in the main the mere name _qua_ name which denotes the subject pure and simple, the empty unit without any conceptual character. For this reason it would e.g. be expedient to avoid the name “God”, because this word is not in its primary use a conception as well, but the special name of an underlying subject, its fixed resting-place; while, on the other hand, being or the one, singleness, subject, etc., themselves directly indicate conceptions. Furthermore, if speculative truths are stated about that subject [God], even then their content is devoid of the immanent notion, because that content is merely present in the form of a passive subject, and owing to this the speculative truths easily take on the character of mere edification. From this side, too, the obstacle, arising from the habit of putting the speculative predicate in the form of a proposition, instead of taking it as an inherent essential conception, is capable of being made greater or less by the mere way philosophical truths are put forward. Philosophical exposition, faithfully following its insight into the nature of speculative truth, must retain the dialectical form, and exclude everything which is not grasped conceptually and is conception.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p67) [67.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m067) Just as much as in the procedure of ratiocination, the study of philosophy finds obstruction, too, in the unreasoning conceit that builds itself on well-established truths, which the possessor considers he has no need to return upon and reconsider, but rather takes to be fundamental, and thinks he can by means thereof propound as well as decide and pass sentence. In this regard, it is especially needful to make once again a serious business of philosophy. In all spheres of science, art, skill, and handicraft it is never doubted that, in order to master them, a considerable amount of trouble must be spent in learning and in being trained. As regards philosophy, on the contrary, there seems still an assumption prevalent that, though every one with eyes and fingers is not on that account in a position to make shoes if he only has leather and a last, yet everybody understands how to philosophize straight away, and pass judgment on philosophy, simply because he possesses the criterion for doing so in his natural reason – as if he did not in the same way possess the standard for shoemaking too in his own foot. It seems as if the possession of philosophy lay just in the want of knowledge and study, as if philosophy left off where the latter began. It, is commonly held to be a formal kind of knowledge devoid of all substantial content. There is a general failure to perceive that, in the case of any knowledge, and any science, what is taken for truth, even as regards content, can only deserve the name of “truth” when philosophy has had a hand in its production. Let the other sciences try as much as they like to get along by ratiocination or _raisonnement_ without philosophy, they are unable to keep alive without it, or to have any spiritual significance and truth in them.

#### 18.   Natural philosophizing as healthy common sense and as genius

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p68) [68.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m068) As regards philosophy in its proper and genuine sense, we find put forward without any hesitation, as an entirely sufficient equivalent for the long course of mental discipline – for that profound and fruitful process through which the human spirit attains to knowledge – the direct revelation of the divine and the healthy common sense of mankind, unconcerned with and undisciplined by any other knowledge or by proper philosophical reflection. These are held to be a good substitute for real philosophy, much in the way that chicory is lauded as a substitute for coffee. It is not a very pleasing spectacle to observe uncultivated ignorance and crudity of mind, with neither form nor taste, without the capacity to concentrate its thoughts on an abstract proposition, still less on a connected statement of such propositions, confidently proclaiming itself to be intellectual freedom and toleration, and even the inspiration of genius. This last used once upon a time, as everyone knows, to be all the vogue in the case of poetry, as it is now in philosophy. Instead of poetry, however, the efforts of this form of inspiration, when it had any sense at all, resulted in the production of trivial prose, or, if it went beyond that, it produced raving harangues. In the same way here in the case of philosophy; philosophizing by the light of nature, which thinks itself too good for conceptual thinking, and, because of the want of it, takes itself to have direct intuitive ideas and poetical thoughts, – such philosophizing trades in arbitrary combinations of an imagination merely disorganised through thinking – fictitious creations that are neither fish nor flesh, neither poetry nor philosophy.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p69) [69.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m069) On the other hand again, when instinctive philosophy follows the more secure course prescribed by healthy common sense, it treats us to a rhetorical _mélange_ of commonplace truths. When it is charged with the triviality of what it offers, it assures us, in reply, that the fullness and richness of its meaning lie deep down in its own heart, and that others must feel this too, since with such phrases as the “heart’s natural innocence”, “purity of conscience”, and so on, it supposes it has expressed things that are ultimate and final, to which no one can take exception, and about which nothing further can be required. But the very problem in hand was just that the best must not be left behind hidden away in secret, but be brought out of the depths and set forth in the light of day. It could quite well from the start have spared itself the trouble of bringing forward ultimate and final truths of that sort; they were long since to be found, say, in the Catechism, in popular proverbs, etc. It is an easy matter to grasp such truths in their indefinite and crooked inaccurate form, and in many cases to point out that the mind convinced of them is conscious of the very opposite truths. When it struggles to get itself out of the mental embarrassment thereby produced, it will tumble into further confusion, and possibly burst out with the assertion that in short and in fine the matter is settled, the truth is so and so, and anything else is mere “sophistry” – a password used by plain common sense against cultivated critical reason, like the phrase “visionary dreaming”, by which those ignorant of philosophy sum up its character once for all. Since the man of common sense appeals to his feeling, to an oracle within his breast, he is done with any one who does not agree. He has just to explain that he has no more to say to any one who does not find and feel the same as himself. In other words, he tramples the roots of humanity underfoot. For the nature of humanity is to impel men to agree with one another, and its very existence lies simply in the explicit realisation of a community of conscious life. What is anti-human, the condition of mere animals, consists in keeping within the sphere of feeling pure and simple, and in being able to communicate only by way of feeling-states.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p70) [70.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m070) When a man asks for a royal road to science, no more convenient and comfortable way can be mentioned to him than to put his trust in “healthy common sense”. And for the rest, to keep abreast of the times and advance with philosophy, let him read reviews of philosophical works, and even go the length of reading the prefaces and first paragraphs of the works themselves; for the latter give the general principles on which everything turns, while the reviews along with the historical notice provide over and above the critical judgment and appreciation, which, being a judgment passed on the work, goes farther than the work that is judged. This common way a man can take in his dressing-gown. But spiritual elation in the eternal, the sacred, the infinite, moves along the highway of truth in the robes of the high priests road that, from the first, is itself immediate being in its innermost, the inspiration of profound and original ideas and flashes of elevated thought. All the same, those depths do not yet reveal the well-spring of inner reality; nor, again, are these sky-rockets the empyrean. True thoughts and scientific insight can only be won by the labour of the notion. Conceptions alone can produce universality in the knowing process. This universality is critically developed and completely finished knowledge. It is not the common indefiniteness and inadequacy of ordinary intelligence. Nor, again, is it that extraordinary kind of universality where the powers and potencies of reason are spoiled and ruined by genius through indolence and self-conceit. It is truth which has successfully reached its own inherent native form. It is this universality which is capable of being the property of every self-conscious reason.

#### 19. Conclusion: the author’s relation to the public

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p71) [71.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m071) Since I have taken the self-development of the notion to be the medium wherein science really exists, and since in those respects to which I have drawn attention, as well as in others, current ideas about the nature of truth and the shape it assumes deviate from my view, and indeed are quite opposed to my position, the consideration of this divergence of view does not seem to promise well for a favourable reception of an attempt to expound the system of science in this sense. In the meantime, I may call to mind that while e.g. the supreme merit of Plato’s philosophy has sometimes been held to consist in his myths which are scientifically valueless, there have also been times, spoken of even as times of mere sentimental enthusiasm, when the Aristotelian philosophy has been respected on account of its speculative depth of insight, and when the _Parmenides_ of Plato – perhaps the greatest literary product of ancient dialectic – has been taken to be the positive expression of the divine life, the unveiling and disclosing of its inmost truth. I may reflect, too, that notwithstanding much cloudy obscurity which was the product of ecstasy, this misunderstood ecstasy was in point of fact meant to be nothing else than the activity of the pure notion; furthermore, that what is best in the philosophy of our time takes its value to lie in its scientific character; and that, even though others take a different view, it is only in virtue of its scientific character that recent philosophy really gains validity and acceptance. Thus, then, I may hope too that this attempt to justify the claim of science to be a conceptual process, and systematically to develop and present science in this its own peculiar medium, will manage to make a way for itself by the inherent truth of the result accomplished. We may rest assured that it is the nature of truth to force its way to recognition when the time comes, and that it only appears when its time has come, and hence never appears too soon, and never finds a public that is not ripe to receive it. And, further, we may be sure that the individual thinker requires this result to take place, in order to give him confidence in regard to what is no more as yet than a matter for himself singly and alone, and in order to find his assurance, which in the first instance merely belongs to a particular individual, realised as something universal. In this connection, however, it is very often necessary to distinguish the public from those who take upon themselves to be its representatives and spokesmen. The public takes up an attitude in many respects quite different from the latter, indeed, even opposed to them. Whereas the public good-naturedly and generously will rather take the blame upon itself when a philosophical work is not quite acceptable or intelligible to it, these “representatives”, on the contrary, convinced of their own competence, put all the blame on the authors. The influence of the work on the public is more silent than the action of those “representatives”, who are like the dead burying their dead. While the general level of insight at the present time is in the main more highly cultivated, its curiosity more quickened and alert, and its judgment more swiftly made up and pronounced, so that the feet of those who will carry you out are already at the door: at the same time we have often to distinguish from all this the slower and more gradual effect which rectifies the direction of attention caught and compelled by imposing assurances, corrects, too, contemptuous censure, and after a little provides a contemporary audience for one part, while another after a temporary vogue finds no audience with posterity any longer.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/vorrede2.htm#p72) [72.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finpref.htm#m072) For the rest, at a time when the universal nature of spiritual life has become so very much emphasised and strengthened, and the mere individual aspect has become, as it should be, correspondingly a matter of indifference, when, too, that universal aspect holds, by the entire range of its substance, the full measure of the wealth it has built up, and lays claim to it all, the share in the total work of mind that falls to the activity of any particular individual can only be very small. Because this is so, the individual must all the more forget himself, as in fact the very nature of science implies and requires that he should; and he must, moreover, become and do what he can. But all the less must be demanded of him, just as he can expect the less from himself, and may ask the less for himself.

# Hegel’s Philosophy of Right  
Preface

THE immediate occasion for publishing these outlines is the need of placing in the bands of my hearers a guide to my professional lectures upon the Philosophy of Right. Hitherto I have used as lectures that portion of the [_Encyclopaedia of the Philosophic Sciences_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/osindex.htm) (1817) which deals with this subject. The present work covers the same ground in a more detailed and systematic way.

But now that these outlines are to be printed and given to the general public, there is an opportunity of explaining points which in lecturing would be commented on orally. Thus the notes are enlarged in order to include cognate or conflicting ideas, further consequences of the theory advocated, and the like. These expanded notes will, it is hoped, throw light upon the more abstract substance of the text, and present a more complete view of some of the ideas current in our own time. Moreover, there is also subjoined, as far as was compatible with the purpose of a compendium, a number of notes, ranging over a still greater latitude. A compendium proper, like a science, has its subject-matter accurately laid out. With the exception, possibly, of one or two slight additions, its chief task is to arrange the essential phases of its material. This material is regarded as fixed and known, just as the form is assumed to be governed by well-ascertained rules. A treatise in philosophy is usually not expected to be constructed on such a pattern, perhaps because people suppose that a philosophical product is a Penelope’s web which must be started anew every day.

This treatise differs from the ordinary compendium mainly in its method of procedure. It must be understood at the outset that the philosophic way of advancing from one matter to another, the general speculative method, which is the only kind of scientific proof available in philosophy, is essentially different from every other. Only a clear insight into the necessity for this difference can snatch philosophy out of the ignominious condition into which it has fallen in our day. True, the logical rules, such as those of definition, classification, and inference are now generally recognised to be inadequate for speculative science. Perhaps it is nearer the mark to say that the inadequacy of the rules has been felt rather than recognised, because they have been counted as mere fetters, and thrown aside to make room for free speech from the heart, fancy and random intuition. But when reflection and relations of thought were required, people unconsciously fell back upon the old-fashioned method of inference and formal reasoning. In my [_Science of Logic_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlconten.htm) I have developed the nature of speculative science in detail. Hence in this treatise an explanation of method will be added only here and there. In a work which is concrete, and presents such a diversity of phases, we may safely neglect to display at every turn the logical process, and may take for granted an acquaintance with the scientific procedure. Besides, it may readily be observed that the work as a whole, and also the construction of the parts, rest upon the logical spirit. From this standpoint, especially, is it that I would like this treatise to be understood and judged. In such a work as this we are dealing with a science, and in a science the matter must not be separated from the form.

Some, who are thought to be taking a profound view, are heard to say that everything turns upon the subject-matter, and that the form may be ignored. The business of any writer, and especially of the philosopher, is, as they say, to discover, utter, and diffuse truth and adequate conceptions. In actual practice this business usually consists in warming up and distributing on all sides the same old cabbage. Perhaps the result of this operation may be to fashion and arouse the feelings; though even this small merit may be regarded as superfluous, for “they have Moses and the prophets: let them hear them.” Indeed, we have great cause to be amazed at the pretentious tone of those who take this view. They seem to suppose that up till now the dissemination of truth throughout the world has been feeble. They think that the warmed-up cabbage contains new truths, especially to be laid to heart at the present time. And yet we see that what is on one side announced as true, is driven out and swept away by the same kind of worn-out truth. Out of this hurly-burly of opinions, that which is neither new nor old, but permanent, cannot be rescued and preserved except by science.

Further, as to rights, ethical life, and the state, the truth is as old as that in which it is openly displayed and recognised, namely, the law, morality, and religion. But as the thinking spirit is not satisfied with possessing the truth in this simple way, it must conceive it, and thus acquire a rational form for a content which is already rational implicitly. In this way the substance is justified before the bar of free thought. Free thought cannot be satisfied with what is given to it, whether by the external positive authority of the state or human agreement, or by the authority of internal feelings, the heart, and the witness of the spirit, which coincides unquestioningly with the heart. It is the nature of free thought rather to proceed out of its own self, and hence to demand that it should know itself as thoroughly one with truth.

The ingenuous mind adheres with simple conviction to the truth which is publicly acknowledged. On this foundation it builds its conduct and way of life. In opposition to this naive view of things rises the supposed difficulty of detecting amidst the endless differences of opinion anything of universal application. This trouble may easily be supposed to spring from a spirit of earnest inquiry. But in point of fact those who pride themselves upon the existence of this obstacle are in the plight of him who cannot see the woods for the trees. The confusion is all of their own making. Nay, more: this confusion is an indication. that they are in fact not seeking for what is universally valid in right and the ethical order. If they were at pains to find that out, and refused to busy themselves with empty opinion and minute detail, they would adhere to and act in accordance with substantive right, namely the commands of the state and the claims of society. But a further difficulty lies in the fact that man thinks, and seeks freedom and a basis for conduct in thought. Divine as his right to act in this way is, it becomes a wrong, when it takes the place of thinking. Thought then regards itself as free only when it is conscious of being at variance with what is generally recognised, and of setting itself up as something original.

The idea that freedom of thought and mind is indicated only by deviation from, or even hostility to what is everywhere recognised, is most persistent with regard to the state. The essential task of a philosophy of the state would thus seem to be the discovery and publication of a new and original theory.

When we examine this idea and the way it is applied, we are almost led to think that no state or constitution has ever existed, or now exists. We are tempted to suppose that we must now begin and keep on beginning afresh for ever. We are to fancy that the founding of the social order has depended upon present devices and discoveries. As to nature, philosophy, it is admitted, has to understand it as it is. The philosophers’ stone must be concealed somewhere, we say, in nature itself, as nature is in itself rational. Knowledge must, therefore, examine, apprehend and conceive the reason actually present in nature. Not with the superficial shapes and accidents of nature, but with its eternal harmony, that is to say, its inherent law and essence, knowledge has to cope. But the ethical world or the state, which is in fact reason potently and permanently actualised in self-consciousness, is not permitted to enjoy the happiness of being reason at all.

Footnote: There are two kinds of laws, laws of nature and laws of right. The laws of nature are simply there, and are valid as they are. They cannot be gainsaid, although in certain cases they may be transgressed. In order to know laws of nature, we must get to work to ascertain them, for they are true, and only our ideas of them can be false. Of these laws the measure is outside of us. Our knowledge adds nothing to them, and does not further their operation. Only our knowledge of them expands. The knowledge of right is partly of the same nature and partly different. The laws of right also are simply there, and we have to become acquainted with them. In this way the citizen has a more or less firm hold of them as they are given to him, and the jurist also abides by the same standpoint. But there is also a distinction. In connection with the laws of right the spirit of investigation is stirred up, and our attention is turned to the fact that the laws, because they are different, are not absolute. Laws of right are established and handed down by men. The inner voice must necessarily collide or agree with them. Man cannot be limited to what is presented to him, but maintains that he has the standard of right within himself. He may be subject to the necessity and force of external authority, but not in the same way as he is to the necessity of nature; for always his inner being says to him how a thing ought to be, and within himself he finds the confirmation or lack of confirmation of what is generally accepted. In nature the highest truth is that a law is. In right a thing is not valid because it is, since every one demands that it shall conform to his standard. Hence arises a possible conflict between what is and what ought to be, between absolute unchanging right and the arbitrary decision of what ought to be right. Such division and strife occur only on the soil of the spirit. Thus the unique privilege of the spirit would appear to lead to discontent and unhappiness, and frequently we are directed to nature in contrast with the fluctuations of life. But it is exactly in the opposition arising between absolute right, and that which the arbitrary will seeks to make right, that the need lies of knowing thoroughly what right is. Men must openly meet and face their reason, and consider the rationality of right. This is the subject-matter of our science in contrast with jurisprudence, which often has to do merely with contradictions. Moreover the world of today has an imperative need to make this investigation. In ancient times, respect and reverence for the law were universal. But now the fashion of the time has taken another turn, and thought confronts everything which has been approved. Theories now set themselves in opposition to reality, and make as though they were absolutely true and necessary. And there is now more pressing need to know and conceive the thoughts upon right. Since thought has exalted itself as the essential form, we must now be careful to apprehend right also as thought. It would look as though the door were thrown open for every casual opinion, when thought is thus made to supervene upon right. But true thought of a thing is not an opinion, but the conception of the thing itself. The conception of the thing does not come to us by nature. Every man has fingers, and may have brush and colours, but he is not by reason of that a painter. So is it with thought. The thought of right is not a thing which every man has at first hand. True thinking is thorough acquaintance with the object. Hence our knowledge must be scientific.

On the contrary, the spiritual universe is looked upon as abandoned by God, and given over as a prey to accident and chance. As in this way the divine is eliminated from the ethical world, truth must be sought outside of it. And since at the same time reason should and does belong to the ethical world, truth, being divorced from reason, is reduced to a mere speculation. Thus seems to arise the necessity and duty of every thinker to pursue a career of his own. Not that he needs to seek for the philosophers’ stone, since the philosophising of our day has saved him the trouble, and every would-be thinker is convinced that he possesses the stone already without search. But these erratic pretensions are, as it indeed happens, ridiculed by all who, whether they are aware of it or not, are conditioned in their lives by the state, and find their minds and wills satisfied in it. These, who include the majority if not all, regard the occupation of philosophers as a game, sometimes playful, sometimes earnest, sometimes entertaining, sometimes dangerous, but always as a mere game. Both this restless and frivolous reflection and also this treatment accorded to it might safely be left to take their own course, were it not that betwixt them philosophy is brought into discredit and contempt. The most cruel despite is done when every one is convinced of his ability to pass judgment upon, and discard philosophy without any special study. No such scorn is heaped upon any other art or science.

In point of fact the pretentious utterances of recent philosophy regarding the state have been enough to justify anyone who cared to meddle with the question, in the conviction that he could prove himself a philosopher by weaving a philosophy out of his own brain. Notwithstanding this conviction, that which passes for philosophy has openly announced that truth cannot be known. The truth with regard to ethical ideals, the state, the government and the constitution ascends, so it declares, out of each man’s heart, feeling and enthusiasm. Such declarations have been poured especially into the eager ears of the young. The words “God giveth truth to his chosen in sleep” have been applied to science ; hence every sleeper has numbered himself amongst the chosen. But what he deals with in sleep is only the wares of sleep. Mr. Fries, one of the leaders of this shallow-minded host of philosophers, on a public festive occasion, now become celebrated, has not hesitated to give utterance to the following notion of the state and constitution: “When a nation is ruled by a common spirit, then from below, out of the people, will come life sufficient for the discharge of all public business. Living associations, united indissolubly by the holy bond of friendship, will devote themselves to every side of national service, and every means for educating the people.” This is the last degree of shallowness, because in it science is looked upon as developing, not out of thought or conception, but out of direct perception and random fancy. Now the organic connection of the manifold branches of the social system is the architectonic of the state’s rationality, and in this supreme science of state architecture the strength of the whole, is made to depend upon the harmony of all the clearly marked phases of public life, and the stability of every pillar, arch, and buttress of the social edifice. And yet the shallow doctrine, of which we have spoken permits this elaborate structure to melt and lose itself in the brew and stew of the “heart, friendship, and inspiration.” Epicurus, it is said, believed that the world generally should be given over to each individual’s opinions and whims and according to the view we are criticising, the ethical fabric should be treated in the same way. By this old wives’ decoction, which consists in founding upon the feelings what has been for many centuries the labour of reason and understanding, we no longer need the guidance of any ruling conception of thought. On this point Goethe’s _Mephistopheles_, and the poet is a good authority, has a remark, which I have already used elsewhere:

“Verachte nur Verstand und Wissenschaft,  
des Menschen allerhöchste Gaben -  
So hast dem Teufel dich ergeben  
und musst zu Grunde gehn.”

It is no surprise that the view just criticised should appear in the form of piety. Where, indeed, has this whirlwind of impulse not sought to justify itself? In godliness and the Bible it has imagined itself able to find authority for despising order and law. And, in fact, it is piety of the sort which has reduced the whole organised system of truth to elementary intuition and feeling. But piety of the right kind leaves this obscure region, and comes out into the daylight, where the idea unfolds and reveals itself. Out of its sanctuary it brings a reverence for the law and truth which are absolute and exalted above all subjective feeling.

The particular kind of evil consciousness developed by the wishy-washy eloquence already alluded to, may be detected in the following way. It is most unspiritual, when it speaks most of the spirit. It is the most dead and leathern, when it talks of the scope of life. When it is exhibiting the greatest self-seeking and vanity it has most on its tongue the words “people” and “nation.” But its peculiar mark, found on its very forehead, is its hatred of law.

Right and ethical principle, the actual world of right and ethical life are apprehended in thought, and by thought are given definite, general, and rational form, and this reasoned right finds expression in law. But feeling, which seeks its own pleasure, and conscience, which finds right in private conviction, regard the law as their most bitter foe. The right, which takes the shape of law and duty, is by feeling looked upon as a shackle or dead cold letter. In this law it does not recognise itself and does not find itself free. Yet the law is the reason of the object, and refuses to feeling the privilege of warming itself at its private hearth. Hence the law, as we shall occasionally observe, is the Shibboleth, by means of which are detected the false brethren and friends of the so-called people.

Inasmuch as the purest charlatanism has won the name of philosophy, and has succeeded in convincing the public that its practices are philosophy, it has now become almost a disgrace to speak in a philosophic way about the state. Nor can it be taken ill, if honest men become impatient, when the subject is broached. Still less is it a surprise that the government has at last turned its attention to this false philosophising.

With us philosophy is not practised as a private art, as it was by the Greeks, but has a public place, and should therefore be employed only in the service of the state. The government has, up till now, shown such confidence in the scholars in this department as to leave the subject matter of philosophy wholly in their hands. Here and there, perhaps, has been shown to this science not confidence - so much as indifference, and professorships have been retained as a matter of tradition. In France, as far as I am aware, the professional teaching of metaphysics at least has fallen into desuetude. In any case the confidence of the state has been ill requited by the teachers of this subject. Or, if we prefer to see in the state not confidence, but indifference, the decay of fundamental knowledge must be looked upon as a severe penance. Indeed, shallowness is to all appearance most endurable and most in harmony with the maintenance of order and peace, when it does not touch or hint at any real issue.

Hence it would not be necessary to bring it under public control, if the state did not require deeper teaching and insight, and expect science to satisfy the need. Yet this shallowness, notwithstanding its seeming innocence, does bear upon social life, right and duty generally, advancing principles which are the very essence of superficiality. These, as we have learned so decidedly from Plato, are the principles of the Sophists, according to which the basis of right is subjective aims and opinions, subjective feeling and private conviction. The result of such principles is quite as much the destruction of the ethical system, of the upright conscience, of love and right, in private persons, as of public order and the institutions of the state. The significance of these facts for the authorities will not be obscured by the claim that the bolder of these perilous doctrines should be trusted, or by the immunity of office.

The authorities will not be deterred by the demand that they should protect and give free play to a theory which strikes at the substantial basis of conduct, namely, universal principles, and that they should disregard insolence on the ground of its being the exercise of the teacher’s function. _To him, to whom God gives office, He gives also understanding_ is a well-worn jest, which no one in our time would like to take seriously.

In the methods of teaching philosophy, which have under the circumstances been reanimated by the government, the important element of protection and support cannot be ignored. The study of philosophy is in many ways in need of such assistance. Frequently in scientific, religious, and other works may be read a contempt for philosophy. Some, who have no conspicuous education and are total strangers to philosophy, treat it as a cast-off garment. They even rail against it, and regard as foolishness and sinful presumption its efforts to conceive of God and physical and spiritual nature. They scout its endeavour to know the truth. Reason, and again reason, and reason in endless iteration is by them accused, despised, condemned. Free expression, also, is given by a large number of those, who are supposed to be cultivating scientific research, to their annoyance at the unassailable claims of the conception. When we, I say, are confronted with such phenomena as these, we are tempted to harbour the thought that old traditions of tolerance have fallen out of use, and no longer assure to philosophy a, place and public recognition.

Footnote: The same finds expression in a letter of Joh. v. Müller (_Works,_ Part VIII., p. 56), who, speaking of the condition of Rome in the year 1803, when the city was under French rule, writes, “A professor, asked how the public academies were doing, answered, ‘On les tolère comme les bordels!’” Similarly the so-called theory of reason or logic we may still hear commended, perhaps under the belief that it is too dry and unfruitful a science to claim any one’s attention, or, if it be pursued here and there, that its formulae are without content, and, though not of much good, can be of no great harm. Hence the recommendation, so it is thought, if useless, can do no injury.

These presumptuous utterances, which are in vogue in our time, are, strange to say, in a measure justified by the shallowness of the current philosophy. Yet, on the other hand, they have sprung from the same root as that against which they so thanklessly direct their attacks. Since that self-named philosophising has declared that to know the truth is vain, it has reduced all matter of thought to the same level, resembling in this way the despotism of the Roman Empire, which equalised noble and slave, virtue and vice, honour and dishonour, knowledge and ignorance. In such a view the conceptions of truth and the laws of ethical life are simply opinions and subjective convictions, and the most criminal principles, provided only that they are convictions, are put on a level with these laws. Thus, too, any paltry special object, be it never so flimsy, is given the same value as au interest common to all thinking men and the bonds of the established social world.

Hence it is for science a piece of good fortune that that kind of philosophising, which might, like scholasticism, have continued to spin its notions within itself, has been brought into contact with reality. Indeed, such contact was, as we have said, inevitable. The real world is in earnest with the principles of right and duty, and in the full light of a consciousness of these principles it lives. With this world of reality philosophic cob-web spinning has come into open rupture. Now, as to genuine philosophy it is precisely its attitude to reality which has been misapprehended. Philosophy is, as I have already observed, an inquisition into the rational, and therefore the apprehension of the real and present. Hence it cannot be the exposition of a world beyond, which is merely a castle in the air, having no existence except in the error of a one-sided and empty formalism of thought. In the following treatise I have remarked that even Plato’s _Republic_, now regarded as the bye-word for an empty ideal, has grasped the essential nature of the ethical life of the Greeks. He knew that there was breaking in upon Greek life a deeper principle, which could directly manifest itself only as an unsatisfied longing and therefore as ruin. Moved by the same longing Plato had to seek help against it, but had to conceive of the help as coming down from above, and hoped at last to have found it in an external special form of Greek ethical life. He exhausted himself in contriving, how by means of this new society to stem the tide of ruin, but succeeded only in injuring more fatally its deeper motive, the free infinite personality. Yet he has proved himself to be a great mind because the very principle and central distinguishing feature of his idea is the pivot upon which the world-wide revolution then in process turned:

[What is rational is real](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL6);  
And [what is real is rational](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#002).

Upon this conviction stand not philosophy only but even every unsophisticated consciousness. From it also proceeds the view now under contemplation that the spiritual universe is the natural. When reflection, feeling or whatever other form the subjective consciousness may assume, regards the present as vanity, and thinks itself to be beyond it and wiser, it finds itself in emptiness, and, as it has actuality only in the present, it is vanity throughout. Against the doctrine that the idea is a mere idea, figment or opinion, philosophy preserves the more profound view that nothing is real except the idea. Hence arises the effort to recognise in the temporal and transient the substance, which is immanent, and the eternal, which is present. The rational is synonymous with the idea, because in realising itself it passes into external existence. It thus appears in an endless wealth of forms, figures and phenomena. It wraps its kernel round with a robe of many colours, in which consciousness finds itself at home.

Through this varied husk the conception first of all penetrates, in order to touch the pulse, and then feel it throbbing in its external manifestations. To bring to order the endlessly varied relations, which constitute the outer appearance of the rational essence is not the task of philosophy. Such material is not suitable for it, and it can well abstain from giving good advice about these things. Plato could refrain from recommending to the nurses not to stand still with children, but always to dandle them in their arms. So could Fichte forbear to construe, as they say, the supervision of passports to such a point as to demand of all suspects that not only a description of them but also their photograph, should be inserted in the pass. Philosophy now exhibits no trace of such details. These superfine concerns it may neglect all the more safely, since it shows itself of the most liberal spirit in its attitude towards the endless mass of objects and circumstances. By such a course science will escape the hate which is visited upon a multitude of circumstances and institutions by the vanity of a better knowledge. In this hate bitterness of mind finds the greatest pleasure, as it can in no other way attain to a feeling of self-esteem.

This treatise, in so far as it contains a political science, is nothing more than an attempt to conceive of and present the state as in itself rational. As a philosophic writing, it must be on its guard against constructing a state as it _ought to be_. Philosophy cannot teach the state what it _should_ be, but only how it, the ethical universe, is to be _known_.

Idou Podos, idou kai to pidima  
Hic Rhodus, hic saltus. [[NB]](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/h/i.htm#hic-rhodus)

To apprehend what _is_ is the task of philosophy, because what _is_ is reason. As for the individual, every one is a son of his time; so philosophy also is its time apprehended in thoughts. It is just as foolish to fancy that any philosophy can transcend its present world, as that an individual could leap out of his time or jump over Rhodes. If a theory transgresses its time, and builds up a world as it ought to be, it has an existence merely in the unstable element of opinion, which gives room to every wandering fancy.

With little change the above, saying would read:

_Here_ is the rose, _here_ dance

The barrier which stands between reason, as self-conscious Spirit, and reason as present reality, and does not permit spirit to find satisfaction in reality, is some abstraction, which is not free to be conceived. To recognise reason as the rose in the cross of the present, and to find delight in it, is a rational insight which implies reconciliation with reality. This reconciliation philosophy grants to those who have felt the inward demand to conceive clearly, to preserve subjective freedom while present in substantive reality, and yet thought possessing this freedom to stand not upon the particular and contingent, but upon what is and self-completed.

This also is the more concrete meaning of what was a moment ago more abstractly called the unity of form and content. Form in its most concrete significance is reason, as an intellectual apprehension which conceives its object. Content, again, is reason as the substantive essence of social order and nature. The conscious identity of form and content is the philosophical idea.

It is a self-assertion, which does honour to man, to recognise nothing in sentiment which is not justified by thought. This self-will is a feature of modern times, being indeed the peculiar principle of Protestantism. What was initiated by Luther as faith in feeling and the witness of the spirit, the more mature mind strives to apprehend in conception. In that way it seeks to free itself in the present, and so find there itself. It is a celebrated saying that a half philosophy leads away from God, while a true philosophy leads to God. (It is the same halfness, I may say in passing which regards knowledge as an approximation to truth.) This saying is applicable to the science of the state. Reason cannot content itself with a mere approximation, something which is neither cold not hot, and must be spewed out of the mouth. As little can it be contented with the cold scepticism that in this world of time things go badly, or at best only moderately well, and that we must keep the peace with reality, merely because there is nothing better to be had. Knowledge creates a much more vital peace.

Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought to be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late. Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva, takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.

But it is time to close this preface. As a preface it is its place to speak only externally and subjectively of the standpoint of the work which it introduces. A philosophical account of the essential content needs a scientific and objective treatment. So, too, criticisms, other than those which proceed from such a treatment, must be viewed by the author as unreflective convictions. Such subjective criticisms must be for him a matter of indifference.

Hegel’s Philosophy of Right

# Introduction [![hegel](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/images/gwfh.gif)](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sp/osintrod.htm#OS483)

§ 1

THE philosophic science of right has as its object the idea of right, i.e., the conception of right and the realisation of the conception.

Remark: Philosophy has to do with ideas or realised thoughts, and hence not with what we have been accustomed to call mere conceptions. It has indeed to exhibit the one-sidedness and untruth of these mere conceptions, and to show that, while that which commonly bears the name “conception,” is only an abstract product of the understanding, the true conception alone has reality and gives this reality to itself. Everything, other than the reality which is established by the conception, is transient surface existence, external attribute, opinion, appearance void of essence, untruth, delusion, and so forth. Through the actual shape [_Gestaltung_], which it takes upon itself in actuality, is the conception itself understood. This shape is the other essential element of the idea, and is to be distinguished from the form [_Form_], which exists only as conception [_Begriff_].

Addition: The conception and its existence are two sides, distinct yet united, like soul and body. The body is the same life as the soul, and yet the two can be named independently. A soul without a body would not be a living thing, and _vice versa._ Thus the visible existence of the conception is its body, just as the body obeys the soul which produced it. Seeds contain the tree and its whole power, though they are not the tree itself ; the tree corresponds accurately to the simple structure of the seed. If the body does not correspond to the soul, it is defective. The unity of visible existence and conception, of body and soul, is the idea. It is not a mere harmony of the two, but their complete interpenetration. There lives nothing, which is not in some way idea. The idea of right is freedom, which, if it is to be apprehended truly, must be known both in its conception and in the embodiment of the conception.

§ 2.

The science of right is a _part of philosophy_. Hence it must develop the idea, which is the reason of an object, out of the conception. It is the same thing to say that it must regard the peculiar internal development of the thing itself. Since it is a part, it has a definite beginning, which is the result and truth of what goes before, and this, that goes before, constitutes its so-called proof. Hence the origin of the conception of right falls outside of the science of right. The deduction of the conception is presupposed in this treatise, and is to be considered as already given.

Addition: Philosophy forms a circle. It has, since it must somehow make a beginning, a primary, directly given matter, which is not proved and is not a result. But this starting-point is simply relative, since, from another point of view it appears as a result. Philosophy is a consequence, which does not hang in the air or form a directly new beginning, but is self-enclosed.

According to the formal unphilosophic method of the sciences, definition is the first desideratum, as regards, at least, the external scientific form. The positive science of right, however, is little concerned with definition, since its special aim is to give what it is that is right, and also the particular phases of the laws. For this reason it has been said as a warning, _Omnis definitio in jure civili periculosa_ [Any definition in civil law is dangerous]; and in fact the more disconnected and contradictory the phases of a right are, the less possible is a definition of it.

A definition should contain only universal features; but these forthwith bring to light contradictions, which in the case of law are injustice, in all their nakedness. Thus in Roman law, for instance, no definition of man was possible, because it excluded the slave. The conception of man was destroyed by the fact of slavery. In the same way to have defined property and owner would have appeared to be perilous to many relations. But definitions may perhaps be derived from etymology, for the reason, principally, that in this way special cases are avoided, and a basis is found in the feeling and imaginative thought of men.

The correctness of a definition would thus consist in its agreement with existing ideas. By such a method everything essentially scientific is cast aside. As regards the content there is cast aside the necessity of the self-contained and self-developed object, and as regards the form there is discarded the nature of the conception. In philosophic knowledge the necessity of a conception is the main thing, and the process, by which it, as a result, has come into being is the proof and deduction. After the content is seen to be necessary independently, the second point is to look about for that which corresponds to it in existing ideas and modes of speech. But the way in which a conception exists in its truth, and the way it presents itself in random ideas not only are but must be different both in form and structure. If a notion is not in its content false, the conception can be shown to be contained in it and to be already there in its essential traits.

A notion [_Vorstellung_] may thus be raised to the form of a conception [_Begriff_]. But so little is any notion the measure and criterion of an independently necessary and true conception, that it must accept truth from the conception, be justified by it, and know itself through it. If the method of knowing, which proceeds by formal definition, inference and proof, has more or less disappeared, a worse one has come to take its place. This new method maintains that ideas, as, e.g., the idea of right in all its aspects, are to be directly apprehended as mere facts of consciousness, and that natural feeling or that heightened form of it which is known as the inspiration of one’s own breast, is the source of right. This method may be the most convenient of all, but it is also the most unphilosophic. Other features of this view, referring not merely to knowledge but directly to action, need not detain us here. While the first or formal method went so far as to require in definition the form of the conception, and in proof the form of a necessity of knowledge, the method of the intuitive consciousness and feeling takes for its principle the arbitrary contingent consciousness of the subject. In this treatise we take for granted the scientific procedure of philosophy, which has been set forth in the philosophic logic.

§ 3

Right is positive in general (a) in its form, since it has validity in a state; and this established authority is the principle for the knowledge of right. Hence we have the positive science of right. (b) On the side of content this right receives a positive element **[a]** through the particular character of a nation, the stage of its historical development, and the interconnection of all the relations which are necessitated by nature: **[b]** through the necessity that a system of legalised right must contain the application of the universal conception to objects and cases whose qualities are given externally. Such an application is not the speculative thought or the development of the conception, but a subsumption made by the understanding: **[c]** through the ultimate nature of a decision which has become a reality.

Remark: Philosophy at least cannot recognise the authority of feeling, inclination and caprice, when they are set in opposition to positive right and the laws. It is an accident, external to the nature of positive right, when force or tyranny becomes an element of it. It will be shown later (**[§§ 211 - 214](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm#PR211)**), at what point right must become positive. The general phases which are there deduced, are here only mentioned, in order to indicate the limit of philosophic right, and also to forestall the idea or indeed the demand that by a systematic development of right should be produced a law-book, such as would be needed by in actual state. To convert the differences between right of nature and positive right, or those between philosophic right and positive right, into open antagonism would be a complete misunderstanding.

Natural right or philosophic right stands to positive right as institutions to pandects. With regard to the historical element in positive right, referred to in the paragraph, it may be said that the true historical view and genuine philosophic standpoint have been presented by Montesquieu. He regards legislation and its specific traits not in an isolated and abstract way, but rather as a dependent element of one totality, connecting it with all the other elements which form the character of a nation and an epoch. In this interrelation the various elements receive their meaning and justification. The purely historical treatment of the phases of right, as they develop in time, and a comparison of their results with existing relations of right have their own value; but they are out of place in a philosophic treatise, except in so far as the development out of historic grounds coincides with the development out of the conception, and the historical exposition and justification can be made to cover a justification which is valid in itself and independently.

This distinction is as manifest as it is weighty. A phase of right may be shown to rest upon and follow from the circumstances and existing institutions of right, and yet may be absolutely unreasonable and void of right. This is the case in Roman law with many aspects of private right, which were the logical results of its interpretation of paternal power and of marriage. Further, if the aspects of right are really right and reasonable, it is one thing to point out what with regard to them can truly take place through the conception, and quite another thing to portray the manner of their appearance in history, along with the circumstances, cases, wants and events, which they have called forth. Such a demonstration and deduction from nearer or more remote historic causes, which is the occupation of pragmatic history, is frequently called exposition, or preferably conception, under the opinion that in such an indication of the historic elements is found all that is essential to a conception of law and institutions of right. In point of fact that which is truly essential, the conception of the matter, has not been so much as mentioned. So also we are accustomed to hear of Roman or German conceptions of right, and of conceptions of right as they are laid down in this or that statute-book, when indeed nothing about conceptions can be found in them, but only general phases of right, propositions derived from the understanding, general maxims, and laws.

By neglect of the distinction, just alluded to, the true standpoint is obscured and the question of a valid justification is shifted into a justification based upon circumstances; results are founded on presuppositions, which in themselves are of little value; and in general the relative is put in place of the absolute, and external appearance in place of the nature of the thing. When the historical vindication substitutes the external origin for the origin from the conception, it unconsciously does the opposite of what it intends. Suppose that an institution, originating under definite circumstances, is shown to be necessary and to answer its purpose, and that it accomplishes all that is required of it by the historical standpoint. When such a proof is made to stand for a justification of the thing itself, it follows that, when the circumstances are removed, the institution has lost its meaning and its right. When, e.g., it is sought to support and defend cloisters on the grounds that they have served to clear and people the wilderness and by teaching and transcribing to preserve scholarship, it follows that just in so far as the circumstances are changed, cloisters have become aimless and superfluous.

In so far as the historic significance, or the historical exposition and interpretation of the origin of anything is in different spheres at home with the philosophic view of the origin and conception of the thing one might tolerate the other. But, in illustration of the fact that they neither here nor in science, preserve this peaceful attitude, I quote from Mr. Hugo’s _Textbook of the History of Roman Law_. In this work Mr. Hugo says (5th edition § 53) that “Cicero praises the twelve tables with a side glance at philosophy, ... but the philosopher Phavorinus treats them exactly as many a great philosopher since has treated positive right.” Mr. Hugo makes the ultimate reply to such a method as that of Phavorinus, when he says of him that he “understood the twelve tables just as little as the philosophers understood positive right.” The correction of the philosopher Phavorinus by the jurist Sextus Caecilius (Gellius. “Noct. Attic." xx. 1) expresses the lasting and true principle of the justification of that which is in its content merely positive. “_Non ignoras_,” as Caecilius felicitously remarks to Phavorinus, "_legum opportunitates et medelas pro temporum moribus, et pro rerum publicarum generibus, ac pro utilitatum praesentium rationibus, proque vitiorum, quibus medendum est, fervoribus mutari ae flecti, neque uno statu consistere, quin, ut facies coeli et maris, ita rerum atque fortunae tempestatibus varientur. Quid salubrius visuin est rogatione illa Stolonis, etc., quid utilius plebiscite Voconio, etc., quid tam necessarium existimatum est, quam lex Licinia, etc.? Omnia tamen haec obliterate et operta sunt civitatis opulentia_,” etc. These laws are Positive so far as they have meaning and appropriateness under the circumstances, and thus have only an historic value. For this reason they are in their nature transient. Whether the legislator or government was wise or not in what it did for its own immediate time and circumstances is a matter quite by itself and is for history to say.

History will the more profoundly recognise the action of the legislator in proportion as its estimate receives support from the philosophic standpoint. From the vindications of the twelve tables against the judgment of Phavorinus I shall give further examples, because in them Caecilius furnishes an illustration of the fraud which is indissolubly bound up with the methods of the understanding and its reasoning. He adduces a good reason for a bad thing, and supposes that lie has in that way justified the thing. Take the horrible law which permitted a creditor, after the lapse of a fixed term of respite, to kill a debtor or sell him into slavery. Nay, further, if there were several creditors, they were permitted to cut pieces off the debtor, and thus divide him amongst them, with the proviso that if any one of them should cut off too much or too little, no action should be taken against him.

It was this malaise, it may be noticed, which stood Shakespeare’s Shylock in _The Merchant of Venice_ in such good stead, and was by him most thankfully accepted. Well, for this law Caecilius adduces the good argument that by it trust and credit were more firmly secured, and also that, by reason of the very horror of the law, it never had to be enforced. Not only does he in his want of thought fail to observe that by the severity of the law that very intention of securing trust and credit was defeated, but lie forthwith himself gives an illustration of the way in which the disproportionate punishment caused the law to be inoperative, namely through the habit of giving false witness. But the remark of Mr. Hugo that, Phavorinus bad not understood the law is not to be passed over. Now any schoolboy can understand the law just quoted, and better than anyone else would Shylock have understood what was to him of such advantage. Hence, by “understand" Mr. Hugo must mean that form of understanding which consists in brining to the support of a law a good reason. Another failure to understand, asserted by Caecilius of Phavorinus, a philosopher at any rate may without blushing acknowledge: _jumentum_, which without any _arcera_ was the only legal way to bring a sick man into court as a witness, was held to mean not only t horse but also a carriage or wagon. Further on in this raw Caecilius found more evidence of the excellence and accuracy of the old statutes, which for the purpose of non-suiting a sick man at court distinguished not only between a horse and a wagon, but also, as Caecilius explains, between a wagon covered and cushioned and one not so comfortably equipped. Thus one would have the choice between utter severity on one side, and on the other senseless details. But to exhibit fully the absurdity of these laws and the pedantic defence offered in their behalf would give rise to an invincible repugnance to all scholarship of that kind.

But in his manual Mr. Hugo speaks also of rationality in (connection with Roman law, and I have been struck with the following remarks. He first of all treats of the epoch extending from the origin of the Republic to the twelve tables (§§ 38, 39), noticing that in Rome people had many wants, and were compelled in their labour to use draught animals and beasts of burden, as we ourselves do, and that the ground was an alternation of hill and valley that the city was set upon a hill, etc. These statements might, perhaps, have answered to the sense of Montesquieu’s thought, though in them it would be well-nigh impossible to find his genius. But after these preliminary paragraphs, he goes on to say in § 40, that the condition of the law was still very far from satisfying the highest demands of reason. This remark is wholly in place, as the Roman family-right, slavery, etc., give no satisfaction to the smallest demands of reason. Yet when discussing the succeeding epochs, Mr. Hugo forgets to tell us in what particulars, if any, the Roman law has satisfactorily met the highest demands of reason. Still of the classic jurists. who flourished in the era of the greatest expansion of Roman law as a science, it is said (§ 289) that “it has been long since been observed that the Roman jurists were educated in philosophy,” but “few know” (more will know now through the numerous editions of Mr. Hugo’s manual) “that there is no class of writers, who, as regards deduction from principles, deserved to be placed beside the mathematicians, and also, as regards the quite remarkable way in which they develop their conceptions, beside the modern founder of metaphysic ; as voucher for this assertion is the notable fact that nowhere do so many trichotomies occur as in the classic jurists and in Kant.”

This form of logical reasoning, extolled by Leibnitz, is certainly an essential feature of the science of right, as it is of mathematics and every other intelligible science; but the logical procedure of the mere understanding, spoken of by Mr. Hugo, has nothing to do with the satisfaction of the claims of reason and with philosophic science. Moreover, the very lack of logical procedure, which is characteristic of the Roman jurists and proctors, is to be esteemed as one of their chief virtues, since by means of it they obviated the consequences of unrighteous and horrible institutions. Through their want of logic they were compelled _callide_ to put sense into mere verbal distinctions, as they did when they identified _Bonorum possessio_ with inheritance, and also into silly evasions, for silliness is a defect of logic, in order to save the letter of the tables, as was done in the _fictio_ or _hypokrisis_ that a _filia patroni_ was a _filius_ (Heineec. _Antiq. Rom_., lib. i. tit. ii. § 24). But it is absurd to place the classic jurists, with their use of trichotomy, along with Kant, and in that way to discern in them the promise of the development of conceptions.

§ 4

The territory of right is in general the spiritual, and its more definite place and origin is the will, which is free. Thus freedom constitutes the substance and essential character of the will, and the system of right is the kingdom of actualised freedom. It is the world of spirit, which is produced out of itself, and is a second nature.

Addition: Freedom of will is best explained by reference to physical nature. Freedom is a fundamental phase of will, as weight is of bodies. When it is said that matter is heavy, it might be meant that the predicate is an attribute; but such is not the case, for in matter there is nothing which has not weight; in fact, matter is weight. That which is heavy constitutes the body, and is the body. Just so is it with freedom and the will; that which is free is the will. Will without freedom is an empty word, and freedom becomes actual only as will, as subject. A remark may also be made as to the connection of willing and thinking. Spirit, in general, is thought, and by thought man is distinguished from the animal. But we must not imagine that man is on one side thinking and on another side willing, as though he had will in one pocket and thought in another. Such an idea is vain. The distinction between thought and will is only that between a theoretical and a practical relation. They are not two separate faculties. The will is a special way of thinking; it is thought translating itself into reality; it is the impulse of thought to give itself reality. The distinction between thought and will may be expressed in this way. When I think an object, I make of it a thought, and take from it the sensible. Thus I make of it something which is essentially and directly mine. Only in thought am I self-contained. Conception is the penetration of the object, which is then no longer opposed to me. From it I have taken its own peculiar nature, which it had as an independent object in opposition to me. As Adam said to Eve, “thou art flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone," so says the spirit, “This object is spirit of my spirit, and all alienation has disappeared.” Any idea is a universalising, and this process belongs to thinking. To make something universal is to think. The “I” is thought and the universal. When I say “I,” I let fall all particularity of character, natural endowment, knowledge, age. The I is empty, a point and simple, but in its simplicity active. The gaily coloured world is before me ; I stand opposed to it, and in this relation I cancel and transcend the opposition, and make the content my own. The I is at home in the world, when it knows it, and still more when it has conceived it.

So much for the theoretical relation. The practical, on the other hand, begins with thinking, with the I itself. It thus appears first of all as placed in opposition, because it exhibits, as it were, a separation. As I am practical, I am active; I act and determine myself; and to determine myself means to set up a distinction. But these distinctions are again mine, my own determinations come to me; and the ends are mine, to which I am impelled. Even when I let these distinctions and determinations go, setting them in the so-called external world, they remain mine. They are that which I have done and made, and bear the trace of my spirit. That is the distinction to be drawn between the theoretical and the practical relations.

And now the connection of the two must be also stated. The theoretical is essentially contained in the practical. Against the idea that the two are separate runs the fact that man has no will without intelligence. The will holds within itself the theoretical, the will determines itself, and this determination is in the first instance internal. That which I will I place before my mind, and it is an object for me. The animal acts according to instinct, is impelled by something internal, and so is also practical. But it has no will, because it cannot place before its mind what it desires. Similarly man cannot use his theoretic faculty or think without will, for in thinking we are active. The content of what is thought receives, indeed, the form of something existing, but this existence is occasioned by our activity and by it, established. These distinctions of theoretical and practical are inseparable; they are one and the same; and in every activity, whether of thought or will, both these elements are found.

It is worth while to recall the older way of proceeding with regard to the freedom of the will. First of all, the idea of the will was assumed, and then an effort was made to deduce from it and establish a definition of the will. Next, the method of the older empirical psychology was adopted, and different perceptions and general phenomena of the ordinary consciousness were collected, such as remorse, guilt, and the like, on the ground that these could be explained only as proceeding out of a will that is free. Then from these phenomena was deduced the so-called proof that the will is free. But it is more convenient to take a short cut and hold that freedom is given as a fact of consciousness, and must be believed in.

The nature of the will and of freedom, and the proof that the will is free, can be shown, as has already been observed (**[§ 2](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR2)**), only in connection with the whole. The ground principles of the premises that spirit is in the first instance intelligence, and that the phases, through which it passes in its development, namely from feeling, through imaginative thinking to thought, are the way by which it produces itself as will, which, in turn, as the practical spirit in general, is the most direct truth of intelligence - I have presented in my **[_Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ol/encycind.htm)** (1817), and hope some day to be able to give of them a more complete exposition. There is, to my mind, so much the more need for me to give my contribution to, as I hope, the more thorough knowledge of the nature of spirit, since, as I have there said, it would be difficult to find a philosophic science in a more neglected and evil plight than is that theory of spirit, which is commonly called psychology. Some elements of the conception of will, resulting from the premises enumerated above are mentioned in this and the following paragraphs. As to these, appeal may moreover be made to every individual to see them in his own self-consciousness. Everyone will, in the first place, find in himself the ability to abstract himself from all that he is, and in this way prove himself able of himself to set every content within himself, and thus have in his own consciousness an illustration of all the subsequent phases.

§ 5

The will contains [a] the element of pure indeterminateness, i.e., the pure doubling of the I back in thought upon itself. In this process every limit or content, present though it be directly by way of nature, as in want, appetite or impulse, or given in any specific way, is dissolved. Thus we have the limitless infinitude of absolute abstraction, or universality, the pure thought of itself.

Remark: Those who treat thinking and willing as two special peculiar and separate faculties, and, further, look upon thought as detrimental to the will, especially the good will, show from the very start that they know nothing of the nature of willing, a remark which we shall be called upon to a number of times upon the same attitude of mind. The will on one side is the possibility of abstraction from every aspect in which the I finds itself or has set itself up. It reckons any content as a limit, and flees from it. This is one of the forms of the self-direction of the will, and is by imaginative thinking insisted upon as of itself freedom. It is the negative side of the will, or freedom as apprehended by the understanding. This freedom is that of the void, which his taken actual shape, and is stirred to passion. It, while remaining purely theoretical, appears in Hindu religion as the fanaticism of pure contemplation; but becoming actual it assumes both in politics and religion the form of a fanaticism, which would destroy the established social order, remove all individuals suspected of desiring any kind of order, and demolish any organisation which then sought to rise out of the ruins only in devastation does the negative will feel that it has reality. It intends, indeed, to bring to pass some positive social condition, such as universal equality or universal religious life. But in fact it does not will the positive reality of any such condition, since that would carry in its train a system, and introduce a separation by way of institutions and between individuals. But classification and objective system attain self consciousness only by destroying negative freedom. Negative freedom is actuated by a mere solitary idea, whose realisation is nothing but the fury of desolation.

Addition: This phase of will implies that I break loose from everything, give up all ends, and bury myself in abstraction. It is man alone who can let go everything, even life. He can commit suicide, an act impossible for the animal, which always remains only negative, abiding in a state foreign to itself, to which it must merely get accustomed. Man is pure thought of himself, and only in thinking has he the power to give himself universality and distinguish in himself all that is particular and definite.

Negative freedom, or freedom of the understanding, is one-sided, yet as this one-sidedness contains an essential feature, it is not to be discarded. But the defect of the understanding is that it exalts its one-sidedness to the sole highest place. This form of freedom frequently occurs in history. By the Hindus, e.g., the highest freedom is declared to be persistence in the consciousness of one’s simple identity with himself, to abide in the empty space of one’s own inner being, like the colourless light of pure intuition, and to renounce every activity of life, every purpose and every idea. In this way man becomes Brahma; there is no longer any distinction between finite man and Brahma, every difference having been swallowed up in this universality. A more concrete manifestation of this freedom is fanaticism of political and religious life. Of this nature was the terrible epoch of the French Revolution, by which all distinctions in talent and authority were to have been superseded. In this time of upheaval and commotion any specific thing was intolerable. Fanaticism wills an abstraction and not an articulate association. It finds all distinctions antagonistic to its indefiniteness, and supersedes them. Hence in the French Revolution the people abolished the institutions which they themselves had set up, since every institution is inimical to the abstract self-consciousness of equality.

§ 6

[b] The I is also the transition from blank indefiniteness to the distinct and definite establishment of a definite content and object, whether this content be given by nature or produced out of the conception of spirit. Through this establishment of itself as a definite thing the I becomes a reality. This is the absolute element of the finitude or specialisation of the I.

Remark: This second element in the characterisation of the I is just as negative as the first, since it annuls and replaces the first abstract negativity. As the particular is contained in the universal, so this second phase is contained already in the first, and is only an establishing of what the first is implicitly. The first phase, if taken independently, is not the true infinitude, i.e., the concrete universal, or the conception, but limited and one-sided. In that it is the abstraction from all definite character, it has a definite character. Its abstract and one-sided nature constitutes its definite character, its defect and finitude.

The distinct characterisation of these two phases of the I is found in the philosophy of Fichte as also in that of Kant. Only, in the exposition of Fichte the I, when taken as unlimited, as it is in the first proposition of his _Wissenschaftslehre_, is merely positive. It is the universality and identity made by the understanding. Hence this abstract I is in its independence to be taken as the truth, to which by way of mere addition comes in the second proposition, the limitation, or the negative in general, whether it be in the form of a given external limit or of an activity of the I. To apprehend the negative as immanent in the universal or self-identical, and also as in the I, was the next step, which speculative philosophy had to make. Of this want they have no presentiment, who like Fichte never apprehend that the infinite and finite are, if separated, abstract, and must be seen as immanent one in the other.

Addition: This second element makes its appearance as the opposite of the first ; it is to be understood in its general form: it belongs to freedom but does not constitute the whole of it. Here the I passes over from blank indeterminateness to the distinct establishment of a specific character as a content or object. I do not will merely, but I will something. Such a will, as is analysed in the preceding paragraph, wills only the abstract universal, and therefore wills nothing. Hence it is not a will. The particular thing, which the will wills is a limitation, since the will, in order to be a will, must in general limit itself. Limit or negation consists in the will willing something Particularising is thus as a rule named finitude. Ordinary reflection holds the first element, that of the indefinite, for the absolute and higher. and the limited for a mere negation of this indefiniteness. But this indefiniteness is itself only a negation, in contrast with the definite and finite. The I is solitude and absolute negation. The indefinite will is thus quite as much one-sided as the will, which continues merely in the definite.

§ 7

[c] The will is the unity of these two elements. It is particularity turned back within itself and thus led back to universality; it is individuality; it is the self-direction of the I. Thus at one and the same time it establishes itself as its own negation, that is to say, as definite and limited, and it also abides by itself, in its self-identity and universality, and in this position remains purely self-enclosed. The I determines itself in so far as it is the reference of negativity to itself ; and yet in this self-reference it is indifferent to its own definite character. This it knows as its own, that is, as an ideal or a mere possibility, by which it is not bound, but rather exists in it merely because it establishes itself there. This is the freedom of the will, constituting its conception or substantive reality. It is its gravity, as it were, just as gravity is the substantive reality of a body.

Remark: Every self-consciousness knows itself as at once universal, or the possibility of abstracting itself from everything definite, and as particular, with a fixed object, content or aim. These two elements, however, are only abstractions. The concrete and true, and all that is true is concrete, is the universality, to which the particular is at first opposed, but, when it has been turned back into itself, is in the end made equal. This unity is individuality, but it is not a simple unit as is the individuality of imaginative thought, but a unit in terms of the conception (_Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences_, §§ 112-114). In other words, this individuality is properly nothing else than the conception. The first two elements of the will, that it can abstract itself from everything, and that it is definite through either its own activity or something else, are easily admitted and comprehended, because in their separation they are untrue, and characteristic of the mere understanding. But into the third, the true and speculative - and all truth, as far as it is conceived, must be thought speculatively - the understanding declines to venture, always calling the conception the inconceivable. The proof and more detailed explanation of this inmost reserve of speculation, of infinitude as the negativity which refers itself to itself, and of this ultimate source of all activity, life and consciousness, belong to logic, as the purely speculative philosophy. Here it can be noticed only in passing that, in the sentences, “The will is universal. ... The will directs itself,” the will is already regarded as presupposed subject or substratum; but it is not something finished and universal before it determines itself, nor yet before this determination is superseded and idealised. It is will only when its activity is self-occasioned, and it has returned into itself.

Addition: What we properly call will contains the two above-mentioned elements. The I is, first of all, as such, pure activity, the universal which is by itself. Next this universal determines itself, and so far is no longer by itself, but establishes itself as another, and ceases to be the universal. The third step is that the will, while in this limitation, i.e., in this other, is by itself. While it limits itself, it yet remains with itself, and does not lose its hold of the universal. This is, then, the concrete conception of freedom, while the other two elements have been thoroughly abstract and one-sided. But this concrete freedom we already have in the form of perception, as in friendship and love. Here a man is not one-sided, but limits himself willingly in reference to another, and yet in this limitation knows himself as himself. In this determination he does not feel himself determined, but in the contemplation of the other as another has the feeling of himself. Freedom also lies neither in indeterminateness nor in determinateness, but in both. The wilful man has a will which limits itself wholly to a particular object, and if he has not this will, he supposes himself not to be free. But the will is not bound to a particular object, but must go further, for the nature of the will is not to be one-sided and confined. Free will consists in willing a definite object, but in so doing to be by itself and to return again into the universal.

§ 8

If we define this particularising ([b] § 6) further, we reach a distinction in the forms of the will. (a) In so far as the definite character of the will consists in the formal opposition of the subjective to the objective or external direct existence, we have the formal will as a self consciousness which finds an outer world before it. The process by which individuality turns back in its definiteness into itself, is the translation of the subjective end, through the intervention of an activity and a means, into objectivity. In the absolute spirit, in which all definite character is thoroughly its own and true ([_Encyclopaedia_. § 440](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sp/suspirit.htm#SU440)), consciousness is only one side, namely, the manifestation or appearance of the will, a phase which does not require detailed consideration here.

Addition: The consideration of the definite nature of the will belongs to the understanding, and is not in the first instance speculative. The will as a whole, not only in the sense of its content, but also in the sense of its form, is determined. Determinate character on the side of form is the end, and the execution of the end. The end is at first merely something internal to me and subjective, but it is to be also objective and to cast away the defect of mere subjectivity. It may be asked, why it has this defect. When that which is deficient does not at the same time transcend its defect, the defect is for it not a defect at all. The animal is to us defective, but not for itself. The end, in so far as it is at first merely ours, is for us a defect, since freedom and will are for us the unity of subjective and objective. The end must also be established as objective; but does not in that way attain a new one-sided character, but rather its realisation.

§ 9

(b). In so far as the definite phases of will are its own peculiar property or its particularisation turned back into itself, they are content. This content, as content of the will, is for it, by virtue of the form given in (a), an end, which exists on its inner or subjective side as the imaginative will, but by the operation of the activity, which converts the subjective into the objective, it is realised, completed end.

§ 10

The content or determinate phase of will is in the first instance direct or immediate. Then the will is free only in itself or for us, i.e., it is the will in its conception. Only when it has itself as an object is it also for itself, and its implicit freedom becomes realised.

Remark: At this standpoint the finite implies that whatever is in itself, or according to its conception, has an existence or manifestation different from what it is for itself. For example the abstract separateness of nature is in itself space, but for itself time. Here, two things are to be observed,

1. that because the truth is the idea, when any object or phase is apprehended only as it is in itself or in conception, it is not as yet apprehended in its truth, and yet

2. that, whatever exists as conception or in itself, at the same time exists, and this existence is a peculiar form of the object, as _e.g._ space.

The separation of existence in-itself or implicit existence from existence-for-itself or explicit existence is a characteristic of the finite, and constitutes its appearance or merely external reality. An example of this is to hand in the separation of the natural will from formal right. The understanding adheres to mere implicit existence, and in accordance with this position calls freedom a capacity, since it is at this point only a possibility. But the understanding, regards this phase as absolute and perennial, and considers the relation of the will to what it wills or reality as an application to a given material, which does not belong to the essence of freedom. In this way the understanding occupies itself with mere abstractions, and not with the idea and truth.

Addition: The will, which is will only according to the conception, is free implicitly, but is at the same time not free. To be truly free. it must have a truly fixed content; then it is explicitly free, has freedom for its object, and is freedom. What is at first merely in conception, i.e., implicit, is only direct and natural, We are familiar with this in pictorial thought also. The child is implicitly a man, at first has reason implicitly, and is at first the possibility of reason and freedom. He is thus free merely according to the conception. That which is only implicit does not yet exist in actuality. A man, who is implicitly rational, must create himself by working through and out of himself and by reconstructing himself within himself, before he can become also explicitly rational.

§ 11

The will, which is at first only implicitly free, is the direct or natural will. The distinctive phases, which the self-determining conception sets up in the will, appear in the direct will, as a directly present content. They are impulses, appetites, inclinations, by which the will finds itself determined by nature. Now this content, with all its attendant phases, proceeds from the rationality of the will, and is therefore implicitly rational; but let loose in its immediate directness it has not as yet the form of rationality. The content is indeed for me and my own, but the form and the content are yet different. The will is thus in itself finite.

Note. Empirical psychology enumerates and describes these impulses and inclinations, and the wants which are based upon them. It takes, or imagines that it takes this material from experience, and then seeks to classify it in the usual way. It will be stated below, what the objective side of impulse is, and what impulse is in its truth, apart from the form of irrationality which it has as an impulse, and also what shape it assumes when it reaches existence.

Addition: Impulse, appetite, inclination are possessed by the animal also, but it has not will; it must obey impulse, if there is no external obstacle. Man, however, is the completely undetermined, and stands above impulse, and may fix and set it up as his. Impulse is in nature, but it depends on my will whether I establish it in the I. Nor can the will be unconditionally called to this action by the fact that the impulse lies in nature.

§ 12

The system of this content, as it occurs directly in the will, exists only as a multitude or multiplicity of impulses, every one of which is mine in a general way along with others, but is at the same time universal and undetermined, having many objects and ways of satisfaction. The will, by giving itself in this two-fold indefiniteness the form of individuality (**[§ 7](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR7)**), resolves, and only as resolving is it actual.

Remark: Instead of to “resolve” (_beschließen_), i.e. to supersede the indefinite condition in which a content is merely possible, our language has the expression “unfold itself” (_sich entschließen_). The indeterminate condition of the will, as neutral but infinitely fruitful germ of all existence, contains within itself its definite character and ends, and brings them forth solely out of itself.

§ 13

By resolution, will fixes itself as the will of a definite individual, and as thereby distinguishing itself from another. However apart from this finite character which it has as consciousness (**[§ 8](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR8)**), the immediate will is in virtue of the distinction between its form and its content formal. Hence its resolution as such is abstract, and its content is not yet the content and work of its freedom.

Remark: To the intelligence, as thinking, the object or content remains universal ; the intelligence retains the form merely of a universal activity. Now the universal signifies in will that which is mine, i.e. it is individuality. And yet, also, the direct and formal will is abstract ; its individuality is not yet filled with its free universality. Hence at the beginning the peculiar finitude of the intelligence is in will, and only by exalting itself again to thought and giving itself intrinsic universality does the will transcend the distinction of form and content and make itself objective infinite will. It is therefore a misunderstanding of the nature of thought and will to suppose that in the will man is infinite, while in thought and even in reason he is limited. In so far as thought and will are still distinct, the reverse is rather the case, and thinking reason, when it becomes will, assigns itself to finitude.

Addition: A will which resolves nothing, is not an actual will; that which is devoid of definite character never reaches a volition. The reason for hesitation may lie in a sensitiveness, which is aware that in determining itself it is engaged with what is finite, is assigning itself a limit, and abandoning its infinity ; it may thus hold to its decision not to renounce the totality which it intends. Such a feeling is dead, even when it aims to be something beautiful. “Who will be great,” says Goethe, “must be able to limit himself." By volition alone man enters actuality, however distasteful it may be to him; for indolence will not desert its own self-brooding, in which it clings to a universal possibility. But possibility is not yet actuality. Hence the will, which is secure simply of itself, does not as yet lose itself in any definite reality.

§ 14

The finite will, which has merely from the standpoint of form doubled itself back upon itself, and has become the infinite and self-secluded I (**[§ 5](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR5)**), stands above its content of different impulses and also above the several ways by which they are realised and satisfied. At the same time, as it is only formally infinite, it is confined to this very content as the decisive feature of its nature and external actuality, although it is undetermined and not confined to one content rather than another (**[§§ 6, 11](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR6)**). As to the return of the I into itself such a will is only a possible will, which may or may not be mine, and the I is only the possibility of deputing itself (_befruchten_) to this or that object. Hence amongst these definite phases, which in this light are for the I external, the will chooses.

§ 15

Freedom of the will is, in this view of it, caprice, in which are contained both a reflection, which is free and abstracted from everything and a dependence upon a content or matter either internally or externally provided. Since the content is in itself or implicitly necessary as an end, and in opposition to this reflection is a definite possibility, caprice, when it is will, is in its nature contingent.

Remark: The usual idea of freedom is that of caprice. It is a midway stage of reflection between the will as merely natural impulse and the will as free absolutely. When it is said that freedom as a general thing consists in doing what one likes, such an idea must be taken to imply an utter lack of developed thought, containing as yet not even the suspicion of what is meant by the absolutely free will, right, the ethical system, etc. Reflection, being the formal universality and unity of self-consciousness, is the will’s abstract certitude of its freedom, but it is not yet the truth of it, because it has not as yet itself for content and end; the subjective side is still different from the objective. Thus the content in such a case remains purely and completely finite. Caprice, instead of being will in its truth, is rather will in its contradiction.

In the controversy carried on, especially at the time of the metaphysic of Wolf, as to whether the will is really free or our consciousness of its freedom is a delusion, it was this caprice, which was in the minds of both parties. Against the certitude of abstract self-direction, determinism rightly opposed a content, which was externally presented, and not being contained in this certitude came from without. It did not matter whether this “without" were impulse, imagination, or in general a consciousness so filled that the content was not the peculiar possession of the self-activity as such. Since only the formal element of free self-direction is immanent in caprice, while the other element is something given to it from without, to take caprice as freedom may fairly be named a delusion. Freedom in every philosophy of reflection, whether it be the Kantian or the Friesian, which is the Kantian superficialised, is nothing more than this formal self-activity.

Addition: Since I have the possibility of determining myself in this or that way, since I have the power of choice, possess caprice, or what is commonly called freedom. This choice is due to the universality of the will, enabling me to make my own this thing or another. This possession is a particular content, which is therefore not adequate to me, but separated from me, and is mine only in possibility; just as I am the possibility of bringing myself into coincidence with it. Hence choice is due to the indeterminateness of the I, and to the determinateness of a content. But as to this content the will is not free, although it has in itself formally the side of infinitude. No such content corresponds to will ; in no content can it truly find itself. In caprice it is involved that the content is not formed by the nature of my will, but by contingency. I am dependent upon this content. This is the contradiction contained in caprice. Ordinary man believes that he is free, when he is allowed to act capriciously, but precisely in caprice is it inherent that he is not free. When I will the rational, I do not act as a particular individual but according to the conception of ethical life in general. In an ethical act I establish not myself but the thing. A man, who acts perversely, exhibits particularity. The rational is the highway on which every one travels, and no one is specially marked. When a great artist finishes a work we say: “It must be so.” The particularity of the artist has wholly disappeared and the work shows no mannerism. Phidias has no mannerism; the statue itself lives and moves. But the poorer is the artist, the more easily we discern himself, his particularity all caprice. If we adhere to the consideration that in caprice a man can will what he pleases, we have certainly freedom of a kind; but again, if we hold to the view that the content is given, then man must be determined by it, and in this light is no longer free.

§ 16

What is resolved upon and chosen (§ 14) the will may again give up (§ 5). Yet, even with the possibility of transcending any other content which it may substitute, and of proceeding in this way _ad infinitum,_ the will does not advance beyond finitude, because every content in turn is different from the form and is finite. The opposite aspect, namely indeterminateness, irresolution or abstraction, is also one-sided.

§ 17

Since the contradiction involved in caprice (§ 15) is the dialectic of the impulses and inclinations, it is manifested in their mutual antagonism. The satisfaction of one demands the subjection and sacrifice of the satisfaction of another. Since an impulse is merely the simple tendency of its own essential nature, and has no measure in itself, to subject or sacrifice the satisfaction of any impulse is a contingent decision of caprice. In such a case caprice may act upon the calculation as to which impulse will bring the greater satisfaction, or may have some other similar purpose.

Addition: Impulses and inclinations are in the first instance the content of will, and only reflection transcends them. But these impulses are self-directing, crowding upon and jostling one another, and all seeking to be satisfied. To set all but one in the background, and put myself into this one, is to limit and distort myself, since I, in so doing, renounce my universality, which is a system of the impulses. Just as little help is found in a mere subordination of them, a course usually followed by the understanding. There is available no criterion by which to make such an arrangement, and hence the demand for a subordination is usually sustained by tedious and irrelevant allusions to general savings.

§ 18

With regard to the moral estimate of impulses, dialectic appears in this form. The phases of the direct or natural will are immanent and positive, and thus good. Hence man is by nature good. But natural characteristics, since they are opposed to freedom and the conception of the spirit, and are, hence, negative, must be eradicated. Thus man is by nature evil. To decide for either view is a matter of subjective caprice.

Addition: The Christian doctrine that man is by nature evil is loftier than the opposite that he is naturally good, and is to be interpreted philosophically in this way. Man as spirit is a free being, who need not give way to impulse. Hence in his direct and unformed condition, man is in a situation in which he ought not to be, and he must free himself. This is the meaning of the doctrine of original sin, without which Christianity would not be the religion of freedom.

§ 19

In the demand that impulses must be purified is found the general idea that they must be freed from the form of direct subjection to nature, and from a content that is subjective and contingent, and must be restored to their substantive essence. The truth contained in this indefinite demand is that impulses should be phases of will in a rational system. To apprehend them in this way as proceeding from the conception is the content of the science of right.

Remark: The content of this science may, in all its several elements, right, property, morality, family, state, be represented in this way, that man has by nature the impulse to right, the impulse to property, to morality, to sexual love, and to social life. If instead of this form, which belongs to empirical psychology, a philosophic form be preferred, it may be obtained cheap from what, in modern times was reputed and still is reputed to be philosophy. He will then say that man finds in himself as a fact of consciousness that he wills right, property, the state, etc. Later will be given still another form of the content which appears here in the shape of impulses, that, namely, of duties.

§ 20

The reflection which is brought to bear upon impulses, placing them before itself, estimating them, comparing them with one another, and contrasting them with their means and consequences, and also with a whole of satisfaction, namely happiness, brings the formal universal to this material, and in an external way purifies it of its crudity and barbarism. This propulsion by the universality of thought is the absolute worth of civilisation [_Bildung_] (**[§ 187](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm#PR187)**).

Addition: In happiness thought has already the upper hand with the force of natural impulse, since it is not satisfied with what is momentary, but requires happiness as a whole. This happiness is dependent upon civilisation [_Bildung_] to the extent to which civilisation confirms the universal. But in the ideal of happiness there are two elements. There is

a universal that is higher than all particulars; yet, as the content of this universal is in turn only universal pleasure, there arises once more the individual, particular and finite, and retreat must be made to impulse;

Since the content of happiness lies in the subjective perception of each individual, this universal end is again particular; nor is there present in it any true unity of content and form.

§ 21

But the truth of this formal universality, which taken by itself is undetermined and finds definite character in externally given material, is the self-directing universality which is will or freedom. Since the will has as its object, content and end, universality itself, and thus assumes the form of the infinite, it is free not only in itself or implicitly, but for itself or explicitly. It is the true idea.

Remark: The self-consciousness of the will in the form of appetite or impulse is sensible, the sensible in general indicating the externality of self-consciousness, or that condition in which self-consciousness is outside of itself. Now this sensible side is one of the two elements of the reflecting will, and the other is the abstract universality of thought. But the absolute will has as its object the will itself as such in its pure universality. In this universality the directness of the natural will is superseded, and so also is the private individuality which is produced by reflection and infects the natural condition. But to supersede these and lift them into the universal, constitutes the activity of thought. Thus the self-consciousness, which purifies its object, content or end, and exalts it to universality, is thought carrying itself through into will. It is at this point that it becomes clear that the will is true and free only as thinking intelligence. The slave knows not his essence, his infinitude, his freedom; he does not know himself in his essence, and not to know himself is not to think himself. The self-consciousness, which by thought apprehends that itself is essence, and thus puts away from itself the accidental and untrue, constitutes the principle of right, morality, and all forms of ethical life. They who, in speaking philosophically of right, morality, and ethical life, would exclude thought and turn to feeling, the heart, the breast, and inspiration, express the deepest contempt for thought and science. And science itself, overwhelmed with despair and utter insipidity, makes barbarism and absence of thought a principle, and so far as in it lay robbed men of all truth, dignity, and worth.

Addition: In philosophy truth is had when the conception corresponds to reality. A body is the reality, and soul is the conception. Soul and body should be adequate to each other. A dead man is still an existence, but no longer a true existence; it is a reality void of conception. For that reason the dead body decays. So with the true will; that which it wills, namely, its content, is identical with it, and so freedom wills freedom.

§ 22

The will which exists absolutely is truly infinite, because its object being the will itself, is for it not another or a limitation. In the object the will has simply reverted into itself. Moreover, it is not mere possibility, capacity, potentiality (potential, but infinitely actual (_infinitum actu_), because the reality of the conception or its visible externality is internal to itself.

Remark: Hence when the free will is spoken of without the qualification of absolute freedom, only the capacity of freedom is meant, or the natural and finite will (**[§ 11](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR11)**), and, notwithstanding all words and opinions to the contrary, not the free will. Since the understanding comprehends the infinite only in its negative aspect, and hence as a beyond, it thinks to do the infinite all the more honour the farther it removes it into the vague distance, and the more it takes it as a foreign thing. In free will the true infinite is present and real; it is itself the actually present self-contained idea.

Addition: The infinite has rightly been represented as a circle. The straight line goes out farther and farther, and symbolises the merely negative and bad infinite, which, unlike the true, does not return into itself. The free will is truly infinite, for it is not a mere possibility or disposition. Its external reality is its own inner nature, itself.

§ 23

Only in this freedom is the will wholly by itself, because it refers to nothing but itself, and all dependence upon any other thing falls away. The will is true, or rather truth itself, because its character consists in its being in its manifested reality, or correlative opposite, what it is in its conception. In other words, the pure conception has the perception or intuition of itself as its end and reality.

§ 24

The will is universal, because in it all limitation and particular individuality are superseded. These one-sided phases are found only in the difference between the conception and its object or content, or, from another standpoint, in the difference between the conscious independent existence of the subject, and the will’s implicit, or self-involved existence, or between its excluding and concluding individuality, and its universality.

Remark: The different phases of universality are tabulated in the logic (_Encyclopaedia. of the Phil. Sciences_, 3rd ed., [§§ 169-178](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slsubjec.htm#SL169)). Imaginative thinking always takes universality in an abstract and external way. But absolute universality is not to be thought of either as the universality of reflection, which is a kind of consensus or generality, or, as the abstract universality and self-identity, which is fashioned by the understanding (**[§ _6,_ note](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PRn6)**), and keeps aloof from the individual. It is rather the concrete, self-contained, and self-referring universality, which is the substance, intrinsic genus, or immanent idea of self-consciousness. It is a conception of free will as the universal, transcending its object, passing through and beyond its own specific character, and then becoming identical with itself. This absolute universal is what is in general called the rational, and is to be apprehended only in this speculative way.

§ 25

The subjective side of the will is the side of its self-consciousness and individuality (**[§ 7](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR7)**), as distinguished from its implicit conception. This subjectivity is

[a] pure form or absolute unity of self-consciousness with itself. This unity is the equation “ I = I,” consciousness being characterised by a thoroughly inward and abstract self-dependence. It is pure certitude of itself in contrast with the truth;  
[b] particularity of will, as caprice with its accidental content of pleasurable ends;  
[c] in general a one-sided form (**[§ 8](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR8)**), in so far as that which is willed is at first an unfulfilled end, or a content which simply belongs to self-consciousness.

§ 26

[a] In so far as free will is determined by itself, and is in accord with its conception and true, it is wholly objective will.  
[b] But objective self-consciousness, which has not the form of the infinite, is a will sunk in its object or condition, whatever the content of that may be. It is the will of the child, or the will present in slavery or superstition.  
[c] Objectivity is finally a one-sided form in opposition to the subjective phase of will ; it is direct reality, or external existence. In this sense the will becomes objective only by the execution of its ends.

Remark: These logical phases of subjectivity and objectivity, since they are often made use of in the sequel, are here exposed, with the express purpose of noting that it happens with them as with other distinctions and opposed aspects of reflection; they by virtue of their finite and dialectic character pass over into their opposites. For imagination and understanding the meanings of antithetic phases are not convertible, because their identity is still internal. But in will, on the contrary, these phases, which ought to be at once abstract and yet also sides of that which can be known only as concrete, lead of themselves to identity, and to an exchange of meaning. To the understanding this is unintelligible. Thus, e.g., the will, as a freedom which exists in itself, is subjectivity itself; thus subjectivity is the conception of the will, and therefore its objectivity. But subjectivity is finite in opposition to objectivity, yet in this opposition the will is not isolated, but in intricate union with the object ; and thus its finitude consists quite as much in its not being subjective, etc. What in the sequel is to be meant by the subjective or the objective side of the will, has each time to be made clear from the context, which will supply their positions in relation to the totality.

Addition: It is ordinarily supposed that subjective and objective are blank opposites ; but this is not the case. Rather do they pass into one another, for they are not abstract aspects like positive and negative, but have already a concrete significance. To consider in the first instance the expression "subjective;” this may mean an end which is merely the end of a certain subject. In this sense a poor work of art, that is not adequate to the thing is merely subjective. But, further, this expression may point to the content of the will, and is then of about the same meaning as capricious; the subjective content then is that which belongs merely to the subject. In this sense bad acts are merely subjective. Further, the pure, empty I may be called subjective, as it has only itself as an object, and possesses the power of abstraction from all further content. Subjectivity has, moreover, a wholly particular and correct meaning in accordance with which anything, in order to win recognition from me, has to become mine and seek validity in me. This is the infinite avarice of subjectivity, eager to comprehend and consume everything within the simple and pure I.

Similarly we may take the objective in different ways. By it we may understand anything to which we give existence in contrast to ourselves, whether it be an actual thing or a mere thought, which we place over against ourselves. By it also we understand the direct reality, in which the end is to be realised. Although the end itself is quite particular and subjective, we yet name it objective after it has made its appearance. Further, the objective will is also that in which truth is; thus, God’s will, the ethical will also, are objective. Lastly, we may call the will objective, when it is wholly submerged in its object, as, _e.g.,_ the child’s will, which is confiding and without subjective freedom, and the slave’s will, which does not know itself as free, and is thus a will-less will. In this sense any will is objective, if it is guided in its action by a foreign authority, and has not yet completed the infinite return into itself.

§ 27

The absolute character or, if you like, the absolute impulse of the free spirit (**[§ 21](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR21)**) is, as has been observed, that its freedom shall be for it an object. It is to be objective in a two-fold sense: it is the rational system of itself, and this system is to be directly real (**[§ 26](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR26)**). There is thus actualised as idea what the will is implicitly. Hence, the abstract conception of the idea of the will is in general the free will which wills the free will.

§ 28

The activity of the will, directed to the task of transcending the contradiction between subjectivity and objectivity, of transferring its end from subjectivity into objectivity, and yet while in objectivity of remaining with itself, is beyond the formal method of consciousness (**[§ 8](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR8)**), in which objectivity is only direct actuality. This activity is the essential development of the substantive content of the idea (**[§ 21](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/printrod.htm#PR21)**). In this development the conception moulds the idea, which is in the first instance abstract, into the totality of a system. This totality as substantive is independent of the opposition between mere subjective end and its realisation, and in both of these forms is the same.

§ 29

That a reality is the realisation of the free will, this is what is meant by a right. Right, therefore, is, in general, freedom as idea.

Remark: In the Kantian doctrine (Introduction to Kant’s _Theory of Right_), now generally accepted, “the highest factor is a limitation of my freedom or caprice, in order that it may be able to subsist alongside of every other individual’s caprice in accordance with a universal law.” This doctrine contains only a negative phase, that of limitation. And besides, the positive phase, the universal law or so-called law of reason, consisting in the agreement of the caprice of one with that of another, goes beyond the well-known formal identity and the proposition of contradiction. The definition of right, just quoted, contains the view which has especially since Rousseau spread widely. According to this view neither the absolute and rational will, nor the true spirit, but the will and spirit of the particular individual in their peculiar caprice, are the substantive and primary basis. When once this principle is accepted, the rational can announce itself only as limiting this freedom. Hence it is not an inherent rationality, but only a mere external and formal universal. This view is accordingly devoid of speculative thought, and is rejected by the philosophic conception. In the minds of men and in the actual world it has assumed a shape, whose horror is without a parallel, except in the shallowness of the thoughts upon which it was founded.

§ 30

Right in general is something holy, because it is the embodiment of the absolute conception and self-conscious freedom. But the formalism of right, and after a while of duty also, is due to distinctions arising out of the development of the conception of freedom. In contrast with the more formal, abstract and limited right, there is that sphere or stage of the spirit, in which spirit has brought to definite actuality the further elements contained in the idea. This stage is the richer and more concrete; it is truly universal and has therefore a higher right.

Remark: Every step in the development of the idea of freedom has its peculiar right, because it is the embodiment of a phase of freedom. When morality and ethical life are spoken of in opposition to right, only the first or formal right of the abstract personality is meant. Morality, ethical life, a state-interest, are every one a special right, because each of these is a definite realisation of freedom. They can come into collision only in so far as they occupy the same plane. If the moral standpoint of spirit were not also a right and one of the forms of freedom, it could not collide with the right of personality or any other right. A right contains the conception of freedom which is the highest phase of spirit, and in opposition to it any other kind of thing is lacking in real substance. Yet collision also implies a limit and a subordination of one phase to another. Only the right of the world-spirit is the unlimited absolute.

§ 31

The scientific method by which the conception is self-evolved, and its phases self-developed and self-produced, is not first of all an assurance that certain relations are given from somewhere or other, and then the application to this foreign material of the universal. The true process is found in the logic, and here is presupposed.

Remark: The efficient or motive principle, which is not merely the analysis but the production of the several elements of the universal, I call dialectic. Dialectic is not that process in which an object or proposition, presented, to feeling or the direct consciousness, is analysed, entangled, taken hither and thither, until at last its contrary is derived. Such a merely negative method appears frequently in Plato. It may fix the opposite of any notion, or reveal the contradiction contained in it, as did the ancient scepticism, or it may in a feeble way consider an approximation to truth, or modern half-and-half attainment of it, as its goal. But the higher dialectic of the conception does not merely apprehend any phase as a limit and opposite, but produces out of this negative a positive content and result. Only by such a course is there development and inherent progress. Hence this dialectic is not the external agency of subjective thinking, but the private soul of the content, which unfolds its branches and fruit organically. Thought regards this development of the idea and of the peculiar activity of the reason of the idea as only subjective, but is on its side unable to make any addition. To consider anything rationally is not to bring reason to it from the outside, and work it up in this way, but to count it as itself reasonable. Here it is spirit in its freedom, the summit of self-conscious reason, which gives itself actuality, and produces itself as the existing world. The business of science is simply to bring the specific work of the reason, which is in the thing, to consciousness.

§ 32

The phases of the development of the conception are themselves conceptions. And yet, because the conception is essentially the idea, they have the form of manifestations. Hence the sequence of the conceptions, which arise in this way, is at the same time a sequence of realisations, and are to be by science so considered.

Remark: In a speculative sense, the way in which a conception is manifested in reality, is identical with a definite phase of the conception. But it is noteworthy that, in the scientific development of the idea, the elements, which result in a further definite form, although preceding this result as phases of the conception, do not in the temporal development go before it as concrete realisations. Thus, as will be seen later, that stage of the idea which is the family presupposes phases of the conception, whose result it is. But that these internal presuppositions should be present in such visible realisations as right of property, contract, morality, etc., this is the other side of the process, which only in a highly developed civilisation has attained to a specific realisation of its elements.

Addition: The idea must always go on determining itself within itself, since at the beginning it is only abstract conception. However, this initial abstract conception is never given up, but only becomes inwardly richer, the last phase being the richest. The earlier and merely implicit phases reach in this way free self-dependence, but in such a manner that the conception remains the soul which holds everything together, and only through a procedure immanent within itself arrives at its own distinctions. Hence the last phase falls again into a unity with the first, and it cannot be said that the conception ever comes to something new. Although the elements of the conception appear to have fallen apart when they enter reality, this is only a mere appearance. Its superficial character is revealed in the process, since all the particulars finally turn back again into the conception of the universal. The empirical sciences usually analyse what they find in pictorial ideas, and if the individual is successfully brought back to the general, the general property is then called the conception. But this is not our procedure. We desire only to observe how the conception determines itself, and compels us to keep at a distance everything of our own spinning and thinking. But what we get in this way is one series of thoughts and another series of realised forms. As to these two series, it may happen that the order of time of the actual manifestations is partly different from the order of the conception. Thus it cannot, e.g., be said that property existed before the family, and yet, in spite of that it is discussed before the family is discussed. The question might also be raised here, Why do we not begin with the highest, i.e., with concrete truth ? The answer is, because we desire to see truth in the form of a result, and it is an essential part of the process to conceive the conception first of all as abstract. The actual series of realisations of the conception is thus for us in due course as follows, even although in actuality the order should be the same. Our process is this, that the abstract forms reveal themselves not as self-subsistent but as untrue.

## Division of the Work.

§ 33

According to the stages in the development of the idea of the absolutely free will,

A. The will is direct or immediate; its conception is therefore, abstract, i.e., personality, and its embodied reality is a direct external thing. This is the sphere of abstract or formal right.

B. The will, passing out of external reality, turns back into itself. Its phase is subjective individuality, and it is contrasted with the universal. This universal is on its internal side the good, and on its external side a presented world, and these two sides are occasioned only by means of each other. In this sphere the idea is divided, and exists in separate elements. The right of the subjective will is in a relation of contrast to the right of the world, or the right of the idea. Here, however, the idea exists only implicitly. This is the sphere of morality.

C. The unity and truth of these two abstract elements. The thought idea of the good is realised both in the will turned back into itself, and also in the external world. Thus freedom exists as real substance, which is quite as much actuality and necessity as it is subjective will. The idea here is its absolutely universal existence, viz., ethical life. This ethical substance is again,

a. Natural spirit; the family,  
b. The civil society, or spirit in its dual existence and mere appearance,  
c. The state, or freedom, which, while established in the free self-dependence of the particular will is also universal and objective. This actual and organic spirit [a] is the spirit of a nation, [b] is found in the relation to one another of national spirits, and [c] passing through and beyond this relation is actualised and revealed in world history as the universal world-spirit, whose right is the highest.

Note. It is to be found in the speculative logic, and here is presupposed, that a thing or content, which is established first of all according to its conception, or implicitly, has the form of direct existence. The conception, however, when it has the form of the conception is explicit, and no longer is a direct existence. So, too, the principle, upon which the division of this work proceeds, is presupposed. The divisions might be regarded as already settled by history, since the different stages must be viewed as elements in the development of the idea, and therefore as springing from the nature of the content itself. A philosophic division is not an external classification of any given material, such a classification as would be made according to one or several schemes picked up at random, but the inherent distinctions of the conception itself. Morality and ethical life, which are usually supposed to mean the same thing, are here taken in essentially different meanings. Meanwhile even imaginative thought seems to make a distinction between them. In the usage of Kant the preference is given to the term morality, and the practical principles of his philosophy limit themselves wholly to this standpoint, making impossible the standpoint of ethical life, and indeed expressly destroying and abolishing it. Although morality and ethics have the same meaning according to their etymology, yet these different words may be used for different conceptions.

Addition: When we speak of right, we mean not only civil right, which is the usual significance of the word, but also morality, ethical life and world-history. These belong to this realm, because the conception taking them in their truth, brings them all together. Free will, in order not to remain abstract, must in the first instance give itself reality; the sensible materials of this reality are objects, i.e., external things. This first phase of freedom we shall know as property. This is the sphere of formal and abstract right, to which belong property in the more developed form of contract and also the injury of right, i.e., crime and punishment. The freedom, we have here, we name person, or, in other words, the subject who is free, and indeed free independently, and gives himself a reality in things. But this direct reality is not adequate to freedom, and the negation of this phase is morality. In morality I am beyond the freedom found directly in this thing, and have a freedom in which this directness is superseded. I am free in myself, i.e., in the subjective. In this sphere we come upon my insight, intention, and end, and externality is established as indifferent. The good is now the universal end, which is not to remain merely internal to me, but to realise itself. The subjective will demands that its inward character, or purpose, shall receive external reality, and also that the good shall be brought to completion in external existence. Morality, like formal right, is also an abstraction, whose truth is reached only in ethical life. Hence ethical life is the unity of the will in its conception with the will of the individual or subject. The primary reality of ethical life is in its turn natural, taking the form of love and feeling. This is the family. In it the individual has transcended his prudish personality, and finds himself with his consciousness in a totality. In the next stage is seen the loss of this peculiar ethical existence and substantive unity. Here the family falls asunder, and the members become independent one of another, being now held together merely by the bond of mutual need. This is the stage of the civil society, which has frequently been taken for the state. But the state does not arise until we reach the third stage, that stage of ethical life or spirit, in which both individual independence and universal substantivity are found in gigantic union. The right of the state is, therefore, higher than that of the other stages. It is freedom in its most concrete embodiment, which yields to nothing but the highest absolute truth of the world-spirit.

# Introduction to the History of Philosophy

THE MATTER UNDER CONSIDERATION HERE IS HISTORY. History’s form is the presentation of a succession of events and deeds. But what are the deeds proper to the history of philosophy? They are the activities of free thought; this means the way the intellectual world has come into being, been produced, developed. What we are to consider, then, is the history of thought.

There is an age-old assumption that thinking distinguishes man from the beast. This we shall accept. What makes man nobler than the beast is what he possesses through thought. Whatever is human is so only to the extent that therein thought is active; no matter what its outward appearance may be, if it is human, thought makes it so. In this alone is man distinguished from the beast.

Still, insofar as thought is in this way the essential, the substantial, the active in man, it has to do with an infinite manifold and variety of objects. Thought will be at its best, however, when it is occupied only with what is best in man, with thought itself, where it wants only itself, has to do with itself alone. For, to be occupied with itself is to discover itself by creating itself;’ and this it can do only by manifesting itself. Thought is active only in producing itself; and it produces itself by its very own activity. It is not simply there; it exists only by being its own producer. What it thus produces is philosophy, and what we have to investigate is the series of such productions, the millennial work of thought in bringing itself forth, the voyage of discovery upon which thought embarks in order to discover itself.

This says in general what our subject-matter is. Still, the statement is so general that there is need to determine more precisely our purpose and the manner of attaining it.

The general remarks we have just made already provide the occasion for further reflection, and it is proper to philosophical consideration to reflect immediately on what has been thought, not to let it be put to use in the way it has been unreflectively thought. As we have said, our subject-matter is the series of free thought’s productions, the history of the intellectual world. The statement is simple, yet it seems to involve a contradiction. The thought which is essentially thought is in and for itself; it is eternal. What truly is is contained only in thought, and it is true not only today and tomorrow but eternally, outside all time, and, to the extent that it is in time, it is forever, at all times, true. Now, right here the contradiction immediately appears, i.e., that thought should have a history. What is presented in history is mutable, has taken place, was once, and is now past, has sunk into the night of the past, is no longer. Thought, however, is not subject to change, it is not something that has been or is past, it is. The question, then, is: how can what is outside history, since it is not subject to change, still have a history?

The second reflection concerns the relation of philosophy to the other forms and products of the spirit. We have already said that man thinks and that precisely this is essential to him. We have also said, however, that thought has purposes other than those of philosophy, that it has to do with a large number of other objects which are also products or activities of thought. Religion, art, statecraft, and the like, are also works of the thinking spirit, and yet they must be kept separate from our theme. The question, then, is: how are these distinguished from the activities of spirit which constitute our subject-matter? Similarly: what historical relation is there between the philosophy of a given time and its religion, art, politics, etc.?

In this Introduction we shall bring out these two points of view in order to orient ourselves regarding the manner in which the history of philosophy is to be handled in these lectures. These two points of view provide a path to a third, to a division which permits a general overview of the total historical process. I shall not, however, concern myself with external reflections on the history of philosophy, such as its usefulness and other things which can be said regarding it. Its usefulness will be revealed in the revelation of philosophy itself.

At the end, however, since this is customary, I shall touch briefly on the sources for the history of philosophy. An Introduction should have only one purpose – to give a more precise picture of what our purpose is. The notion which is to be developed here is the concept itself. This concept does not admit of being proved here (since it is in and for itself); proof of it belongs to the science of philosophy, in the order of logic. The concept does, however, admit of being made acceptable and plausible by being related to other familiar notions (_Vorstellungen_) in ordinary cultivated consciousness. Still, this is not philosophical; it merely contributes to clarity.

First, then, we shall consider the concept, the purpose of the history of philosophy. Secondly, we shall consider the relationship of philosophy to other products of the human spirit, such as art, religion, statecraft, etc., and especially its relation to history itself.

## A. CONCEPT OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY

What we shall here consider is a _succession_ of the manifestations of thought. This is the first and, therefore, the most superficial way in which the history of philosophy appears. Following immediately on this comes the need to become acquainted with its purpose, with the universal through which the diversified plurality manifested in the succession is bound together in such a way that the multiplicity is so related to its own unity as to be formed into a whole, a totality. It is this unity which first of all constitutes the purpose or concept. We are quite correct, then, in wanting to know a purpose or concept in a determinate way before going into detail. We want first of all an overall view of the woods and only after that to know the individual trees. One who looks first at the trees and sticks only to them does not get an overall view of the woods and becomes lost and confused. The same is true of philosophies; they are infinite in number and are conflictingly opposed to each other. One would be confused, then, if one wanted to know first individual philosophies. It would mean failing to see the woods for the trees, failing to see philosophy for philosophies. Nowhere does this happen more readily and more frequently than in the history of philosophy. The multiplicity of philosophies frequently occasions a failure to know and esteem philosophy itself.

On an acquaintance such as this is built the sort of shallow know-it-all claim to show that nothing comes of the history of philosophy. One philosophy contradicts another; the very multiplicity of philosophies proves the inanity of the philosophical endeavor. This is said, presumably in the interests of truth or of what one thinks is the truth: the one thing to be sought is unity, i.e., truth, since truth is one, and the multitude of philosophies, each one claiming to be the true one, contradicts the principle which says that the true is in unity.

Thus, the chief consideration in this Introduction centers on the question: what is the situation here in regard to the contradiction between the unity of truth and the multiplicity of philosophies? What is the result of this long labor of the human spirit, and how is it to be comprehended? What sense do we want to give to our treatment of the history of philosophy?

The history of philosophy is the history of free, concrete thought – which is to say, of reason. Free concrete thought is concerned only with itself. Nothing can be called reason which is not the result of thinking – not, however, of abstract thinking, for that is the thinking proper to understanding, but of concrete thinking, which is reason. The question, then, should be expressed more precisely in this way: in what sense should the history of thinking reason be considered, i.e., what meaning is to be given to it? To this we can answer that no other meaning can be given to it than what is found in the sense of thought itself – or we can say that the question itself does not make sense. We can ask with regard to any thing whatever what its sense or meaning is. Thus, with regard to a work of art we can ask what the picture means, with regard to language what a word means, with regard to religion what a symbol or a ceremony means, with regard to other kinds of activity we can ask about their moral value, etc. The meaning or sense of which we speak is none other than the essential or the universal, the substantial in an object, which is the object concretely thought. Herein we always have a double aspect, an exterior and an interior, an external appearance which is intuitively perceptible and a meaning which, precisely, is thought. Now, because the object with which we are concerned is thought, there is here no double aspect; it is thought itself which does the meaning. Here the object is the universal; so we cannot ask about a meaning which is separate or separable from the object. The only meaning or determination which the history of philosophy has, then, is thought itself. Herein thought is the innermost, the highest, and one cannot, therefore, settle on a thought _about_ it. With regard to a work of art we can reflect on it, advance considerations whether the form corresponds to its meaning; which means we can have a position regarding it. The history of free thought can have no other sense or meaning than that of speaking about the thought itself. The character which here takes the place of sense and meaning is simply the thought.

It is our task now to provide the more precise viewpoints which come into consideration when there is question of thought.

Here we must propose a series of thought-determinations, i.e., we must preface the whole thing with some thoroughly general, abstract concepts, which we shall come back to later, and by applying them get a more precise notion of the concept of history of philosophy. At this point, however, the abstract concepts in question are merely presuppositions; they are not to be treated logically, philosophically, or speculatively, nor are they to be proved. Here it should be sufficient to present these concepts historically and in a provisional way.

### I. Preliminary Notions

The notions (_Bestimmungen_) in question are: thought, concept, idea or reason, and their development.

#### 1. Thought as Concept and Idea

##### a. _Thought._ First, then, there is thought.

(1) _As Concept._ Thought is not something empty and abstract; it is determining, in fact self-determining. In other words, thought is essentially concrete. This concrete thought we call concept. Thought must be a concept; no matter how abstract it may seem to be, of itself (in sich) it must be concrete. As soon as thought is philosophical it is of itself concrete. From one point of view it is correct to say that philosophy deals in abstractions, insofar as it has to do with thoughts, which are abstracted from the sensible, the so-called concrete. From another point of view it is quite incorrect to speak in this way: abstractions belong to the reflection proper to understanding, not to philosophy; and it is precisely those who condemn philosophy for being abstract who are most immersed in the sort of reflections which are proper to understanding, even though they think they have to do with the concretest of contents. Because they reflect on the matter at hand (_die Sache_)_,_ what they have is a combination of the merely sensible and subjective thoughts – i.e., abstractions.

(2) _As Idea._ In more precise terms, concrete thought is concept. Still further determined it _is idea._ The idea is the concept insofar as it is realized. To be realized it must determine itself, and this determination is nothing else but itself. Thus, its content is itself. Its infinite relation to itself, then, means that only from itself does its determination come.

Now, the idea is what we call truth – a large word. To the unprejudiced it will ever continue to be a large word, and it will make his heart swell. Recently, of course, the conclusion has been reached that we are incapable of knowing the truth. The object of philosophy, however, is concrete thought, and when this is further determined it is, precisely, idea or truth. As for the claim that the truth cannot be known, this claim is made specifically (fur _sich_) in the history of philosophy, and when we come to it we shall examine it more closely. Here need only be mentioned that it is to some extent the historians of philosophy themselves who give the prejudice a semblance of validity. Tennemann, for example, who is a Kantian, is of the opinion that it is absurd to want to know the truth; and the proof of this is the history of philosophy. What is difficult to understand is that anyone with this conviction should work so hard at philosophy, could in fact continue to be concerned with it, with no purpose in mind. This sort of thing makes the history of philosophy a mere account of all kinds of opinions, each of which falsely claims to be the truth. Another prejudice says that we can, of course, know about the truth, but only after we have reflected on it (that truth is not known in immediate perception or intuition – neither in external sensible nor in so-called intellectual intuition – since every intuition is as such sensible). I should like to call attention to (_appellieren an_) this prejudice. Granted that it is one thing to be capable of knowing about the truth and another to know the truth. It is only by reflection, however, that I experience what the truth of the matter is. First, then, there is the contention that we cannot know the truth and, secondly, that we know truth only through reflection. If we give a more precise account of these contentions we shall have progressed further in the picture (_Vorstellung_) we are trying to give.

The first determinations we have arrived at, then, are that thought is concrete, that the concrete is truth, and that the truth can be the result only of thinking. To be even more determinate we can say that the spirit develops itself out of itself.

#### 2. Idea as Development

The first point was that thought, free thought, is in itself essentially concrete. This implies that it is alive, that it moves of itself. The infinite nature of spirit is its own process in itself, which means that it does not rest, that it is essentially productive and exists by producing. More precisely we can understand this movement as _development;_ the concrete as active is essentially self-developing. This involves making distinctions; and if we understand more precisely the character of the distinctions involved in the process something different necessarily emerges – the movement turns out to be development. These distinctions come out, even when we stop simply at the familiar notion of development; it is merely a question of reflecting on the notion of development.

**a.** _Being-in-Itself._ With regard to development, what immediately comes to our attention is that there must be something there that develops, which is to say something hidden – the seed, the tendency, the capacity, what Aristotle calls dunamis_,_ i.e., possibility (not some superficial possibility as such, but real possibility), or, as it is called, the in-itself, that which is in itself and at first merely that.

Customarily we have in regard to what is in itself the high opinion that it is what truly is. To get to know God and the world is to get to know them in themselves. What is in itself, however, is not yet the true but only the abstract; it is the seed of what truly is, the tendency, the being-in-itself of the true. It is something simple, something which, of course, contains in itself multiple qualities, but in the form of simplicity – a content which is still hidden.

An example of this is the seed. The seed is simple, almost _a_ point; even through a microscope it can scarcely be seen. This simple thing, however, is pregnant with all the qualities of the tree. In the seed is contained the whole tree, its trunk, branches, leaves, its color, odor, taste, etc. Nevertheless, this simple thing is the seed, not the tree itself; the fully articulated tree does not yet exist. It is essential to know that there is something utterly simple, which in itself contains a manifold, which latter, however, does not yet exist for itself. A more important example is the 1. When I say I, this is the utterly simple, the abstract universal, that which is common to all, for everyone is an I. Still, the I which each one is is the most diverse wealth of notions, drives, desires, inclinations, thoughts, etc. In this simple point, the I, all this is contained. It is the force, the concept of all that man develops out of himself. With Aristotle we can say that in the simple, which is in itself, in the dunamis, _potentia_ in the tendency, _all_ that develops is contained. In development no more comes out than what is already there in itself.

**b.** _Being-there._ What follows is that the in-itself, the simple, the hidden, develops and unfolds. For it to develop means to posit itself, to enter into existence, to be as something distinct. At first it is distinct only in itself, and it exists only in this simplicity or neutrality, like water which is so clear and transparent and yet contains within itself so many physical and chemical materials, even organic possibilities. Whether it is in itself and hidden, or whether it is revealed and, as such, exists, it is one and the same thing, or rather, one and the same content. The difference is simply one of form, but on this difference everything depends.

The big difference consists in this: Man knows what he is, and only when he does so is he actually what he is. Without this, knowing reason is nothing, nor is freedom. Man is essentially reason; man and child, educated and uneducated, each is reason; or rather, the possibility of being reason is present in each, is given. Still, reason is of no use to the child, to the uneducated. It is only a possibility; and yet, not an empty but a real possibility, with its own orientation to fulfillment. Only the adult, the educated, knows through experience that he is what he is. The difference is simply that in the one case reason is present only as a tendency, only in itself, whereas in the other case it is so explicitly, beyond the form of possibility and posited in existence.

The whole difference in world-history is reducible to this difference. All men are rational, and the formal element in this rationality is human freedom; this is man’s nature, it belongs to his essence. Still, among many peoples slavery has existed, to some extent it still does, and people are satisfied with it. Orientals, for example, are men and as such free, and yet they are not free, because they have no consciousness of their freedom but are willing to accept every sort of religious and political despotism. The whole difference between Oriental peoples and those who are not subject to slavery is that the latter know that they are free, that to be free is proper to them.

The former are also in themselves free, but they do not exist as free. This, then, introduces an enormous difference into man’s world-historical situation, whether he is free merely in himself or whether he knows that it is his concept, his vocation, his nature, to be as a free individual.

This, then, is the second point – simply this difference of existential separateness. In itself the I is free, but it is also free for itself; and I am, only to the extent that I exist as free.

**c.** _Being-for-itself._ The third determination is that what is in itself and what exists and is for itself are one and the same. This is precisely what is meant by development. If the in-itself were no longer the in-itself, then something else would be there, and a complete change would have taken place. In this case there is something and it becomes something else. In regard to development, it is true, we can also speak of change, but the change must be such that the other which results is nevertheless still identical with the first, such that the simple, the in-itself, is not annihilated. It is something concrete, something differentiated, but still maintained in the unity of the original in-itself.

This is what the seed does; it does not change completely but develops. If it changes completely, by being crushed or pulverized, then it cannot develop. This unity of what is present, the existing, and what is in itself is the essential in development. The unity of the differentiated, of the seed and that into which it has developed, is a speculative concept, where they are two and still one. It is a concept of reason; all other determinations in this regard belong simply to understanding. But abstract understanding cannot comprehend this unity; it sticks with the difference and can grasp only abstractions, not the concrete, the concept.

At the same time, development involves mediation; the one is only to the extent to which it is related to the other. What is in itself has the drive to develop, to exist, to pass over into the form of existence; and existence requires the mediation of this sort of tendency. Actually, nothing is immediate. In recent times much noise has been made about immediate knowledge, intuition, etc., but this is only a bad, one-sided abstraction. Philosophy has to do with the real, with concepts. The immediate is simply the unreal. In all that is called immediate knowledge, etc., it is easy to show that mediation is present. As soon as anything is true, it contains in itself mediation; just as mediation, if it is not merely abstract, contains immediacy.

If, in regard to realization, what came first was the in-itself, the seed, etc., and second, existence, i.e., what emerges, then third comes the identity of both, more precisely the fruit of development, the result of the entire movement; and this is what I call, abstractly, _being-for-itself._ It is the being-for-itself of man, of spirit itself, since a plant does not have being-for-itself, if we speak in a language which has reference to consciousness. Only spirit becomes truly for itself, identical with itself.

There we have the concept of development, a thoroughly general concept. It is vitality, movement as such. The life of God in Himself, the life of universality in nature and spirit, the life of whatever lives, the lowest as well as the highest, that is what development is. It is a self-differentiation, a bringing of itself into real being (_Dasein_)_,_ into being-for-another while still remaining identical with itself. It is the eternal creation of the world, which in another form is the generation of the Son, and it is the eternal return of the Spirit into itself – an absolute movement which is at the same time rest, absolute rest – eternal self-mediation. This is the being-with-itself of the idea, the capacity to return into itself, to join with the other and in the other to have itself. This capacity, this power, to be with itself in what is the negative of itself, is also the freedom of man.

#### 3. Development as Concretion

What concerns us here more precisely is the formal. If absolute development, the life of God and of the Spirit, is only _one_ process, only _one_ movement, then it is merely abstract. But universal movement as concrete is a series of manifestations (_Gestaltungen_) of the Spirit. This series should not be pictured as a straight line but as a circle, a return into itself. This circle has as its circumference a large number of circles; _one_ development is always a movement passing through many developments; the totality of this series is a succession of developments curving back on itself; and each particular development is a stage of the whole. Although there is progress in development, it does not go forward into (abstract) infinity but rather turns back into itself.

Spirit must know itself, externalize itself, have itself as object, must know itself in such a way as to exhaust its own possibilities in becoming totally object to itself. It must reveal itself completely, going down into its uttermost depths and revealing those depths. The higher spirit’s development is, the deeper it is; in this way it is really deep, not just in itself; in itself it is neither deep nor high. Development is precisely a self-deepening of spirit, such that it brings its own depths to consciousness. The goal of spirit is, if we may employ the expression, to comprehend itself, to remain no longer hidden to itself. The road to this is its development, and the series of developments form the levels of its development.

Now, to the extent that something is the result of a level in a development it is once again the starting-point of a new and further development. The end of one level is always the beginning of another. Goethe, therefore, is correct when he says somewhere, “What has been formed becomes ever again matter.

The levels are distinct; each subsequent level is more concrete than the preceding; and the lowest is the most abstract. Thus, in regard to spirit, children are the most abstract; they are rich in sensible intuitions but poor in thoughts. At the beginning of a lecture we usually have much sensible material, which is poorest in regard to thoughts. Our first thoughts are more abstract determinations of our thinking than are later ones. Thus, we first come up against the notion of thing. There is no thing; it is only a thought; and so in the beginning only such abstract determinations of our thinking emerge. The abstract is simple and easy. Subsequent stages are more concrete. They presuppose the determinations proper to previous stages, and they develop them further. Each subsequent stage of the development, then, is richer, augmented by these determinations and, thereby, more concrete. There is, then, no thought which does not progress in its development.

These are the notions (_Bestimmungen_) I wanted to present by way of preface to my remarks. I have not proved them, only given an ordered enumeration of them, seeking to make them plausible to those who follow our way of thinking.

Now we have to make an application of these notions and see their concrete consequences. For that reason I have proposed them. We now turn to what is more precise, more determinate, in the matter of history, i.e., of the history of philosophy.

### II. Application of these Notions (_Bestimmungen_) to the History of Philosophy

1. **a.** In accord with these notions _philosophy is_ thought brought to consciousness, occupied with itself, made into its own object, thinking itself, and that in terms of the various notions proper to it. Thus, the science of philosophy is a development of free thought, or rather, it is the whole of this development; it is a circle which returns into itself, remains entirely with itself, is entirely itself, and wants to return only to itself. When we are occupied with the sensible we are not with ourselves but with something other. It is different when we are occupied with thought; thought is with itself only. Philosophy, then, is the development of thought, undisturbed in its activity. Thus, philosophy is a system. In recent times, system has become a term of reproach, because from it one gets the impression that it clings to a one-sided principle. The proper meaning of system, however, is totality, and it is true only as such a totality, whose point of departure is the most simple but which makes itself ever more concrete through development.

**b.** Now, the _history of philosophy is_ precisely that and nothing else. In philosophy as such, in the present, most recent philosophy, is contained all that the work of millennia has produced; it is the result of all that has preceded it. And the same development of Spirit, looked at historically, is the history of philosophy. It is the history of all the developments which Spirit has undergone, a presentation of its moments or stages as they follow one another in time. Philosophy presents the development of thought as it is in and for itself, without addition; the history of philosophy is this development in time. Consequently the history of philosophy is identical with the system of philosophy. Admittedly, this identity is at this point simply asserted; the proper speculative proof cannot here be given. The proof involves the nature of reason, of thinking, and this is to be taken up in the science of philosophy itself. The history of philosophy provides the empirical proof. Such a history’s task is to show that its own process is the systematizing of thought itself. In it will be presented what is presented in philosophy, simply with the addition of time, of the incidental historical circumstances connected with countries, various individuals, etc. _When_ in time philosophy appears is a matter we shall consider in the second part of the Introduction.

Spirit in and for itself is quite completely, through and through, concrete. Since it is active, not only does its form consist in its becoming conscious of itself in pure thought, but it emerges in the totality of what belongs to its manifestation. (_Gestaltung_)_,_ a world-historical manifestation. When Spirit progresses it must progress in its totality, and, since its progress takes place in time; its total development, too, takes place in time. The thought which is fundamental to a given time is the all-pervading spirit. This latter must progress in consciousness of itself, and such a progress is the development of the whole mass (_Masse_)_,_ of the concrete totality, which is externalized and, therefore, takes place in time.

Since the history of philosophy has to do with pure thought it is itself a science, i.e., not an accumulation of knowledge ordered in a certain manner but a thought-development which in and for itself is necessary. It must, however, take into account the necessity that the emergence of thought take place in time. This, after all, is a course in history, and we must proceed historically, i.e., we must take up these manifestations (_Gestaltungen_) _in_ their temporal succession, whereby they give the impression, in the manner in which they appear, of being contingent and unconnected. In so doing, however, we must emphasize the necessity inherent in the process of philosophy.

This is the sense, the meaning, of the history of philosophy. Philosophy develops through its history, and vice versa. Philosophy and history of philosophy mirror each other. To study the history of philosophy is to study philosophy itself, and this principally as a logic. We shall speak further on of the concrete. In order to interpret the history of philosophy in this way, one must, it is true, previously know what philosophy is and what its history is. Still, one must not take an a priori view of the history of philosophy based on the principles of one philosophy. Purely historically, thought shows the way it progresses for itself.

**c.** More precisely, then, how does the development of philosophy make its appearance in time? We said, with regard to thought, that there is no asking what its meaning is, since it is its own meaning; there is nothing hidden behind it – not, however, in the ordinary sense of that expression, for thought itself is the ultimate, the deepest, behind which there is nothing further; it is entirely itself. Still, thought also has an appearance, and to the extent that one distinguishes the appearance from the thought, it is possible to speak of thought’s meaning. One of the ways thought appears; after all, is in one’s own idea of it; another is the historical.

The first appearance of thought is such that thinking, or thought, appears as something particular. In addition to the fact that we think, that there are thoughts, there are sense-perceptions, drives, inclinations, determinations of the will, etc. We have, thus, other faculties or activities of the soul which possess a right equal to that of thinking. In this way, then, thought is there as a particular among particulars. In philosophy, however, an entirely different notion (Vorstellung) of thinking and of thought must be formed. Thinking is the activity of the universal. Insofar as in addition there are other activities, of course, this activity is particular. It is its true nature, however, to subsume under itself all the others. Thus, it is through thinking that man is distinguished from the beast. Feelings, drives, etc., are common to man and beast. Still, special types of feeling, such as religious, legal,’ or moral feelings, are proper to man alone. In themselves feelings are as such in no way either worthwhile or true. What is true in them – e.g., that a feeling is religious – derives only from thinking. The beast has no religion, but it does have feelings. Moreover, man has religion only because he is a thinking being. Thinking is the simply universal, and concrete thinking has in itself its own particularization, which is to say that in thought the particular is not equivalent to the abstract.

Connected with this last, another way that thinking appears is as subjective. Thought is proper to man alone – not, however, to man only as an isolated individual subject; we have to look at thought as essentially objective. Thought is simply the universal; even in nature, with its class-concepts and its laws, we recognize the presence of thoughts. They are, then, not only in the form that consciousness gives them but in and for themselves and, by that very fact, objectively. The world’s reason is not subjective reason. Thought is the substantial, the true, as compared with the singular, which is momentary, passing, temporary. To know the nature of thought is to eliminate the subjective manner in which it appears. This means, then, that it is not merely something particular, subjective, belonging only to our own consciousness, but rather the universal, the objective in and for itself.

A second appearance of thought is, as we have already mentioned, the historical, according to which the determinations of thought have emerged at a particular time, in a particular place, to a particular individual , with the result that the sequence in which thought is manifested seems accidental. We have already spoken of how such an impression is supported. We take up thoughts historically, in the way they have made their appearance in this or that individual, etc. Here there is a temporal development, but one which follows the inner necessity of the concept.

The only worthwhile way of looking at the history of philosophy, what makes it truly interesting, is seeing that it shows there is rationality in the world, even from this point of view. There is a strong antecedent presumption that this is so; the history of philosophy is the development of thinking reason; hence its growth can be presumed to have been rational. The temple of reason in its consciousness of itself is loftier than Solomon’s temple and others built by man. The building of it has been rational – not like the way the Jews or the Freemasons go about building Solomon’s temple.

One can bring with him to the enterprise the belief that the building process has been rational. This is a belief in providence – in a somewhat different way. What is best in the world is what thought has produced. It makes no sense, then, to see reason only in nature and not in spirit, in history, etc. If on the one hand we are of the opinion that providence governs the world and, on the other, hold that world-events in the realm of spirit – which is what philosophies are – are accidental, the second view (_Vorstellung_) contradicts the first. To put it more forcibly: the belief in providence is not serious; it is mere empty chatter. What has happened, however, has happened, because providence with its thoughts has been in charge.

2. **a.** The first conclusion we can draw from the foregoing is that in the history of philosophy we are _not dealing with opinions._ In everyday life, of course, we have to do with opinions, i.e., thoughts about external things; one has one opinion, another has another. But in the business of the world’s Spirit there is a completely different seriousness; it is there that universality is. There it is a question of the universal determination of the Spirit, nor do we speak of this or that one’s opinion. The universal Spirit develops in itself according to its own necessity; its opinion is simply the truth.

**b.** The second conclusion is the answer to the question: _What is the situation in regard to diverse philosophies,_ about which we hear it said that they are a proof against _philosophy_ itself, i.e., against truth? First of all we must say, there is only _one_ philosophy. Now this, of course, has a formal sense, since each philosophy is at least philosophy to the extent that it really is philosophy – frequently what is called philosophy is simply chatter, arbitrary caprice, etc). just as different kinds of fruit are all fruit, so are we to look. upon the relation of various philosophies to the one philosophy. A more precise sense in which we can speak of many philosophies is to say that they are the necessary stages in the development of reason coming to consciousness of itself, a reason which is one in the way we previously understood it. The manner in which they succeed each other, then, is necessary. No philosophy, therefore, can make its appearance sooner than it does. It is true, of course, that in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ancient philosophies were resurrected – this was necessary to the progress of Christian culture. Nevertheless, when past philosophies return again they are like mummies of earlier thoughts. The World-Spirit has progressed, and a past philosophy is not its proper garment, the form in which it finds expressed what it in fact is.

With regard to the refutation of one philosophy by another, a more precise characterization (_Bestimmung_) _is_ required, one which will be made manifest in the history of philosophy itself, one which shows in what relation philosophies stand to each other and to what extent the position (_Stellung_) of their principle has changed. Refutation, as we have seen, involves a negation, namely that what had been believed regarding a system of philosophy no longer holds. Now, such a negation is of two types. In one form, when some philosophy or another is compared with an earlier one and the principle of the later one is affirmed, then the subsequent system shows the untenability of the earlier. In itself every principle of the understanding is one-sided , and such a one-sidedness is brought out by the fact that another principle is contrasted with it. This other principle, however is equally one-sided. In this situation there is present no totality as the unity in which they are reconciled; it exists only as completeness in the process of development. In this way, for example, Epicureanism stands in opposition to Stoicism, or the Spinozistic substance of absolute unity is opposed to that of the Leibnizian monad, in its concrete individuality. Thus, the self-developing Spirit integrates the one-sidedness of the one principle by making the other appear. The second, more profound form of negation consists in the unification of diverse philosophies into one whole in such a way that no one of them remains independent, but all appear as parts of the one. Their principles are united by being reduced to elements of the one idea; or they consist merely in moments, determinations, aspects of the one idea. This, then, is the concrete which unites the others in itself and constitutes the true unity of these diverse forms.

The concrete of which we speak is to be distinguished from the eclectic procedure, i.e., from a mere combining of diverse principles and opinions, like combining different pieces of cloth in one garment. The concrete is the absolute and complete identity of those differences, not an external combining of them – just as the human soul is the concrete in relation to souls in general, since the vegetable soul is contained in the animal and the latter in the human. Convergences (_Knoten_) such as these, where certain particularities, certain philosophies, are united in one, we shall become acquainted with in the history of philosophy. One such, for example, is the Platonic philosophy. If we pick up Plato’s dialogues we find that some are Eleatic, others Pythagorean, and still others Heraclitean in character; yet Plato’s philosophy has united in itself these earlier philosophies and in so doing has transformed their inadequacies. This is no eclectic philosophy but rather an absolute, true penetration into the unification of these philosophies. Another example is Alexandrian philosophy, which has also been called Neoplatonic, Neopythagorean, and Neoaristotelian – it unified in itself precisely these opposites.

**c.** A third conclusion to be drawn from what has been said up to this point is that we are _not dealing with what is past_ but rather with actual thinking, with our own spirit. Properly speaking, then, this is not a history, since the thoughts, the principles, the ideas with which we are concerned belong to the present; they are ‘determinations within our own spirit. The historical, i.e., the past as such, is no longer, it is dead. The tendency to be abstractly historical, to be occupied with lifeless objects, has in recent times gained ground.

But the heart must be dead which finds satisfaction with dead bodies. The spirit of truth and life lives only in what is. The living spirit speaks: “Let the dead bury their dead;. follow me!” If I know thoughts, truths, cognitions, only, historically, they remain outside my spirit, i.e., for me they are dead; neither my thinking nor my spirit is present in them; what is most interior to me, my thought, is absent. The possession of merely historical knowledge is like the legal ownership of things which I do not know what to do, with. If we simply stop at the knowledge of what this or that philosophy has thought, of what has been handed down (_uberliefert_)_,_ then we surrender (_uberliefert_) ourselves, and we forgo what makes man to be man, we forgo thinking. We are, thus, occupied merely with the thinking and the spirit of others, we investigate only what has been truth for others. Now, we must think for ourselves. If our interest in theology is merely historical – if, for example, we learn only what Church councils, or heretics and non-heretics, have known about God’s nature – we can, of course, have had edifying thoughts, but we do not have the spirit properly speaking. To have this there is no need of theological erudition. When the historical tendency has taken over a given age, it can be taken for granted that the spirit has fallen into despair, has died, has given up the attempt to satisfy itself – otherwise it would not be concerned with the sort of objects which for it are dead.

In the authentic history (_Geschichte_) of thought it is thought with which we are concerned; there we have to consider how the spirit enters into its own depths in order to arrive at consciousness of itself, as man renders to himself an account of his spirit’s consciousness. In order to do this, man must be present to _his own spirit._ Here, however, I speak only against the merely historical (_geschichtliche_) attitude. In no way should this make the study of history as such something to be despised. We ourselves, in fact, want to take up the _history of_ philosophy. Still, when an age treats _everything_ historically (_historisch_), thus being constantly occupied solely with the world which no longer is and so wanders around in mausoleums, then has the spirit given up its own life which consists in its thinking itself.

Connected with the purely historical (_historischen_) manner of treating philosophy is the demand that one who teaches the history _of_ philosophy be uninvolved (_unparteiisch_)_._ This _insistence on non-involvement_ means for the most part simply that the one who teaches history of philosophy shall act like a dead man in presenting philosophies, that he should treat them as something separated from his own spirit, something external, that he should himself be without thought in treating them. Tennemann, for example, conveys this impression of non-involvement. If we look at him more closely, however, we find him completely caught up in the Kantian philosophy, whose main contention is that the true is not to be known. In that case, however, the history of philosophy is a sorry affair, where one knows ahead of time that one must put up with unsuccessful efforts. Tennemann praises the most diverse philosophers for their erudition, their genius, etc., but he finds fault with them for not having adopted the Kantian point of view or, simply, for having philosophized. One should not, if one follows this view, be on the side of thinking spirit. Still, if one wants to study the history of philosophy properly, then non-involvement consists in not opting for the opinions, thoughts, concepts of individuals. But, one must be involved in philosophy and not be satisfied with limiting oneself merely to the knowledge of what others have thought.

Truth will be known (_erkannt_) only when with his spirit one is in it; mere knowledge about (_Kenntnis_) it does not show that one is in it.

To all this I should like to add a few remarks regarding the manner of treating the history of philosophy.

### III. Consequences in Regard to Treating the History of Philosophy

It is obvious before we start that one semester is too short a time in which to come quite thoroughly to terms with the history of philosophy, a work of the Spirit which spans millennia. The field, therefore, has to be narrowed. From what we have already said concerning the kind of history we want to speak about, there are, in regard to its extension, two conclusions to be drawn.

1. We limit ourselves to principles and to their development in the various philosophies. This will be particularly true when we are treating of the earlier philosophies, not so much because of the lack of time, but rather because in them only principles can be of interest to us. They are the most abstract, simplest, and consequently also the most indeterminate principles – i.e., wherein determinateness has not yet been posited, even though in them all determinations are contained. To a certain extent these abstract principles are adequate; they go far enough to be of interest to us. Because, however, their development is not yet complete, qualitatively they are particular, i.e., in their application they extend only to a delimited sphere. Such, for example, is the principle of mechanism. Were we to consider what Descartes has to say about animal nature on the basis of this principle we should not be satisfied. Our own more profound concept demands for this a more concrete principle; it would not be enough for us to use this principle in explaining plant or animal nature. There is a sphere of reality suited to an abstract principle; thus the principle of mechanism is valid for inorganic nature, which belongs to the sphere of abstract existence. (The living is the concrete, the inorganic the abstract.) For a higher sphere, however, the principle of mechanism is inadequate. To give another example, the ancient abstract philosophies looked at the universe from the standpoint of the atomistic principle. Such a principle is totally inadequate, when there is question of life, of spirit. A consideration, therefore, of its relationship to life or to spirit is of no interest to us. From this point of view, then, it is philosophical interest which determines us to consider here only the principles of these philosophies.

2. In regard to older philosophers, then, we must confine ourselves exclusively to the philosophical, leaving out the historical, biographical, critical, etc. – thus disregarding what has been written about them, what is only peripheral to them. In this connection all sorts of extrinsic considerations have been injected, e.g., that Thales was the first to predict an eclipse of the sun, that Descartes and Leibniz were skilled in mathematical analysis, etc. All such considerations we eliminate.

By the same token the historical account of the way systems were disseminated can be of little concern to us here. We treat simply the content of philosophical systems, not their extrinsic history. We know, for example, a host of Stoic teachers who had a great influence in their own times and even developed this or that detail. We abstract from such details and pass over these men. To the extent that they were famous only as teachers, the history of philosophy is silent about them.

The second point to be taken up in the Introduction is the relationship of philosophy to other manifestations of spirit, the relation of its history to other histories.

## B. RELATION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY TO THE REST OF SPIRIT’s MANIFESTATIONS

As we know, the history of philosophy is not independent (_fur_ sich) but is connected with history in general, with external history as well as with the history of religion, etc. It is natural, then, that we should recall the principal. moments of political history, the character of the time and the overall situation of the people, wherein philosophy comes info being. In addition, however, the connection with general history is internal, i.e., essential and necessary, not merely external; nor is it merely a question of one being simultaneous with the other (simultaneity is no relationship at all).

There are, then, two aspects we must take into consideration: first, the properly historical aspect of the relationship, and, secondly, the factual connection, i.e., the connection of philosophy itself with religion and with the other sciences which are related to it. These two aspects are to be looked at more in detail, in order to distinguish more precisely the concept which characterizes philosophy.

### I. The Historical Status of Philosophy

1. With regard to the historical status of philosophy the first thing to be taken into account is the general relationship which the philosophy of an era has with the rest of the manifestations which characterize the same era.

It is customarily said that the political situation, religion, mythology, etc., are to be taken account of in the history of philosophy, because they have greatly influenced the philosophy of an era, and, in its turn, philosophy has had a great influence on them. If, however, one is to be content with categories such as “great influence,” the effect of one on the other, etc., all one has to do is to show an external connection, i.e., the point of view implies that each is for itself, one independent of the other. Here, however, we must take an entirely different view of this relationship: the essential category is unity, the inner connection of these diverse manifestations. We must be convinced that there is _only one_ spirit, _one_ principle which manifests itself just as much in the political situation as in religion, art, morality, social relations, commerce, and industry – in such a way that these diverse forms are but branches of one main trunk. This is the main point of view. The spirit is only one, it is the one substantial spirit of one period, one people, one era, but a spirit which takes multiple forms; and these diverse forms are the moments which are to be brought out. It is not to be imagined that politics, civil constitutions, religions, etc., constitute the root or the cause of philosophy, nor that conversely the latter is the foundation of the former. In all of these moments there is one character, which is the foundation of all and penetrates all. No matter how diverse the different aspects are, there is nothing contradictory in this. No one of them contains anything heterogeneous to the foundation, however much they may seem to be mutually contradictory. They are simply shoots coming from the same root; and philosophy is one of them.

2. Philosophy, then, is one aspect of the total manifestation of spirit – consciousness of spirit being its supreme flowering, since its effort is to know what spirit is. It is, in fact, the dignity of man to know what he is and to know this in the purest manner, i.e., to attain to the thinking of what he is. The result of this is a revelation of the place which philosophy holds among the other manifestations of spirit.

**a.** Philosophy is identical with the spirit of the era in which it makes its appearance; it is not superior to its era but simply the consciousness of what is substantial in it, or, it is thinking knowledge of what belongs to that era. By the same token an individual is not superior to his era; he is its son; what is substantial in it is his essence, he simply manifests it in a particular form. No one can escape from what is substantial in his era – any more than he can get out of his own skin. Thus, from the substantial point of view, philosophy cannot leap beyond its own times.

**b.** Nevertheless, philosophy does stand over and above its own era, which is to say, from the point of view of form, since it consists in the thinking of what is substantial in that era. To the extent that it knows the substantial, i.e., makes it an object over against itself, it has the same content but as a knowledge of it goes beyond. The difference, however, is simply formal; there is no difference in content.

**c.** Now, this very knowledge is the actuality (_Wirklichkeit_) of spirit – I am only to the extent that I know myself. It is the spirit’s self-knowledge which formerly was not present. Thus, the formal difference is also a real, actual one. This knowledge it is, then, which produces a new form in the development of spirit. In this context developments are simply ways of knowing. By self-knowledge spirit posits itself as distinct from what it is; it posits itself for itself [as independent], develops in itself. This involves a new difference between what it is in itself and what its actuality is; and, thus, a new manifestation emerges. In itself, then, philosophy is already a further determinateness or character of spirit; it is the interior birthplace of the spirit which is later to appear in actuality. Its concretion emerges in the history of philosophy itself. In this connection we shall see that what Greek philosophy was came to actuality in the Christian world.

Here, then, is the second determination, i.e., that philosophy is first and foremost simply the thinking of what is substantial in its own time, that it does not stand above that time but only brings out its content.

3. The third thing to be taken into account with regard to its historical situation has to do with the time when philosophy emerges, in comparison with other manifestations of spirit.

The spirit of an era is its substantial life; it is the spirit as immediately vital, actual. Thus, at a time when Greek life flourishes, we see the Greek spirit in the freshness and strength of its youth, unaffected by decadence. The Roman spirit we see during the era of the republic. And so it goes.

The spirit of the era is also the way a particular spirit is present as actual vitality. Philosophy, however, is this spirit’s thinking; and thought, no matter how a priori it may be, is essentially the result of spirit, for spirit is the vital activity which produces itself; in its progress it produces itself as a result. This movement contains a negation as an essential moment. If something is to be produced, then it must be produced from something else, and precisely that other is negated in the movement. Thus, thinking negates the natural way of living. The child, for example, exists as a human being, but still immediately, naturally; education, then, is the negation of this natural way, it is the discipline which spirit imposes on itself in order to raise itself from its immediacy. By the same token, thinking spirit as it begins its movement is in its natural form. Then, as it be comes reflective it goes beyond its natural form, i.e., it negates it; ultimately it realizes itself by grasping itself in concept. This is where thinking enters. The consequence of this is that the spirit with its realistic norms based on custom (_Sittlichkeit_)_, which_ constitute its vital force, is negated. This means that thought, which is the spirit’s substantial manner of existing, attacks and weakens simple custom, simple religion, etc., thus ushering in a period of decadence. Then, with further progress, thought recollects itself, becomes concrete, and in this way produces for itself an ideal world in contrast to the former real one. So, when philosophy is to make its appearance among a people, a rupture must have occurred in the actual world. Then philosophy remedies the decadence which thought had begun. The remedial action takes place in the ideal world, the world of spirit where man takes refuge when the earthly world satisfies him no longer. Philosophy begins with the decline of a real world. When it appears and – painting gray on gray – spreads its abstractions, then is the fresh color and vitality of youth gone. What it produces, then, is a remedy, but only in the world of thought, not in the earthly world. Thus the Greeks, when they began to think, withdrew from the state; and they began to think at a time when in the world around them there was nothing but turbulence and wretchedness, e.g., during the time of the Peloponnesian War. That was when the philosophers withdrew into their thought-world; as the people said of them, they became idlers. So it has been with almost all peoples; philosophy makes its first appearance when public life is no longer satisfying and ceases to hold the interest of the people, and the citizen finds it so difficult to take any part in government.

All this is an essential determination of philosophy, which the history of philosophy preserves. As the Ionic cities declined, Ionic philosophy blossomed. The external world no longer satisfied the spirit. In the same way among the Romans, philosophizing began with the fall of the republic, when demagogues took over the government, and everything was caught up in a dissolution of the old and a striving toward the new. It was not until the decline of the Roman Empire, which although so great, so rich, and so imposing, was internally already dead, that the earlier Greek philosophies experienced their highest cultivation in the work of the Neoplatonists or Alexandrians. In similar fashion with the decline of the Middle Ages we see the revival of older philosophies.

This brings us to the more precise connection between philosophy and the other forms of spirit’s existence.

### II. More Precise Characterization of the Relationship between Philosophy and the Other Manifestations of Spirit

Our second point concerns the more precise and determinate connection between philosophy and other manifestations of spirit. We are confronted with sciences, art, mythology, religion, politics, etc., whose general connection with philosophy has already been treated. Now we want to look at the difference between philosophy and these other manifestations. We do this by delimiting the concept of philosophy, selecting out the moments which thus become important, and applying them to our own subject matter which is the history of philosophy. In so doing our purpose is to separate off and exclude what does not belong to the subject. It is easy enough to say that in the history of philosophy only philosophy itself, in the process peculiar to it, is to be considered, and that everything else, such as religion, etc., is to be left to the side. In general that is quite correct. Still we ask: what is philosophy? Much is put under that heading which we must exclude. If we are to look only at the name we should have to include much that has nothing to do with the concept of philosophy. As for religion, we can also say in general that we have to leave it to one side. In history, however, religion and philosophy have frequently been both connected with each other and in conflict with each other – in the Greek as well as in the Christian era – and their opposition constitutes a very definite moment in the history of philosophy. Properly speaking, then, philosophy only seems to leave religion aside. Historically speaking neither has allowed the other to go untouched; nor must we do so either.

In our investigation we want to look first at the sciences, or at scientific culture as such. After that we must look at religion and particularly at the more precise relationship between philosophy and religion. This relationship must be looked at openly, directly, and honestly; one must not give the impression of wanting to leave religion untouched. To give this impression is to attempt simply to hide the fact that philosophy has been opposed to religion. Religion – which is to say the theologians – pretends to ignore philosophy, in order not to be troubled in its own arbitrary reasonings.

#### 1. Relation of Philosophy to Scientific Culture as Such

We begin, then, with scientific culture as such; more precisely with the empirical sciences, which are based on observation, experiment, and reasoning. We must look at them, of course, bearing in mind that this sort of thing has also been called philosophizing. What they have in common with philosophy, after all, is thinking. They belong within the framework of experience, but they are also characterized by thinking, since they strive to discover the universal in experience. Scientific culture, then, shares its formal aspect with philosophy. Religion, on the other hand, shares with philosophy its other aspect, the substantial, which is to say God, the Spirit, the Absolute. To know the essence of this world, of truth, of the absolute Idea, is common ground for both philosophy and religion.

With regard to the matter proper to scientific culture, on the one hand principles have been established as to what is to be done; this involves practical requirements (_Gebote, Pflichten_)_._ On the other hand we recognize laws, forces, natural classes,’ causes. Matter, then, corresponds to what in the external world are forces and causes and to what in the spiritual world of morality is the substantial, the motivating, the enduring. A content such as this demands, as does philosophy, thinking; and whatever has been thought from this point of view has been called philosophy. Thus, in the history of philosophy what we first meet are the seven wise men of Greece. They, too, are called philosophers, principally because they enunciated a number of moral sayings and principles concerning general moral obligations and essential relationships. Then, in more recent times we see that man began to turn his gaze to things of nature. That was the case particularly in the period subsequent to that of scholastic philosophy. A _priori_ reasoning about the things of nature based on religion or metaphysics was given up, and nature itself was investigated; it was observed, and an attempt was made to know its laws and forces. By the same token research was instituted into moral relationships, civil law, etc. – and this was also called philosophy. It was customary, for example, to speak of Newtonian philosophy, even though it concerned itself principally only with things of nature. In general, then, the form which characterizes philosophy is one according to which, from experience regarding nature, the state, justice, religion, etc., general principles are derived and are enunciated as formal, quite universal principles.

Philosophy, it is said, investigates universal causes, the ultimate grounds of things. Thus, wherever in the sciences universal causes, essential grounds, and principles are enunciated, the sciences have this universality in common with philosophy, and, to be more precise, such principles and grounds are derived from experience and from reflection on it (_innere Empfindung_). No matter how foreign to the principle of philosophy this last may seem to be, it is nevertheless true with regard to any philosophy that I have received it through my senses and through reflection on what they present to me (_meine innere Empfindung_) – i.e., through experience – and that on the basis of this experience alone I consider it true. This form of knowing, of taking into oneself, has appeared not only in opposition to religion but also in a negative relation to other philosophies; and this, too, was called philosophy, because it was opposed to whatever is merely positive. Newtonian philosophy comprises only what we now call philosophy of nature – a science based on experience and perception, containing knowledge of laws, forces, and universal properties of nature.

It was a great period in history which saw the emergence of this principle of experience, when man began to see for himself, to feel, to taste, to look on nature as worthwhile, to rely significantly on the testimony of his senses, to hold for true only what was known through the senses. This conviction of the immediate certitude afforded by the senses was the foundation for this so-called philosophy; it was from this testimony of the senses, after all, that the sciences of nature took their impetus. This reliance on the senses was opposed to previous ways of looking at nature; formerly the point of departure had been metaphysical principles. Because men now based their procedures on sensible representations they came into conflict with religion and the state. It was, however, not merely the testimony of the senses which they had set up against a metaphysics of the understanding; still another testimony was highly regarded – namely, that the true could count as true only to the extent that it was to be found in both the heart and the understanding of man. Through this kind of understanding, this thinking and feeling for himself, there resulted an even greater opposition to what was merely positive in religion and contemporary government. Man learned now to do his own observing and thinking, to form his own representations, opposing them to the fixed truths and dogmas of the Church and to then – accepted civil law – or at least he sought new principles to support the old civil law, in order to justify it in the light of these principles. In the precise context in which religion is positive had been found the validation of those principles according to which subjects owed obedience to the authority of the princes; it was the divine authority which gave validity to these principles, because rulers were appointed by God. The basis for this was found in the Jewish laws according to which kings were the anointed of the Lord. (The Mosaic laws had a special validity even with regard to marriage.) Against this whole positive position, against whatever had been imposed by authority, man’s own proper understanding and free thinking rebelled. Among those who thought this way can be counted Hugo Grotius who formulated a law of nations based on what was accepted as law by all peoples, i.e., the consensus gentium. According to this law the purpose of the state was posited as something proper to the state itself, as something immanent in man, rather than based on a divine command. What was accepted as law was derived from what is the ground for man’s being recognized as man, whereas previously everything had been regulated by authoritarian legislation (_nach dem Positiven_). Positing in this way a ground other than that of authority was called philosophizing, and for this reason philosophy was also called world-wisdom. Because this kind of philosophizing had as its object external nature and the rights of human nature, and because a content such as this owed its origin to the activity of man’s mundane understanding and reason, it was correct to call this world-wisdom. There is no question that philosophy does not limit itself to internal objects; it extends its interest to everything in the surrounding world and, thus, is occupied with mundane, finite things. On the other hand, however, it does not confine itself to the mundane; it has the same goal as religion; and the mundane which it has as its object is nonetheless a determinateness of the divine Idea. In recent times Schlegel has warmed over again the term world-wisdom as a name for philosophy. He intended it, however, ironically; what he meant was that philosophy must give way, when there is question of higher things – for example, of religion. In this he has had a number of followers.

In England under the heading of philosophy is understood natural science. Thus it happens that a journal (like _Hermbstadts Journal_), for example, which talks about agriculture (manure), economics, industry, chemistry, etc., and tells about discoveries in these areas, is called a philosophical review. By the same token optical instruments, barometers, thermometers, etc., are called philosophical instruments. Even theories, especially those concerned with morality, which are derived more from the feelings of the human heart and from experience than from the concept or from determinations of what is right, in England belong to philosophy. The Scottish moral philosophers in particular should be mentioned in this connection; they reason in a Ciceronian manner, taking as their starting point drives, inclinations, and immediate certainty, i.e., from the sort of thing which Cicero calls _insitum natura._ In the same way modern English theories of political economy, e.g., that of Adam Smith and of those influenced by him, are counted as philosophy. The result is that, at least in England, the name philosophy is respected, because there whatever is derived from general principles or can be taken out of the realm of experience and brought back to determinate principles is called philosophical. A short time ago a banquet was held in honor of Canning. In his speech of acknowledgment it comes out that he congratulates England, because there philosophical principles are employed in government. Thus, in England at least, philosophy is not a term used ironically.

Now, even though all these ways of viewing things go under the heading of philosophy, we must exclude them from our treatment of the subject, despite the fact that in all of them there is a principle which they have in common with philosophy, i.e., that in them it is one’s self which sees, senses, thinks, is present. Whatever the area may be, this is the great principle opposed to authority. In perception it is 1 myself who perceive; and the same is true of sensing, understanding, thinking. What is to have significance for man must be contained in his own thinking. Properly speaking, “in his own thinking” is a pleonasm; every man must think for himself, no one can think for another, any more than he can eat or drink for another. It is this moment of the self, plus the form which is produced in thinking, the form of universal laws, principles, fundamental determinations, in short the form of universality, that philosophy has in common with those sciences, philosophical points of view, representations, etc., of which we have been speaking; they are what has given to all of them the name philosophy.

#### 2. Relation of Philosophy to Religion

The second sphere of those manifestations of spirit which are more closely related to philosophy is the area of religious representations in general. Here belongs primarily religion as such, then mythology and the mysteries, and even to a certain extent poetry. just as the first area of which we spoke had in common with philosophy its formal element, the I and the form of universality, so what is common here is the other side, i.e., the substantial element, the content.

In the various religions, peoples have left a record of the way they thought regarding the being of the world, the absolute, that which is in and for itself. There we find what they held to be the cause, the essence, the substantial, in both nature and spirit. There, too, we discover their opinions regarding the manner in which human spirit or human nature is related to such objects – to the divinity, the true.

In religion, then, we immediately observe two characteristics (_Bestimmungen_)_:_ first, how man is conscious of God, i.e., how in consciousness he represents God, this being the objective form or determination of thought whereby man sets the essence of divinity over against himself, represents it as something other than himself, as an alien being in the beyond. The second characteristic is to be found in devotion and cult, which constitute the overcoming of this opposition, whereby. man raises himself to God and becomes conscious of his unity with God’s being. This is the sense which cult has in all religions. Among the Greeks cult served rather to raise them to an enjoyment of this unity, since for them the being of God was not in itself something beyond them.

Religion and philosophy, then, have as an object in common what is true in and for itself – God, insofar as He is in and for Himself – and man in his relation to God. In religions, men have made manifest the consciousness they had concerning the supreme being. To this extent religions are the supreme work of reason. Thus it is absurd to believe that priests invented religion in order to deceive the people – as though men would permit anything to be imposed on them with regard to the ultimate and supreme being.

Although philosophy has the same object as religion, still in relation to each other they have developed many differences. The first question, then, is: how does philosophy differ from theology and religion in general? The second is: to what extent must we in the history of philosophy take the religious into account?

**a.** _The Form of Philosophy Distinguished from That of Religion._ First, then, the question how philosophy and religion differ from each other. In this connection I intend to present their general characteristics and – so far as possible – discuss them.

**b.** _Divine and Human Spirit._ Common to both is what is in and for itself, the universal, absolute Spirit. This is spirit, but at the same time it includes nature within itself; it is itself and the grasp of nature within itself. It is not identical with nature in the superficial sense in which the chemically neutral is, but is rather in its own self identical with – nature, or one with itself in nature. Such is its identity with nature that the latter, its negative, the real, is posited only as ideal. That is the idealism of spirit. The universality of spirit, to which both philosophy and religion are related, is absolute, not exterior, universality. It is a universality which penetrates everything, is present in everything. We have to represent spirit to ourselves as free, and freedom of the spirit means that it is with itself, has a rational awareness of itself. Its nature is to grasp the other in such a comprehensive way as to find itself in the other, to unite itself with itself in the other, there to possess and enjoy itself.

Here, then, is manifested the relationship of Spirit to the human spirit. No matter how fragile and isolated individuality may be represented, abstraction must simply be made from this sort of atomistic representation. When spirit is represented in truth it is what is rationally aware of itself (_das sich selbst Vernehmende_)_._ The difference between the individual and the universal, then, is so to be expressed, that the subjective, individual spirit is the universal divine Spirit, to the extent that there is rational awareness of the latter, to the extent that the latter manifests itself in each subject, each man. The spirit which is rationally aware of absolute Spirit is, then, the subjective spirit.

If we take this determination as our point of departure, then as further determinations we have simply various forms of this rational awareness. What we call religious _belief is_ the substantial, universal manner in which man is rationally aware of the divine Spirit. Apart from belief the divine Spirit is not what he is according to the teaching of the Church. In this way the divine Spirit is not in himself but is present in the spirit of man, in the spirit of those who belong to his community. Then it is that the individual spirit is rationally aware of the divine Spirit, i.e., of the essence of _his_ own spirit, of _his own essence,_ of what is substantial in him; and this essence is precisely the universal in and for itself, the enduring. That is the faith of the Evangelical Church – not an historical (_historischer_) faith, not a belief in historical (_geschichtliche_) things; rather this Lutheran faith is the spirit’s own faith, the consciousness whereby it is rationally aware of the substantial in spirit. According to a recent theory of faith it is said: I believe, I have immediate knowledge that I have a body. This, then, is called belief, that something determinate, some content or other is immediately in us, is produced in our consciousness. That is belief in the external sense. But the internal, the religious sense of belief is precisely the knowledge of the absolute Spirit of which we have been speaking; and this knowledge, as it is first of all in the human spirit, is immediate and, as a result, is immediate certitude. It is simply a testimony of man’s spirit, which is the profound root of the identity of spirit in general. Spirit generates (_erzeugt_) itself, manifests its own self, shows itself and gives testimony of itself also, of its unity with itself. It also has consciousness of itself, consciousness of its unity with its object, because it is itself its own object. Now, when consciousness of this object comes on the scene, develops, and takes form, the content in question can seem to be something given in sensation, sensibly represented, coming from outside; the way in mythology a myth has of coming into being according to an historical pattern. This pattern is external. To faith, however, belongs the testimony of the spirit. The content can, of course, come from outside, be given and received, but the spirit must give testimony to it.

To be more precise and to speak of the Christian religion, we know that Christ came into the world almost 2000 years ago. He said, however, “I am with you all days, even to the end of the world,” and “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there in the midst of them.” Still, this was not to be the sensible presence of this individual person. He also said , when I am no longer with you, “the Spirit will lead you to all truth,” i.e., the relation of externality must first be removed; it is not the true relationship. Herein we find an elucidation (_Erklarung_) of what we said above.

On the one hand we have to do there with a representative consciousness, where the content is an object, and it is outside us, separated from us. On the other hand we have devotion, cult, the feeling of union with this object. The result is a certain ambiguity; at one time externality is stronger, at another, devotion. At one time the indwelling Christ is sent back 2000 years to Palestine and is simply an historical person in th at land and those surroundings. At another time, however, in devotion and in cult, the feeling of His presence is predominant. Consequently, at this point there is to be found a contrast in religion.

**c.** _Representation and Thought._ The form of philosophy differs from the aforementioned form of religion, and we must now get a more precise understanding of this difference. The fundamental connection between religion and philosophy is the nature of spirit itself.

(1) With regard to spirit the point of departure must be [the realization] that spirit is in manifesting itself; it is this _one_ substantial identity, but at the same time, in manifesting itself it is differentiated within itself. This is where its subjective, finite consciousness comes in. (That which has its limit in another, be cause at its limit the other begins, is finite; and this is true only where there is a determination, a difference.) Spirit, however, remains free; it remains with itself in being manifested, with the result that it is not disturbed by reason of the difference. To spirit, that which is differentiated is transparent; it is something clear, not something obscure. To put it another way, for spirit there is nothing determinate in the sense that determination means difference. Now, when there is talk of a limit to spirit, from one point of view this is correct; man is limited, dependent, finite – except insofar as he is spirit. Finitude has to do with the other modes of his existence. To the extent that, even though he is spirit, his attitude is spirit less, he is involved with external things; but when he is spirit and truly spirit he is unlimited. The limits of reason are only the limits of this subject’s reason; but when man’s attitude is genuinely rational he is without limits, infinite. (Of course, infinity is not to be taken in the abstract sense, as a concept of understanding.) Because spirit is infinite it continues to be spirit in all its relationships, expressions, manifestations. The difference between universal, substantial spirit and merely subjective spirit is a difference for spirit itself. Both spirit as object and the content of spirit must be at the same time immanent in subjective spirit; and this can be only when the immanence is spiritual, not natural or immediate. This is the fundamental characteristic of Christianity, which sees man illuminated by grace, by the Holy Spirit (who is essential Spirit). Then it is that the spirit is immanent in man, is, thus, his own spirit. A living spirit such as this is, is, so to speak, phosphorus, the volatile, flammable material which can be ignited both from without and from within. It is ignited from without, for example, when man is taught the content of religion, when his emotions and imagination (_Vorstellung_) are aroused by such a teaching, or when he accepts it on authority. When his attitude is spiritual, he is on the contrary inflamed from within himself; because he looks for the content of religion within himself, it is from out of himself that he manifests it. Then he is his most intimate self.

(2) To go further, we must speak of the way in which spirit is objective to itself, of what it is for it to be for itself. The form in which it is present can vary; thus it can assume a variety of forms. From these diverse ways of appearing (_Gestaltungsweisen_) comes the diversity of forms of spirit and, thus, the difference between philosophy and religion.

In religion, spirit has its own peculiar form, which can be sensible, e.g., in the form of art, when art pictures divinity, or in poetry, where likewise the sensible representation constitutes the essence of the being-present. In general we can say that this way of manifesting spirit is _representation._ It is true, of course, that in religious representation thinking, too, is to some extent involved, but the representation contains thought in such a way that the latter is mingled with an ordinary external content. By the same token, law and morality too are, as it is said, suprasensible, but my representation of them takes its origin from custom, from legal prescriptions (_Bestimmungen_) which are already there, or from feeling. With regard to philosophy, then, the difference is that in it the same content is grasped, but the form is that of thinking. In religion there are two moments: (1) there is an objective form or determination of consciousness, whereby essential Spirit, the absolute, is present as external to subjective spirit, i.e., as its object, and is represented as historical or as an artistic image, separated in time and space; (2) there is the character or stage of devotion, of intimacy, wherein the separation is removed, the gap is bridged, wherein Spirit and object are one, and the individual is filled with the Spirit. Philosophy and religion have the same object, the same content, the same goal. But, what are in religion two stages, two modes of objectivity, i.e., art, faith and then devotion, are in philosophy united into one; for thought is (a) from the point. of view of the first character objective and has the form of an object; whereas (b) it has also lost the form of objectivity, such that in thinking, content and form are posited as unified. To the extent that what I think – i.e., the content of thinking – is in the form of thought, it no longer stands over against me.

In religion and philosophy, then, there _is one_ substantial content, and only the manner of manifesting it in each is different. These two manifestations, however, are not merely different; in their difference they can appear to be opposed, even contradictory, because the content is represented as essentially linked to the image. Still, even within the framework of religion it is conceded that the different manner of presentation which characterizes religion is not to be taken literally. Thus, it is said: God generated His Son. The divine Spirit’s self-knowledge, His making Himself into an object, is here called generating His Son. In the Son the Father knows Himself, because the Son is of the same nature as He. This relationship, however, is taken from vital nature, not from the spiritual; its expression is characteristic of representation. It is said, of course, that the relationship is not to be taken literally; but it is simply left at that. So too, when the mythologies speak of the wars of the gods, it is admitted that this sort of thing is being said partly of spiritual and partly too of natural forces. Because they are opposed to each other they are in, this way imaginatively represented.

(3) It is natural that these diverse forms, as for the first time they appear in a determinate way, and are aware of the differences which separate them, should be inimical to each other; it is, in fact, inevitable. Thought, after an, first makes its appearance as abstract, i.e., as formally incomplete. The same is true of religion, since initial immediate religious consciousness, even though it is consciousness of spirit, of that which is in and for itself, still involves a sensible form and sensible attributes, i.e., it too is abstract. Thereafter thinking becomes more concrete, penetrates more profoundly into itself, and brings to consciousness the concept of spirit as such. Thus aware of itself, it is no longer inseparable from its abstract determination. The concept of concrete spirit is its own self-conception, or it involves an essential conception of itself, having determination in itself (determination being what is counted as belonging to understanding, to the essence of appearance). Within itself abstract understanding denies all determination and, thus, with regard to God retains what is left, which is no more than His abstract designation as supreme being. On the contrary, the concrete concept has nothing to do with such a _caput mortuum_; its object is concrete, active, self-determining, living spirit. Subsequently, therefore, concrete spirit recognizes in religion the concrete, determinateness in general, not the sensible but the essential. The Jewish God, for example, God the Father, is abstract. In a later stage of its development spirit recognizes what is essential in that. The concrete, however, is not merely God as such, but rather God determining Himself, positing another than Himself, and yet as Spirit He does not leave the other simply another but is with Himself in this other. Only this latter is the complete divine Spirit. What is concrete in religion, however, can be known and recognized only in the concept which is itself concrete. Therein lies the possibility of reconciling religion and philosophy, when abstract understanding struggles against the former.

The historical progress of this opposition is approximately the following. Thinking takes its start at first within religion’s representations and subsequently parallels them, with the result that the opposition is not yet conscious. Later, however, when thinking is strengthened and relies on itself, it declares its opposition to the form of religion and will not recognize its own concept therein, seeking as it does only itself. This fight against the form of religion took place early in the history of the Greek world. In as early a case as Xenophanes’ we see a philosopher most vigorously combating the representations of Greek popular religion; and later we see the opposition stiffen, as philosophers arose who expressly denied the gods and hence the ,divine character of the popular religion. Socrates was charged with having introduced new gods. As a matter of fact, his daimonion and the overall principle of his system were contrary to the form of Greek religion and of customary morality. Still, he held on to the practices of his religion, and we know that as he was dying he ordered that a cock be sacrificed to Aesculapius. It was only very late that the Neoplatonists recognized the universal content of the popular religion, which had been either expressly attacked or put aside by the philosophers. We see not only that the Neoplatonists gave to mythological representations a meaning proper to thought but that they also employed these representations as a sort of imaginative language for their own system.

The path which this opposition follows in the Christian religion is quite similar. At first thinking is dependent, unfree, tied to the religious form. Thus it is with the Church Fathers. With them, thinking develops the elements of Christian doctrine. (The latter becomes a system only in the hands of the Church Fathers who were also philosophers. The developed aspect of ecclesiastical faith emerged in a special way in Luther’s time. At that time and frequently thereafter in more recent times there was a desire to effect a return of Christian religion to its primitive form. This sort of thing has, it is true, a good sense, in that men were concerned with what is authentic and original in Christian teaching, something which was particularly necessary at the time of the Reformation. Nevertheless, it also involves the incorrect notion that the elements should not be developed.) The first step, then, was that thinking expanded the teaching and developed it into a system; subsequently the doctrine was fixed and made into an absolute presupposition for thinking. First, then, comes the development of doctrine; secondly comes its fixation. Only after that does the opposition of believing and thinking, of immediate doctrinal certitude and so-called reason, enter in. Thinking reached the point where it relied only on itself; the first thing the young eagle of reason did was to soar as a bird of prey to the sun of truth, from there to declare war on religion. Then, however, once more justice is done to the religious content also, in that thinking finds its completion in the concrete concept of spirit and enters into a polemic against abstract understanding.

Religion, then, has a content common to itself and to philosophy; it differs from philosophy only in its form. Thus, all that is required for philosophy is that the form of the concept be so far perfected as to be able to comprise the content of religion. This content is primarily what have been called the mysteries of religion, which is to say, the speculative element in religion. Under that heading is understood first of all something mysterious, something which must remain secret and is not to be made known. It is true, of course, that by their nature, i.e., precisely as a speculative content, mysteries are something mysterious for understanding; not, however, for reason. They are, in fact, precisely the rational element, in the sense of being speculative, i.e., in the sense of the concrete concept. Philosophy is opposed to rationalism, particularly in contemporary theology. Rationalism, it is true, is always talking about reason, but what it is really talking about is merely dry, abstract understanding. Nothing in it. is recognizable as reason, except the moment of self-thinking; but even that is a completely abstract thinking. This sort of rationalism is opposed to philosophy both in its content and in its form. From the point of view of content: it has made heaven empty – reduced the divine to a _caput mortuum_, and everything else to mere finite entities in space and time. Even from the point of view of form it is contrary to philosophy; for the form of this rationalism is argumentation (_Rasonnieren_)_,_ unfree argumentation, and it declares its opposition to philosophy in particular, in order to be able to continue this sort of argumentation forever. That is no philosophizing, no genuine conceptual thinking (_Begreifen_)_._ Within religion the opposition to rationalism comes from supranaturalism, and this latter is in regard to true content like philosophy and in agreement with it, but different as regards form; for in supranaturalism the spirit is entirely absent, it has become wooden and accepts only positive authority for its corroboration and justification. The Scholastics, on the contrary, were not this sort of supranaturalists; in their thinking they put the dogma of the Church into the form of concept.

As a thinking of this content in the form of concept, over against the representation which is proper to religion, philosophy has the advantage of understanding both. It understands religion and can accord it a justification; it understands rationalism and supranaturalism. too; and it also understands itself. The converse, however, is not true; religion as such, because its point of view is that of the representation, recognizes itself only in representation, and not in philosophy, i.e., not in concepts, not in universal thought-determinations. Often enough no injustice is being done to a philosophy when the complaint is made that it is opposed to religion; frequently, however, the complaint is also unjustified, namely, when the complaint is made from the religious point of view, simply because religion does not understand philosophy.

Philosophy, then, is not contrary to religion; it grasps the latter in _concept._ For the absolute Idea, however, for absolute Spirit there must be the form of religion, for religion is the form proper to consciousness of the true, the way it is for all men. The structure of religion is **(1)** sense perception. and **(2)** mingling with the latter the form of the universal, i.e., reflection, thinking, but still, abstract thinking, which still contains much that is external. Thereafter a ‘transition is made to the concrete structuring of thoughts, there is speculation on the true, which is then in consciousness according to its true form. Nevertheless, the speculative element which enters into the structuring at this point is not the externally universal form of thinking which is common for all men; and so the consciousness of that which is in itself true must have the religious form.

This is the general justification of the religious form [of spirit’s manifestation].

Up to this point we have given an account of the difference between philosophy and religion. With regard, however, to what we want to treat of in the history of philosophy there are a few further remarks to make in connection with – and partly as a consequence of – what has already been said.

#### 3. The Kinds of Religious Contents which Are to be Eliminated from Philosophical Consideration

**a.** The first remark concerns the simply (_uberhaupt_) mythological. It is said that _mythology contains philosophical_ affirmations, and, it is also said, since in general religious forms of expression involve philosophical affirmations, philosophy must concern itself with such forms of expression. (i) In this regard the work of my friend Creuzer is well known; therein in a distinctively philosophical way he treated mythology and in general the religious representations, expressions, and usages of ancient peoples, showing what was rational in them. Now this method of treatment is attacked by others as an incorrect and unhistorical procedure. The objection is that it is not an historical fact that such philosophical affirmations are contained therein. Included in the mythological are also the mystery religions of the ancients, and in them we are presented with perhaps more philosophical affirmations than in mythology. That objection has already been taken care of by what was said earlier. It is clear enough that in mythology and in the mystery religions of the ancients such thoughts are to be found, since religions and, by the same token, the mythological elements in them are products of man, wherein he has bequeathed to posterity (_niedergelegt hat_) what to him was supreme and most profound – his consciousness of what the true is. Consequently there is no question that in the forms of mythology are contained reason, universal notions and determinations, and hence philosophical affirmations also. Now, when Creuzer is faulted for introducing such thoughts where they are not really present, for allegorizing, it is important to note that Creuzer shares with the Neoplatonists the tendency to seek philosophical affirmations in the mythological. That does not, however, mean injecting such elements; they are actually there. This sort of consideration, then, is rational and is to be raised to the absolute level. The religions and mythologies which peoples have developed are products of reason becoming conscious of itself.. No matter how naive or nonsensical they may seem, they still contain the rational moment; instinctive rationality is fundamental to them. The method employed by Creuzer and the Neoplatonists, then, is to be recognized as in itself the true and essential method.

Because, however, the mythological is the sensible, contingent presentation of the concept, what has been thought about it or developed out of it always continues to be bound to its external form. But the sensible is not the genuine element in which thought or concept can be presented.

This sort of presentation, then, is always inadequate to the concept. The sensible form must always be described from many sides, e.g., from those of history, of nature, and of art.

It involves so much by way of contingent addition, which makes it fail to correspond exactly with the concept and, in fact, to contradict the intrinsic concept. Nevertheless the Neoplatonists did achieve a new recognition of their own philosophy under the sensible image proper to mythology, and they employed such images as forms for the expression of their own concepts. It is natural to assume that in the explanation of those images, even when they are connected with an intrinsic concept, a good deal of error gets in, especially when it comes down to details, to the multitude of usages, activities, utensils, vestments, ritual sacrifices, etc.

Therein can be found something analogous to thought, a relationship to thought; but this simply shows how separate from each other are the image and its significance and how much contingency and arbitrariness can intervene and obscure the issue. Still, there is rationality here, and it must be taken into consideration. It is to be excluded, however, from our examination of the history of philosophy, for in philosophy we have nothing to do with such vague philosophical affirmations – i.e., with general ways of representing the true – or with thoughts which are merely contained in some presentation or other or lie hidden and undeveloped under some sensible image. We are concerned with thoughts which are externalized and only to the extent to which they are externalized – to the extent, then, that the sort of content proper to religion has appeared, been manifested, and come to consciousness. The difference is enormous. In a child, too, reason is present, but only as a capacity. In the history of philosophy, however, we are concerned with reason only insofar as it has been articulated in the form of thought. The philosophical affirmations which are contained only _implicite_ in religion, then, do not concern us.

(2) We can also believe that many philosophical affirmations were to be found in the mystery religions; in any event they presented symbolically adumbrations of later, superior representations. Still, a good deal of the sensible is mingled in them. They probably belong to the very ancient remnants of nature-religion which have, in fact, retreated into darkness. In general what is retained in the mystery religions belongs to a stage of culture far below that to which the people have attained. In the Christian religion, mysteries essentially contain the speculative. The Neoplatonists called the speculative concept mystical. The terms muein, mueisqai (consecrate oneself, be consecrated) signified to be engaged in speculative philosophy. Consequently there is nothing unknown in these mysteries; their name signifies not something mysterious (_Geheimnis_) but rather consecration. Thus, all Athenians were consecrated into the Eleusinian mysteries (and philologically speaking the same observation is to be made, for the same notion [_Vorstellung_] holds there); Socrates alone is an exception. The only thing that was forbidden was to reveal these things publicly before strangers; with regard to some of them it was made a crime to do so. What we find in the Christian religion is similar; there dogmas are called mysteries. They are what is known of God’s nature and disseminated as doctrine. Thus, a mystery is not something unknown or hidden; it is something revealed, familiar, what everyone in the community knows; and it is by this knowledge that they are distinguished from members of other religions. Here, too, then, _mysterium_ does not mean secret (since every Christian is in on the secret); it is simply another name for the speculative. For the senses, for sensual man with his desires and his ordinary understanding, it is, of course, a secret; for understanding finds only contradictions anywhere in the speculative; it finds difference impenetrable and cannot grasp the concrete. _Mysterium,_ or the idea, however, is at the same time the resolution of contradictions. We are here concerned with mysteries, then, only to the extent that in them thought as thought, articulated in the form of thought, is present.

**b.** _Mythical Philosophizing._ It can also be claimed that _myths are a way of philosophizing;_ and that they have also often been so. Mythical language is also deliberately used, as it is said, in order to evoke sublime ideas. Plato, for example, employs many myths. Jacobi, too, belongs to this number, since he employs the forms of Christian religion in his philosophizing and in this manner says the most speculative things. This form, however, is not the correct one or the one which suits philosophy. Thought which has itself as object must be, in its form too, object for itself; it has to have risen above its natural form and to have appeared also in the form of thought. There is a fairly prevalent opinion that Plato’s myths are superior to his more abstract mode of expression; nor is there any question that Plato does present them beautifully. When we consider them more carefully we see that his myths are partly the result of an inability to get thought across to human beings in a purer form. Partly, too, Plato speaks this way only to introduce his themes – when he comes to the principal theme, however, his manner of expression is different. Aristotle says: “Those who philosophize mythically do not deserve to be taken seriously.” That is true. Still, when Plato employs myths he certainly has good reasons for so doing. In general, however, the mythical form is not the one in which thought is best portrayed; it is only a subordinate way.

Just as the Freemasons have symbols which count as deep wisdom – deep in the way that we call a well deep when we cannot see the bottom – so men are easily convinced that what is hidden is deep. But, when something is concealed, it may well be the case that there is nothing behind the concealment. Thus, among the Freemasons what is totally hidden (not only from outsiders but also from insiders) is really nothing and requires neither a special wisdom nor science. It belongs precisely to thought, on the other hand, to manifest itself; it is its very nature to be clear. Manifestation is not, so to speak, a situation which can take place or not, such that thought would continue to be thought whether manifested or not – manifestation is its very being. [This paragraph inserted from Michelet’s first edition of 1833.]

Others have employed _lines, numbers,_ and _geometrical figures_ as symbols. A snake biting its own tail, for example, or a circle count as symbols of eternity. Such a symbol is a sensible image; spirit, however, does not need that sort of symbol, it has language. If spirit can express itself in the element proper to thought, then the symbolic is an incorrect, a false mode of presentation. When we talk about Pythagoras we shall come back to this point. This sort of thing is found among the Chinese, too; they use lines and numbers to signify thoughts.

So, the mythical as such and mythical forms of philosophizing are excluded from what we have to say.

**c.** _The Place of Thoughts in Poetry and Religion._ The third remark to be made is that _religion as such,_ like _poetry,_ contains _thoughts._ The form in which religion is presented is not merely that of art, as it is particularly in Greek religion; rather it contains thoughts, universal notions. By the same token, poetry (i.e., the art whose element is language) attains to the expression of thoughts; in poets, too, we find profound universal thoughts. Thoughts such as these – e.g., on fate in Homer and the Greek tragedians, or on living and dying, being and ceasing to be, birth and death – then, are clearly abstract and important thoughts, which also are often imaginatively presented, for example, in Indian poetry. Still, in the history of philosophy we are not to consider this mode of presentation either. One could speak of a philosophy of Aeschylus, of Euripides, of Schiller, of Goethe, etc. But, such thoughts are to an extent merely incidental and, thus, not germane to our presentation; they constitute general ways of representing the true, the vocation of man, morality, etc. To an extent, also, these thoughts have not attained to the form which is proper to them; and the form which is required is that of thought, wherein what is expressed must be the ultimate and constitute the absolute foundation. With regard to the thoughts we have just spoken about that is not the case; in them there is an absence of distinction from and relation to each other. Besides, in the case of the Indians, whatever has a relation to thought is shot through with confusion.

In addition we are not concerned with those thoughts which have their source in Christian religion or in the Church. The Fathers of the Church were, it is true, great philosophers, and the growth of Christianity owes a great deal to them. Still, their philosophizing moves within the framework of an already fixed and given doctrinal concept which is fundamental to it. In the same way we do not see among the Scholastics the sort of free thought which develops from itself and builds upon itself; rather we see that their thought is tied to all sorts of presuppositions.

This, then, is what I wanted to say by way of introduction to our treatment of the history of philosophy. Two points in particular have been emphasized in what we have said about the relationship which these last types of thinking have to philosophy. One of these concerned the formal element, self-thinking in general as it occurs in the natural sciences, in what might be called popular philosophy. In that case it was the form which is common to them and to philosophy; whereas the determination of content, the matter, is not developed from the thought itself, but comes from elsewhere, from nature or from feeling, or, as is often the case, sound common sense (_Menschenverstand_) is adopted as a criterion (as in Scottish philosophy). The other aspect was the substantial, which religion in particular shares with philosophy. In this case, however, what is lacking to the substantial element is the form of thought. Thus, what remains for philosophy is simply the substantial element in the form of thought.

## C. GENERAL DIVISION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY

### II. The Beginning of the History of Philosophy

The question now to be asked is: where is the history of philosophy to begin? The answer to this question is already contained immediately in what has preceded. The history of philosophy begins where thought in its freedom comes into existence, where it cuts itself loose from its immersion in and unity with nature, constitutes itself for itself, where thinking goes into itself and remains with itself.

From the historical point of view this emergence of spirit is intimately connected with the flowering of political liberty; and political liberty, liberty within the state, begins where the individual feels himself to be an individual, where the subject knows himself in a universal manner, or where the consciousness of personality, of having in oneself infinite value, comes into the open – because I posit myself for myself and have value simply for myself. Herein is contained, too, free thinking of the object, the absolute, the essential universal object. To think means to put something into the form of universality. To think oneself, then, means to give oneself the determination of universality, to know oneself as universal – to know that I am a universal, an infinite – i.e., to know oneself as a free being relating oneself to oneself. That is precisely where the moment of practical political freedom comes in. Philosophical thinking is immediately connected with this sort of thing because it, too, appears as thought of the universal object. Thought is determined as something universal; which means (a) it makes of the universal its _object_ or of the objective something universal. It determines the individuality of natural things, the way they are in sensible consciousness, as a universal, a thought, an objective thought. There we have the objective, but as thought. (b) Added to this is the second determination: I _recognize_ this universal, thought _knows_ that the universal happens. This more precise relation of recognition and of knowledge to the universal enters in only to the extent that the objective in question continues to be for me the objective and that I continue to grasp myself for myself. Insofar as I think the objective, it is mine; and even though it is my thinking, it counts for me as the absolutely universal. Insofar as it is present as objective, I have thought myself in it; I myself am contained in this infinite and at the same time. I am conscious of this. Thus, I retain the standpoint of objectivity and at the same time that of knowing, and I maintain the latter standpoint. That, in general, is the connection between political freedom and the emergence of freedom of thought.

Philosophy, then, makes its appearance in history when there exist free political institutions. In this connection the Orient first comes to mind. In the Oriental world, however, there can be no question of philosophy properly speaking: for, to characterize the situation briefly, spirit does arise in the Orient, but conditions are such that the subject, the individuality, is not a person, but is determined as being swallowed up in the objective. There the substantial relation is dominant. There substance is represented partly as suprasensible, as thought, partly as more on the side of the material. The relation which the individual or the particular has, then, is simply that of being a negative over against the substantial. The highest which such an individual can achieve is eternal blessedness, which consists in being simply submerged in this substance, in abdicating consciousness, and thus being annihilated as subject, with a consequent destruction of the difference between substance and subject. The supreme relationship, then, is unconsciousness. Now, insofar as individuals have not attained this blessedness but exist still in an earthly way they are excluded from the unity of the substantial and the individual. The relation they have is that of being determined as without spirit, without substance and – as regards political freedom – without rights. Will in this case is not substantial will but only one which is determined by the arbitrariness and contingency of nature (e.g., by the caste system); it is a being without inner consciousness.

There is the fundamental situation of the Oriental character. What is affirmative is simply substance, and the individual is without substance, it is accidental. Political liberty, rights, moral freedom, pure consciousness, thinking – all are absent. If these are to come about, it is necessary that the subject, too, posit himself as consciousness over against the substance and be recognized for what he is. But, in the Oriental character the subject does not count as thus knowing himself. The subject is not there for himself and he has in his own self-consciousness no value for himself. The Oriental subject can, it is true, be great, noble, sublime; still what characterizes him chiefly is that as an individual he is without rights and that what he makes of himself is determined either by nature or by arbitrariness. Nobility, sublimity, the utmost magnanimity of attitude, are .among the Orientals arbitrariness of character and by the same token contingent. Missing are such things as rights and moral standards, which consist in objective and positive determinations, to be respected by all, are valid for all, and in which all are accorded recognition. When the Oriental acts he has the advantage of complete independence, since for him there is nothing fixed and determined. The freer and more undetermined his substance is, the more arbitrary and independent is he. A free substance such as this no more has the character of an objectivity which is valid for all universally than it has freedom. What we call rights, moral standards, the state, are there present in a natural, substantial, patriarchal way, i.e., without subjective freedom. The kind of morality which we call conscience is also nonexistent there. What does exist there is a petrified natural order which permits what is worst to exist side by side with supreme nobility. The situation is such that in it supreme arbitrariness holds the highest place.

Consequently philosophical knowledge is not to be looked for in the Orient, since it is proper to philosophical knowledge to be conscious of, to know, the substance, i.e., the universal insofar as I think it, develop it within me, determine it, in such a way that in the substance I have my own determinations and am also contained subjectively or affirmatively. In this way the determinations in question are not merely subjective, not merely opinions, but just as they are my thoughts so too are they thoughts of what is, objective; they are substantial thoughts.

What belongs to the Orient, then, is to be excluded from the history of philosophy. Still, in the overall treatment, I shall, nevertheless, say a few words about it, particularly the Indian and the Chinese. Previously I have ignored Oriental thought, but recently it has become possible to pass judgment in its regard. Formerly it was customary to acclaim Indian wisdom and even to make a great fuss about it, without anyone knowing exactly why. Only now do we have more precise information, which corresponds naturally to its somewhat general character. It is not enough, how. ever, simply to contrast the universal concept with the former sort of vague conjecture; we must now, wherever possible, proceed historically.

Philosophy properly so called has its beginning only in the West. There the spirit is submerged in itself, immerses itself in itself, posits itself as free, and is free for itself. Only under such conditions can philosophy exist; and by the same token, only in the West do we find free political institutions. The happiness and the infinity which characterize the individual in the West are determined in such a way that within the substantial the subject holds its own, is not demeaned, does not appear as a slave, destined for annihilation in its dependence on the substance.

### II. Progress in the History of Philosophy

In the West, then, we stand on philosophy’s own proper ground. There we must consider two great forms, we must distinguish two main periods: (1) _Greek_ philosophy, and (2) _Germanic_ philosophy. The latter is philosophy in the framework of Christianity or philosophy insofar as it pertains to the Germanic peoples, which is the reason why it can be called Germanic philosophy. Through the influence of the Germanic nations the other European nations – Italy, Spain, France, England, etc. – have taken on a new form.

Greek philosophy differs from Germanic philosophy just as much as Greek art does from Germanic art. Greek influence, however, reaches into the, Germanic world, and the Romans constitute the link between the two. In speaking .of Greek philosophy we must speak of it as settling in the Roman world, because Greek culture was adopted in the Roman world. The Romans, however, no more produced a philosophy of their own than a poetry of their own; even their religion is properly speaking Greek.

To characterize more precisely the two major contrasting forms we can say that the Greek world developed thought into the Idea, whereas the Christian or Germanic world comprehended the thought of Spirit. The line of demarcation is that between idea and spirit.

We can describe this advance more precisely in the following way. The first step in the process is necessarily the most abstract; it is the simplest and most impoverished, in contrast to the concrete. It is not yet diversified, not yet determined in a variety of ways; and, thus, the most ancient philosophies are the poorest of all. The first stage, then, is totally simple. After this, more precise determinations and figurations are constructed on this simple basis. When, for example, it is said that the universal, the absolute, is water or the infinite or being, then the universal has been determined as water, the infinite, or being. Still, the determinations themselves remain thoroughly general, non-conceptual, and undetermined. Likewise, when it is said that the universal is the atom, the one, this too is an indeterminate determination. The next stage in the development is the grasp of the universal as aware of itself, self-determining – it is thought as active in a universal way. What comes at this stage is more concrete, but it is still somewhat abstract. It is the nous of Anaxagoras or, better still, of Socrates, the .beginning of a subjective totality, where thinking comprehends itself, and nous is determined as being thinking activity. At a third stage this abstract totality has to realize itself, and that in diversified determinations (active thought is that which determines and diversifies), and these diversified, realized determinations are themselves elevated to totalities. On this level the universal and the particular are contrasted, as are thinking as such and external reality, or indications of externality, such as sensations, etc. Stoicism and Epicureanism become contrasting philosophies; and these contraries are united in a higher. This latter can consist in a destruction of the other two, as in skepticism; but the affirmative union of the two is their synthesis (_Aufhebung_) in a higher totality, in the Idea. This stage can be called a realization of the concept. The concept is the universal, which is determined for itself and yet retains its unity along with its determination into individualities in such a way that the latter are transparent to it.

Thus, when I say I, many determinations are involved, but the determinations are _mine,_ they do not become independent; in them I continue to be the same myself. A further’ step is the realization of the concept, such that the determinations themselves become totalities (the infinite goodness of the concept), participating fully in the concept, with the result that the latter’s aspects become totalities separated from each other, whether indifferently side by side or in conflict with each other. This third level is one of unification, where the Idea is such that differences are concrete and at the same time are contained (or have been held) in the unity of the concept. Greek philosophy came that far. It closes with the intellectual, ideal world of Alexandrian philosophy.

In this world, however, in this idea of totality, _one_ determination is still lacking. I said, you will recall, that the Idea is, that the concept determines itself, particularizes itself, that it develops its two major aspects, positing them as identical. In this identity the independent totalities which are the aspects are also posited as negative; and it is through this negation that the identity becomes subjectivity, absolute being-for-itself, i.e., actuality. In this way the Idea is elevated to Spirit. Spirit is the subjectivity which knows itself. It is its own object; and its object (i.e., itself) it makes into a totality. Thus, it is itself totality and knows itself as totality for itself. This principle of absolute being-for-itself or of freedom is the principle of the Christian world, wherein the one determination is precisely this, that as such man has an infinite worth. Christian religion expresses this more precisely by saying that each individual is to attain blessedness. Thereby an infinite worth is attributed to each individual. The principle of the second epoch, therefore, is the Idea knowing itself.

If we want to represent this advance to ourselves imaginatively we can speak of thinking as though it were space. First of all appear the most abstract determinations of space, i.e., points and lines; thereafter the union of these in a triangle. This latter, it is true, is already concrete, but still in the abstract element of surface; a stage which corresponds to what we called nous. The next stage is that the three lines which bound it become whole figures, i.e., become the realization of the abstract, of the abstract sides of the whole. At a third stage the three surfaces, triangular sides, are joined together into a body, a totality. That is as far as Greek philosophy goes.

Once we have such a body there enters in a distinction between the center of the [enclosed] space and that which fills it [its area]. This then results in a contrast between what is totally simple and ideal (which the center is) and what is real and substantial. The uniting of both, then, is the totality of the self-knowing Idea – no longer, however, a disinterested uniting, but such that the center is self-knowing personality over against objective, physical corporeity. Within this totality of the self-knowing idea the substantial is, on the one hand, essentially distinguished from subjectivity; and yet, on the other hand, the latter as self-positing also becomes substantial. At first, of course, subjectivity is merely formal, but it is the real possibility of the substantial. Subjectivity in and for itself consists precisely in this, that the subject has the determination of fulfilling its universality, of realizing it, and of positing itself as identical with the substance.

Thus, the principle of philosophy in the modern era on the one hand consists in the moment of ideality or subjectivity being for itself as such or in existing as singularity. With this there comes into being what we call subjective freedom. This latter, however, is at the same time universal, since the subject as such, i.e., man as man, is free and has the infinite determination of becoming substantial, which is the other determination found in Christian religion, namely that man has the capacity to be spirit. The sort of subjective and universal freedom which we see here is something entirely different from the partial freedom which we saw in Greece. Among the Greeks it was properly speaking only contingent that the subjectivity be free. In the Oriental world only one is free, i.e., the substance. The Spartan or Attic citizen is free, but among them there were also slaves, and so in the Greek world only some are free. What we are now saying is something else again; we say that man as man is free. In this way the characteristic freedom is completely universal. The subject as such is thought of as free, and the characteristic applies to all.

In the Christian religion the principle of which we speak has been rather expressed in the form of feeling and representation than articulated in the form of pure thought. The religion includes the belief that man as man, each individual, is an object of divine grace and mercy; thus each is a subject for himself and has an infinite, absolute value. More precisely, this principle is to be found in the fact that the Christian religion contains as a dogma the recognition of the unity between divine and human nature, a truth which has been revealed to men through Christ. Here man and God, the subjective and the objective idea, are one. This latter is the Germanic principle, the uniting of objectivity and subjectivity. The same teaching is already contained in a different guise in the story of the Fall. What is essential in this story is that the tree from which Adam eats is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; the rest is simply imaginary. From this point of view the serpent _did not_ deceive man, for God says: “See, Adam has become like one of us; he knows what is good and evil.” In that is contained the infinite, divine worth of subjectivity. Still, the unity of the subjective principle with substantiality, the unity of knowledge and truth, is not immediate; it is a process, the process of spirit. This means that in its unity subjectivity divests itself of its natural, immediate manner of being one and makes itself identical with what has been called the simply substantial (subjectivity as such is merely formal). Here, then, the goal of man is announced to be supreme blessedness and perfection – first of all in principle, in abstracto; the goal, then, is subjectivity which has in itself infinite worth, determined in regard to possibility.

We see, then, that speculative thought and religious representation are not separated, above all not so widely separated as is customarily believed. I have introduced such notions for another reason, i.e., in order that we be not of the opinion that as notions belonging to an earlier stage in the Christian world they are no longer of interest to us, even though we belong to that world. As a result of this, even though we may well have advanced beyond this stage we have no reason to be ashamed of our ancestors, for whom religious notions such as these were of supreme importance.

Properly speaking, then, we have two ideas, the subjective idea as knowing and the substantial or concrete idea; and the development or extension of this principle in such a way that it comes to consciousness in thought is the concern of modern philosophy. Here it is, then, that determinations are of a more concrete sort than they were among the ancients, determinations such as distinctions between thought and being, individuality and substantiality, freedom and necessity, etc. In modern philosophy, subjectivity is for itself but posits itself identically with the substantial or concrete, so that the substantial in question reaches thought. The knowing of what is for itself free is the principle of modern philosophy. There it is that this knowing, both as immediate certainty and as a knowing which is yet to be developed, is of particular interest, because through it the opposition between certainty and belief or even between belief and the sort of knowing that develops within itself is constructed. Thus a knowing which is first to be developed in some subject or other and also the belief which is a knowing are opposed to certainty or to the true in general. Consequently subjectivity and objectivity are opposed to each other. In both, however, the unity of thinking or subjectivity and truth or objectivity is presupposed. The difference is that in the first form it is said: existing man (i.e., natural man in his immediate ordinariness) cognizes the true in immediate knowing, in believing; the way he believes it is, so it truly is. In the second form, on the other hand, it is true that the unity of knowing and truth is also present, but at the same time there is the fact that man, the subject, raises himself above sensible consciousness, above the immediate manner of knowing, and only through thought makes himself what he is, thus attaining to truth.

On the whole, then, we have two philosophies: (1) Greek and (2) Germanic. With regard to the second of these we must distinguish between the period in which it makes its appearance as philosophy and the period of preparation. We can begin to deal with Germanic philosophy only at the point where it makes its appearance in a form peculiar to itself. Between the two great periods, then, lies a middle period, one of fermentation.

The point at which we now stand is the result of all the work that has been done over a period Of 2300 years; it is what the World-Spirit has brought before itself in its thinking consciousness. We should not wonder at the slowness of this. Universal, knowing Spirit has time, it is not in a hurry; it has at its disposal masses of peoples and nations whose development is precisely a means to the emergence of its consciousness. Nor should we become impatient because particular insights are not brought out at this time but only later, or that this or that is not yet there – in world-history advances are slow. Thus, insight into the necessity of such a long time is a remedy for our impatience.

We have, then, to consider three periods in the history of philosophy: **(1)** Greek philosophy from Thales, about 600 B.C. (Thales was born in either 640 or 629 B.C. and died in either the 58th or 59th Olympiad, i.e., about 550 B.C.), to the Neoplatonists, among whom was Plotinus who lived in the third century after Christ. It can be said, however, that this period stretched into the fifth century, at which time on the one hand all pagan philosophy is at an end – a fact which is connected with the great migration and the downfall of the Roman Empire (the death of Proclus, last of the great Neoplatonists, is put in A.D. 485 and the sack of Rome under Odoacer in 476) – whereas on the other hand Neoplatonism continues without interruption in the work of the Church Fathers – many philosophies within Christendom have as their only foundation Neoplatonism. The time-span, then, takes in about 1000 years. **(2)** The second period is that of the Middle Ages, the period of fermentation and of preparation for modern philosophy. Here belong the Scholastics. There are also Arab and Jewish philosophies to be mentioned, but the most important ones were those of the Christian Church. This period, too, lasts about 1000 years. **(3)** The third period, when modern philosophy makes its formal appearance, does not begin until the time of the Thirty Years’ War, with Bacon (d. 1626), Jakob Boehme (cL.1624), or Descartes (d. 1650). With Descartes thinking began to enter into itself. “Cogito ergo sum” are the first words of his system; and it is precisely these words which express the difference between modem philosophy and all that preceded it.

## III. The Idea of History and its Realization

The question of how Reason is determined in itself and what its relation is to the world coincides with the question, _What is the ultimate purpose of the world?_ This question implies that the purpose is to be actualized and realized. Two things, then, must be considered: first, the content of this ultimate purpose, the determination as such, and, secondly, its realization.

To begin with, we must note that world history goes on within the realm of Spirit. The term “world” includes both physical and psychical nature. Physical nature does play a part in world history, and from the very beginning we shall draw attention to the fundamental natural relations thus involved. But Spirit, and the course of its development, is the substance of history. We must not contemplate nature as a rational system in itself, in its own particular domain, but only in its relation to Spirit.

After the creation of nature appears Man. He constitutes the antithesis to the natural world; he is the being that lifts itself up to the second world. We have in our universal consciousness two realms, the realm of Nature and the realm of Spirit. The realm of Spirit consists in what is produced by man. One may have all sorts of ideas about the Kingdom of God; but it is always a realm of Spirit to be realized and brought about in man.

The realm of Spirit is all-comprehensive; it includes everything that ever has interested or ever will interest man. Man is active in it; whatever he does, he is the creature within which the Spirit works. Hence it is of interest, in the course of history, to learn to know spiritual nature in its existence, that is, the point where Spirit and Nature unite, namely, human nature. In speaking of human nature we mean something permanent. The concept of human nature must fit all men and all ages, past and present. This universal concept may suffer infinite modifications; but actually the universal is one and the same essence in its most various modifications. Thinking reflection disregards the variations and adheres to the universal, which under all circumstances is active in the same manner and shows itself in the same interest. The universal type appears even in what seems to deviate from it most strongly; in the most distorted figure we can still discern the human. ...

This kind of reflection abstracts from the content, the purpose of human activity. ... But the cultured human mind cannot help making distinctions between inclinations and desires as they manifest themselves in small circumstances and as they appear in the struggle of world-wide historical interests. Here appears an objective interest, which impresses us in two aspects, that of the universal aim and that of the individual who represents this aim. It is this which makes history so fascinating. These are the aims and individuals whose loss and decline we mourn. When we have before us the struggle of the Greeks against the Persians or Alexander’s mighty dominion, we know very well what interests us. We want to see the Greeks saved from barbarism, we want the Athenian state preserved, and we are interested in the ruler under whose leadership the Greeks subjugated Asia. If it were only a matter of human passion, we would not feel any loss in imagining that Alexander would have failed in his enterprise. We could very well content ourselves in seeing here mere play of passions, but we would not feel satisfied. We have here a substantial, an objective interest. ...

In contemplating world history we must thus consider its ultimate purpose. This ultimate purpose is what is willed in the world itself. We know of God that He is the most perfect; He can will only Himself and what is like Him. God and the nature of His will are one and the same; these we call, philosophically, the Idea. Hence, it is the Idea in general, in its manifestation as human spirit, which we have to contemplate. More precisely, it is the idea of human freedom. The purest form in which the Idea manifests itself is Thought itself. In this aspect the Idea is treated in Logic. Another form is that of physical Nature. The third form, finally, is that of Spirit in general.

Spirit, on the stage on which we observe it, that of world history, is in its most concrete reality. But nevertheless – or rather in order to understand also the general idea of this concrete existence of Spirit – we must set forth, first, some general definition of the _nature of Spirit._ But this can only be done here as a mere assertion; this is not the place to develop the idea of Spirit through philosophical speculation. As was mentioned above, what can be said in an introduction can be taken only historically – as an assumption to be explained and proved elsewhere or to be verified by the science of history itself.

We have therefore to indicate here:

(1) The abstract characteristics of the nature of Spirit.

(2) The means Spirit uses in order to realize its Idea.

(3) The form which the complete realization of Spirit assumes in existence – the State.

### 1. The Idea of Freedom

The nature of Spirit may be understood by a glance at its direct opposite – Matter. The essence of matter is gravity, the essence of Spirit – its substance – is Freedom. It is immediately plausible to everyone that, among other properties, Spirit also possesses Freedom. But philosophy teaches us that _all_ the properties of Spirit exist only through Freedom. All are but means of attaining Freedom; all seek and produce this and this alone. It is an insight of speculative philosophy that Freedom is the sole truth of Spirit.

In this aspect the Idea is treated in the Philosophy of Nature. Matter possesses gravity by virtue of its tendency toward a central point; it is essentially composite, consisting of parts that exclude each other. It seeks its unity and thereby its own abolition; it seeks its opposite. If it would attain this it would be matter no longer, but would have perished. It strives toward ideality, for in unity it exists, ideally. Spirit, on the contrary, is that which has its center in itself. It does not have unity outside of itself but has found it; it is in itself and with itself. Matter has its substance outside of itself; Spirit is Being-within-itself (self-contained existence). But this, precisely, is Freedom. For when I am dependent, I refer myself to something else which I am not; I cannot exist independently of something external. I am free when I am, within myself. This self-contained existence of Spirit is self-consciousness, consciousness of self.

Two things must be distinguished in consciousness, first, _that I know_ and, secondly, _what I know_. In self-consciousness the two coincide, for Spirit knows itself. It is the judgment of its own nature and, at the same time, the operation of coming to itself, to produce itself, to make itself (actually) into that, which it is in itself (potentially). Following this abstract definition it may be said that world history is the exhibition of spirit striving to attain knowledge of its own nature. As the germ bears in itself the whole nature of the tree, the taste and shape of its fruit, so also the first traces of Spirit virtually contain the whole of history. Orientals do not yet know that Spirit – Man as such – is free. And because they do not know it, they are not free. They only know that _one_ is free; but for this very reason such freedom is mere caprice, ferocity, dullness of passion, or, perhaps, softness and tameness of desire – which again is nothing but an accident of nature and thus, again, caprice. This one is therefore only a despot, not a free man. The consciousness of freedom first arose among the Greeks, and therefore they were free. But they, and the Romans likewise, only knew that some are free not man as such. This not even Plato and Aristotle knew. For this reason the Greeks not only had slavery, upon which was based their whole life and the maintenance of their splendid liberty, but their freedom itself was partly an accidental, transient, and limited flowering and partly a severe thralldom of human nature. Only the Germanic peoples came, through Christianity, to realize that man as man is free and that freedom of Spirit is the very essence of man’s nature. This realization first arose in religion, in the innermost region of spirit; but to introduce it in the secular world was a further task which could only be solved and fulfilled by a long and severe effort of civilization. Thus slavery did not cease immediately with the acceptance of the Christian religion. Liberty did not suddenly predominate in states nor reason in governments and constitutions. The application of the principle to secular conditions, the thorough molding and interpenetration of the secular world by it, is precisely the long process of history. I have already drawn attention to this distinction between a principle as such and its application, its introduction and execution in the actuality of life and spirit. This is a fundamental fact in our science and must be kept constantly in mind. Just as we noted it in the Christian principle of self-consciousness and freedom, so it shows itself in the principle of freedom in general. World history is the progress of the consciousness of freedom – a progress whose necessity we have to investigate.

The preliminary statement given above of the various grades in the consciousness of freedom – that the Orientals knew only that _one is_ free, the Greeks and Romans that some are free, while we know that all men absolutely, that is, as men, are free – is at the same time the natural division of world history and the manner in which we shall treat it. But this is only mentioned in passing; first, we must explain some other concepts.

We have established Spirit’s consciousness of its freedom, and thereby the actualization of this Freedom as the final purpose of the world. For the spiritual world is the substance of reality, and the physical world remains subordinate to it, or, in terms of speculative philosophy, has no truth compared with the former. But the term “freedom,” without further qualification, is indefinite and infinitely ambiguous. Being the highest concept, it is liable to an infinity of misunderstandings, confusions, and errors and may give rise to all possible kinds of extravagances. All this has never been more clearly known and experienced than today. Yet for the time being we must content ourselves with this general, as yet undefined term. Attention was also drawn to the importance of the infinite difference between the principle, as that which so far is only in itself, and that which is real. At the same time, it is Freedom in itself that comprises within itself the infinite necessity of bringing itself to consciousness and thereby, since knowledge about itself is its very nature, to reality. Freedom is itself its own object of attainment and the sole purpose of Spirit. It is the ultimate purpose toward which all world history has continually aimed. To this end all the sacrifices have been offered on the vast altar of the earth throughout the long lapse of ages. Freedom alone is the purpose which realizes and fulfills itself, the only enduring pole in the change of events and conditions, the only truly efficient principle that pervades the whole. This final aim is God’s purpose with the world. But God is the absolutely perfect Being and can, therefore, will nothing but Himself, His own will. The nature of His own will, His own nature, is what we here call the Idea of freedom. Thus we translate the language of religion into that of philosophy. Our next question then is: what are the means the Idea uses for its realization? This is the second point that we have to consider.

### 2. The Means of Realization

#### (a) The Idea and the Individual

The question of the _means_ whereby Freedom develops itself into a world leads us directly to the phenomenon of history. Although Freedom as such is primarily an internal idea, the means it uses are the external phenomena which in history present themselves directly before our eyes. The first glance at history convinces us that the actions of men spring from their needs, their passions, their interests, their characters, and their talents. Indeed, it appears as if in this drama of activities these needs, passions, and interests are the sole springs of action and the main efficient cause. It is true that this drama involves also universal purposes, benevolence, or noble patriotism But such virtues and aims are insignificant on the broad canvas of history. We may, perhaps, see the ideal of Reason actualized in those who adopt such aims and in the spheres of their influence; but their number is small in proportion to the mass of the human race and their influence accordingly limited. Passions, private aims, and the satisfaction of selfish desires are, on the contrary, tremendous springs of action. Their power lies in the fact that they respect none of the limitations which law and morality would impose on them; and that these natural impulses are closer to the core of human nature than the artificial and troublesome discipline that tends toward order, self-restraint, law, and morality.

When we contemplate this display of passions and the consequences of their violence, the unreason which is associated not only with them, but even – rather we might say specially – with good designs and righteous aims; when we see arising therefrom the evil, the vice, the ruin that has befallen the most flourishing kingdoms which the mind of man ever created, we can hardly avoid being filled with sorrow this universal taint of corruption. And since this decay is not the work of mere nature, but of human will, our reflections may well lead us to a moral sadness, a revolt of the good will (spirit) – if indeed it has a place within us. Without rhetorical exaggeration, a simple, truthful account of the miseries that have overwhelmed the noblest of nations and polities and the finest exemplars of private virtue forms a most fearful picture and excites emotions of the profoundest and most hopeless sadness, counter-balanced by no consoling result. We can endure it and strengthen ourselves against it only by thinking that this is the way it had to be – it is fate; nothing can be done. And at last, out of the boredom with which this sorrowful reflection threatens us, we draw back into the vitality of the present, into our aims and interests of the moment; we retreat, in short, into the selfishness that stands on the quiet shore and thence enjoys in safety the distant spectacle of wreckage and confusion.

But in contemplating history as the slaughter-bench at which the happiness of peoples, the wisdom of states, and the virtue of individuals have been sacrificed, a question necessarily arises: To what principle, to what final purpose, have these monstrous sacrifices been offered?

From here one usually proceeds to the starting point of our investigation: the events which make up this picture of gloomy emotion and thoughtful reflection are only the means for realizing the essential destiny, the absolute and final purpose, or, what amounts to the same thing, the true result of world history. We have all along purposely eschewed that method of reflection which ascends from this scene of particulars to general principles. Besides, it is not in the interest of such sentimental reflections really to rise above these depressing emotions and to solve the mysteries of Providence presented in such contemplations. It is rather their nature to dwell melancholically on the empty and fruitless sublimities of their negative result. For this reason we return to our original point of view, What we shall have to say about it will also answer the questions put to us by this panorama of history.

The first thing we notice – something which has been stressed more than once before but which cannot be repeated too often, for it belongs to the central point of our inquiry – is the merely general and abstract nature of what we call principle, final purpose, destiny, or the nature and concept of Spirit. A principle, a law is something implicit, which as such, however true in itself, is not completely real (actual). Purposes, principles, and the like, are at first in our thoughts, our inner intention. They are not yet in reality. That which is in itself is a possibility, a faculty. It has not yet emerged out of its implicitness into existence. A second element must be added for it to become reality, namely, activity, actualization. The principle of this is the will, man’s activity in general. It is only through this activity that the concept and its implicit (“being-in-themselves”) determinations can be realized, actualized; for of themselves they have no immediate efficacy. The activity which puts them in operation and in existence is the need, the instinct, the inclination, and passion of man. When I have an idea I am greatly interested in transforming it into action, into actuality. In its realization through my participation I want to find my own satisfaction. A purpose for which I shall be active must in some way be my purpose; I must thereby satisfy my own desires, even though it may have ever so many aspects which do not concern me. This is the infinite right of the individual to find itself satisfied in its activity and labor. If men are to be interested in anything they must have “their heart” in it. Their feelings of self-importance must be satisfied. But here a misunderstanding must be avoided. To say that an individual “has an interest” in something is justly regarded as a reproach or blame; we imply that he seeks only his private advantage. Indeed, the blame implies not only his disregard of the common interest, but his taking advantage of it and even his sacrificing it to his own interest. Yet, he who is active for a cause is not simply “interested,” but “interested _in it.”_ Language faithfully expresses this distinction. Nothing therefore happens, nothing is accomplished, unless those concerned with an issue find their own satisfaction in it. They are particular individuals; they have their special needs, instincts, and interests. They have their own particular desires and volitions, their own insight and conviction, or at least their own attitude and opinion, once the aspirations to reflect, understand, and reason have been awakened. Therefore people demand that a cause for which they should be active accord with their ideas. And they expect their opinion – concerning its goodness, justice, advantage, profit – to be taken into account. This is of particular importance today when people are moved to support a cause not by faith in other people’s authority, but rather on the basis of their own independent judgment and conviction.

We assert then that nothing has been accomplished without an interest on the part of those who brought it about. And if “interest” be called “passion” – because the whole individuality is concentrating all its desires and powers, with every fiber of volition, to the neglect of all other actual or possible interests and aims, on one object – we may then affirm without qualification that _nothing great in the world_ has been accomplished without passion.

Two elements therefore enter into our investigation: first, the Idea, secondly, the complex of human passions; the one the warp, the other the woof of the vast tapestry of world history. Their contact and concrete union constitutes moral liberty in the state. We have already spoken of the Idea of freedom as the essence of Spirit and absolutely final purpose of history. Passion is regarded as something wrong, something more or less evil; man is not supposed to have passions. “Passion,” it is true, is not quite the right word for what I wish to express. I mean here nothing more than human activity resulting from private interest, from special or, if you will, self-seeking designs – with this qualification: that the whole energy of will and character is devoted to the attainment of one aim and that other interests or possible aims, indeed everything else, is sacrificed to this aim. This particular objective is so bound up with the person’s will that it alone and entirely determines its direction and is inseparable from it. It is that which makes the person what he is. For a person is a specific existence. He is not man in general – such a thing does not exist – but a particular human being. The term “character” also expresses this uniqueness of will and intelligence. But character comprises all individual features whatever – the way in which a person conducts himself in his private and other relations. It does not connote this individuality itself in its practical and active phase. I shall therefore use the term “passion” to mean the particularity of a character insofar as its individual volitions not only have a particular content but also supply the impelling and actuating force for deeds of universal scope. Passion is thus the subjective and therefore the formal aspect, of energy, will, and activity, whose content and aim are at this point still undetermined. And a similar relation exists between individual conviction, insight, and conscience, on the one hand, and their content, on the other. If someone wants to decide whether my conviction and passion are true and substantial, he must consider the _content_ of my conviction and the _aim_ of my passion. Conversely, if they are true and substantial, they cannot help but attain actual existence.

From this comment on the second essential element in the historical embodiment of an aim, we infer – considering for a moment the institution of the state – that a state is then well constituted and internally vigorous when the private interest of its citizens is one with the common interest of the state, and the one finds gratification and realization in the other – a most important proposition. But in a state many institutions are necessary – inventions, appropriate arrangements, accompanied by long intellectual struggles in order to find out what is really appropriate, as well as struggles with private interests and passions, which must be harmonized in difficult and tedious discipline. When a state reaches this harmony, it has reached the period of its bloom, its excellence, its power and prosperity. But world history does not begin with any conscious aim, as do the _particular_ circles of men. Already the simple instinct of living together contains the conscious purpose of securing life and property; once this primal society has been established, the purpose expands. But world history begins its _general_ aim – to realize the idea of Spirit – only in an implicit form (_an sich_), namely, as Nature – as an innermost, unconscious instinct. And the whole business of history, as already observed, is to bring it into consciousness. Thus, appearing in the form of nature, of natural will, what we have called the subjective side is immediate, – actual existence (_für sich_): need, instinct, passion, private interest, even opinion and subjective representation. These vast congeries of volitions, interests, and activities constitute the tools and means of the World Spirit for attaining its purpose, bringing it to consciousness, and realizing it. And this purpose is none other than finding itself – coming to itself – and contemplating itself in concrete actuality. But one may indeed question whether those manifestations of vitality on the part of individuals and peoples in which they seek and satisfy their own purposes are, at the same time, the means and tools of a higher and broader purpose of which they know nothing, which they realize unconsciously. This purpose has been questioned, and in every variety of form denied, decried, and denounced as mere dreaming and “philosophy.” On this point, however, I announced my view at the very outset, and asserted our hypothesis – which eventually will appear as the result of our investigation – namely, that Reason governs the world and has consequently governed its history. In relation to this Reason, which is universal and substantial, in and for itself, all else is subordinate, subservient, and the means for its actualization. Moreover, this Reason is immanent in historical existence and reaches its own perfection in and through this existence. The union of the abstract universal, existing in and for itself, with the particular or subjective, and the fact that this union alone constitutes truth are a matter of speculative philosophy which, in this general form, is treated in logic. But in its historical development [_the subjective side, consciousness, is not yet able to know what is_] the abstract final aim of history, the idea of Spirit, for it is then itself in process and incomplete. The idea of Spirit is not yet its distinct object of desire and interest. Thus desire is still unconscious of its purpose; yet it already exists in the particular purposes and realizes itself through them. The problem concerning the union of the general and the subjective may also be raised under the form of the union of freedom and necessity. We consider the immanent development of the Spirit, existing in and for itself, as necessary, while we refer to freedom the interests contained in men’s conscious volitions. Since, as was said, the speculative, that is, the conceptual aspect of this connection belongs to logic, it would be out of place to analyze it here. But the chief and cardinal points may be mentioned.

In philosophy we show that the Idea proceeds to its infinite antithesis. ...

The Idea has within itself the determination of its self-consciousness, of activity. Thus it is God’s own eternal life, as it was, so to speak, before the creation of the world, (the) logical connection (of all things). It still lacks at this point the form of being which is actuality. It still is the universal, the immanent, the represented. The second stage begins when the Idea satisfies the contrast which originally is only ideally in it and posits the difference between itself in its free universal mode, in which it remains within itself, and itself as purely abstract reflection in itself. In thus stepping over to one side (in order to be object of reflection) the Idea sets the other side as formal actuality (_Fürsichsein_), as formal freedom, as abstract unity of self-consciousness, as infinite reflection in itself, and as infinite negativity (antithesis). Thus it becomes Ego, which, as an atom (indivisible), opposes itself to all content and thus is the most complete antithesis – the antithesis, namely, of the whole plenitude of the Idea. The absolute Idea is thus, on the one hand, substantial fullness of content and, on the other hand, abstract free volition. God and universe have separated, and set each other as opposites. Consciousness, the Ego, has a being such that the other (everything else) is for it (its object). In developing this train of thought one arrives at the creation of free spirits, the world, and so on. The absolute antithesis, the atom (i.e., the Ego), which at the same time is a manifold (of contents of consciousness), is finiteness itself. It is for itself (in actuality) merely exclusion of its antithesis (the absolute Idea). It is its limit and barrier. Thus it is the Absolute itself become finite. Reflection in itself, individual self-consciousness, is the antithesis of the absolute Idea and hence the Idea in absolute finiteness. This finitude, the acme of freedom, this formal knowledge when referred to the glory of God as to the absolute Idea which recognizes what ought to be – is the soil on which the spiritual element of knowledge as such is falling; thus it constitutes the absolute aspect of its actuality, though it remains merely formal.

To comprehend the absolute connection of this opposition is the profound task of metaphysics.

The Divine, and hence religion, exists for the Ego, and likewise also the world in general, that is, the universal totality of finite existence, exists for the Ego. The Ego, in this relation, is itself its own finiteness and comprehends itself as finite. Thus it is the viewpoint of finite purposes, of mere appearance. (At the same time it is particularity of consciousness.) Consciousness in itself, freedom abstractly considered, is the formal aspect of the activity of the absolute Idea. This self-consciousness, first of all, wills itself in general and, secondly, wills itself in every particular. This self-knowing subjectivity projects itself into all objectivity. This constitutes the Ego’s certainty of its own existence. Inasmuch as this subjectivity has no other content, it must be called the rational desire – just as piety is nothing but the desire for the subject’s salvation. The Ego thus wills itself primarily not as conscious but as finite in its immediacy. This is the sphere of its phenomenality. It wills itself in its particularity. At this point we find the passions, where individuality realizes its particularity. If it succeeds in thus realizing its finiteness, it doubles itself (its potential finiteness becomes actual finiteness). Through this reconciliation of the atom and its othernesses individuals are what we call happy, for happy is he who is in harmony with himself. One may contemplate history from the point of view of happiness.

But actually history is not the soil of happiness. The periods of happiness are blank pages in it.

There is, it is true, satisfaction in world history. But it is not the kind that is called happiness, for it is satisfaction of purposes that are above particular interests. Purposes that are relevant for world history must be grasped in abstract volition and with energy. The world-historical individuals who have pursued such purposes have satisfied themselves, it is true, but they did not want to be happy.

This element of abstract action is to be regarded as the bond, the middle term, between the universal Idea, which reposes in the inner recesses of Spirit, and the external world.

It is that which carries the Idea from its immanence into its external state. Universality, in being externalized, is at the same time made particular. The immanent by itself would be dead, abstract. Through action it becomes existent. Conversely, activity elevates (the) empty objectivity (of nature) to be the appearance of the essence which is in and for itself.

#### (b) The Individual As Subject of History

In world history we deal with the Idea as it manifests itself in the element of human will, of human freedom. ... Objectively seen, the Idea and the particular individual stand in the great opposition of Necessity and Freedom – the struggle of man against fate. But we take necessity not as the external necessity of fate, but as that of the divine Idea. The question then is: How is this high Idea to be united with human freedom? The will of the individual is free when it can posit abstractly, absolutely, and in and for itself that which it wills. How then can the universal, the rational in general, be determinant in history? This contradiction cannot be clarified here in complete detail. But think of the following:

The flame consumes the air; it is nourished by wood. The air is the sole condition for the growing of trees. In the wood’s endeavor to consume the air through fire, it fights against itself and against its own source. And yet oxygen continues in the air and the trees do not cease to grow green. So also when someone starts building a house, his decision to do so is freely made. But all the elements must help. And yet the house is being built to protect man against the elements. Hence the elements are here used against themselves. But the general law of nature is not disturbed thereby. The building of a house is, in the first instance, a subjective aim and design. On the other hand we have, as means, the several substances required for the work – iron, wood, stones. The elements are used in preparing this material: fire to melt the iron, wind to blow the fire, water to set wheels in motion in order to cut the wood, etc. The result is that the wind, which has helped to build the house, is shut out by the house; so also are the violence of rains and floods and the destructive powers of fire, so far as the house is made fire-proof. The stones and beams obey the law of gravity and press downwards so that the high walls are held up. Thus the elements are made use of in accordance with their nature and cooperate for a product by which they become constrained. In a similar way. the passions of men satisfy themselves; they develop themselves and their purposes in accordance with their natural destination and produce the edifice of human society. Thus they fortify a structure for law and order _against_ themselves. Thus the passions are by no means always opposed to morality but actualize the universal. As far as their own morality is concerned, it is true, they strive to realize their own interests. Thus they appear bad and self-seeking. But action is always individual; it is always I who act. It is my purpose which I want to fulfill. This purpose may be a good one, a universal aim; on the other hand, the interest may be a particular, a private one. This does not mean that it is necessarily opposed to the universal good. On the contrary, the universal must be actualized through the particular.

This connection implies that human actions in history produce additional results, beyond their immediate purpose and attainment, beyond their immediate knowledge and desire. They gratify their own interests; but something more is thereby accomplished, which is latent in the action though not present in their consciousness and not included in their design. An analogous example is offered in the case of a man who, thirsting for revenge perhaps justly to redress an unjust injury, sets fire to another man’s house. The deed immediately establishes a train of circumstances not directly connected with it, taken in itself. In itself it consists in merely presenting a small flame to a small portion of a beam. Events not involved in that simple act follow of themselves. The part of the beam which was set afire is connected with its remote portions; the beam itself is united with the woodwork of the house and this with other houses, and a wide conflagration ensues. It destroys the goods and chattels of many other persons besides those of the original victim and may even cost their lives. This lay neither in the deed itself, nor in the design of the man who committed it. But the action has a further general bearing. In the design of the doer it was only revenge executed against an individual through the destruction of his property. But it is moreover a crime, and that involves punishment. All this may not have been present to the mind of the perpetrator, still less in his intention; but his deed itself, the general principles that it calls into play, its substantial content, entail it. By this example I wish only to impress on you the consideration that in a simple act something further may be implicated than lies in the intention and consciousness of the agent. The example before us involves, however, this additional consideration, that the substance of the act – consequently we may say the act itself – recoils upon the perpetrator, reacts upon him and destroys him.

This union of the two extremes – the embodiment of a general idea in immediate actuality and the elevation of a particularity into universal truth – comes about under the condition of the diversity and mutual indifference of the two extremes. The human agents have before them limited aims, special interests. But they are also intelligent, thinking beings. Their purposes are interwoven with general and essential considerations of law, the good, duty, etc. For mere desire, volition in its raw and savage form, falls outside the scene and sphere of world history. These general considerations, which at the same time form norms for directing purposes and actions, have a definite content. For such empty abstractions as “good for its own sake” have no place in living actuality.

If men are to act, they must not only intend the good but must know whether this or that particular course is good. What special course of action is good or not, right or wrong, is determined, for the ordinary circumstances of private life, by the laws and customs of a state. It is not too difficult to know them. It is part of the freedom in the state ... that no apportionment in castes determines to which business an individual should dedicate himself. The morality of the individual, then, consists in his fulfilling the duties of his social position. And it is an easy matter to know what these duties are; they are determined by this position. The substantial content of such a relationship, its rationale, is known. It is, precisely, what is called duty. To investigate the content of duty is un-necessary speculation; in the tendency to regard the moral as a difficult problem, we rather sense the desire to get rid of one’s duties. Each individual has his position; he knows, on the whole, what a lawful and honorable course of conduct is. To assert in ordinary private relations that it is difficult to choose the right and good, and to regard it as mark of an exalted morality to find difficulties and raise scruples on that score indicates an evil and perverse will. It indicates a will that seeks to evade obvious duties or, at least, a petty will that gives its mind too little to do. The mind, then, in idle reflection, busies itself with itself and indulges in moral smugness.

The essence of a moral relation lies in the substantial nature that duty indicates. Thus, the nature of the relation between children and parents simply lies in the duty to behave accordingly. Or, to mention a legal relationship, if I owe money to someone, I just have to act according to law and the nature of the relation and return the money. There is nothing problematic in all this. The basis of duty is the civil life: the individuals have their assigned business and hence their assigned duties. Their morality consists in acting accordingly. ...

But each individual is also the child of a people at a definite stage of its development. One cannot skip over the spirit of his people any more than one can skip over the earth. The earth is the center of gravity; a body imagined as leaving this center can only be imagined as exploding into the air. So it is with an individual. But only through his own effort can he be in harmony with his substance; he must bring the will demanded by his people to his own consciousness, to articulation. The individual does not invent his own content; he is what he is by acting out the universal as his own content.

This universal content everyone must activate within himself. Through this activity he maintains the whole of ethical life. But there is another element active in history which does bring about just this difficulty of acting according to ethical norms. We saw earlier, in the discussion of the dialectic of the Idea, where this universal content originates. It cannot originate within the ethical community. There particular events may occur that violate its determinate universality, such as vice, fraud, and the like, which are suppressed. But a moral whole, as such, is limited. It must have above it a higher universality, which makes it disunited in itself. The transition from one spiritual pattern to the next is just this, that the former moral whole, in itself a universal, through being thought (in terms of the higher universal), is abolished as a particular. The later universal, so to speak, the next higher genus of the preceding species, is potentially but not yet actually present in the preceding one. This makes all existing reality unstable and disunited.

In the course of history two factors are important. One is the preservation of a people, a state, of the well-ordered spheres of life. This is the activity of individuals participating in the common effort and helping to bring about its particular manifestations. It is the preservation of ethical life. The other important factor, however, is the decline of a state. The existence of a national spirit is broken when it has used up and exhausted itself. World history, the World Spirit, continues on its course. We cannot deal here with the position of the individuals within the moral whole and their moral conduct and duty. We are concerned with the Spirit’s development, its progression and ascent to an ever higher concept of itself. But this development is connected with the degradation, destruction, annihilation of the preceding mode of actuality which the concept of the Spirit had evolved. This is the result, on the one hand, of the inner development of the Idea and, on the other, of the activity of individuals, who are its agents and bring about its actualization. It is at this point that appear those momentous collisions between existing, acknowledged duties, laws, and rights and those possibilities which are adverse to this system, violate it, and even destroy its foundations and existence. Their tenor may nevertheless seem good, on the whole advantageous – yes, even indispensable and necessary. These possibilities now become historical fact; they involve a universal of an order different from that upon which depends the permanence of a people or a state. This universal is an essential phase in the development of the creating Idea, of truth striving and urging toward itself. The historical men, _world-historical individuals,_ are those who grasp just such a higher universal, make it their own purpose, and realize this purpose in accordance with the higher law of the spirit.

Caesar was such a man. Before reaching his position of superiority he was in danger of losing his place of equality with the other leaders of Rome. He was about to succumb to those who were just becoming his enemies. These enemies, who at the same time pursued their own personal interests, had on their side the formal constitution of Rome and the power of legal appearance. Caesar fought to keep his position, honor, and safety. But victory over his enemies, who held the power over all the Roman provinces, became at the same time conquest of the entire empire. Thus Caesar, without changing the form of the constitution, became the sole ruler of the state. In accomplishing his originally negative purpose – the autocracy over Rome – he at the same time fulfilled the necessary historical destiny of Rome and the world. Thus he was motivated not only by his own private interest, but acted instinctively to bring to pass that which the times required. It is the same with all great historical individuals: their own particular purposes contain the substantial will of the World Spirit. They must be called “heroes,” insofar as they have derived their purpose and vocation not from the calm, regular course of things, sanctioned by the existing order, but from a secret source whose content is still hidden and has not yet broken through into existence. The source of their actions is the inner spirit, still hidden beneath the surface but already knocking against the outer world as against a shell, in order, finally, to burst forth and break it into pieces; for it is a kernel different from that which belongs to the shell. They are men, therefore, who appear to draw the impulses of their lives from themselves. Their deeds have produced a condition of things and a complex of historical relations that appear to be their own interest and their own work.

Such individuals have no consciousness of the Idea as such. They are practical and political men. But at the same time they are thinkers with insight into what is needed and timely. They see the very truth of their age and their world, the next genus, so to speak, which is already formed in the womb of time. It is theirs to know this new universal, the necessary next stage of their world, to make it their own aim and put all their energy into it. The world-historical persons, the heroes of their age, must therefore be recognized as its seers – their words and deeds are the best of the age. Great men have worked for their own satisfaction and not that of others. Whatever prudent designs and well-meant counsels they might have gotten from others would have been limited and inappropriate under the circumstances. For it is they who knew best and from whom the others eventually learned and with whom they agreed or, at least, complied. For Spirit, in taking this new historical step, is the _innermost soul_ of all individuals – but in a state of unconsciousness, which the great men arouse to consciousness. For this reason their fellow men follow these soul-leaders, _they stream to their banner_. For they feel the irresistible power of their own spirit embodied in them.

Let us now cast a look at the fate of these world-historical individuals. They were fortunate in being the agents of a purpose which constitutes a step in the progress of the universal Spirit. But as individuals distinguished from their substantial aim, they were not what is commonly called happy, nor did they want to be. They wanted to achieve their aim, and they achieved it by their toil and labor. They succeeded in finding their satisfaction in bringing about their purpose, the universal purpose. With such a grand aim they had the boldness to challenge all the opinions of men. Thus they attained no calm enjoyment. Their whole life was labor and trouble, their whole being was in their passion. Once their objective is attained, they fall off like empty hulls from the kernel. They die early like Alexander, they are murdered like Caesar, transported to Saint Helena like Napoleon. This awful fact, that historical men were not what is called happy – for only private life in its manifold external circumstances can be “happy” – may serve as a consolation for those people who need it, the envious ones who cannot tolerate greatness and eminence. They strive to criticize the great and belittle greatness. Thus in modern times it has been demonstrated _ad nauseam_ that princes are generally unhappy on their thrones. For this reason one does not begrudge them their position and finds it tolerable that _they_ rather than oneself sit on the throne. The free man, however, is not envious, but gladly recognizes what is great and exalted and rejoices in its existence. ... But to such great men attaches a whole train of envy, which tries to demonstrate that their passion is a vice. One can indeed apply the term “passion” to the phenomenon of the great men and can judge them morally by saying that passion had driven them. They were indeed men of passion: they had the passion of their conviction and put their whole character, genius, and energy into it. Here, then, what is necessary in and for itself appears in the form of passion. These great men seem only to follow their passion and their arbitrary wills. But what they pursue is the universal; that alone is their pathos. The passion precisely has been the energy of their ego; without it they would not have been able to achieve anything.

In this way the purpose of passion and the purpose of the Idea are one and the same. Passion is the absolute unity of individual character and the universal. It is something almost animalic how the spirit in its subjective particularity here becomes identified with the Idea. ...

By fulfilling their own great purpose in accordance with the necessity of the universal Spirit, these world-historical men also satisfy themselves. These two things belong inseparably together: the cause and its hero. They must both be satisfied. ... It is psychological pedantry to make a separation and, by giving passion the name of addiction, to suspect the morality of these men. By saying they acted only from morbid craving, one presents the consequences of their actions as their purposes and degrades the actions themselves to means. Alexander of Macedon partly conquered Greece and then Asia; it is said, therefore, that he craved conquest, and as proof it is offered that he did things which resulted in fame. What schoolmaster has not demonstrated that Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar were driven by such passions and were, consequently, immoral? From which it immediately follows that he, the schoolmaster, is a better man than they because he has no such passions, and proves it by the fact that he has not conquered Asia nor vanquished Darius and porus, but enjoys life and allows others to enjoy it too. These psychologists are particularly fond of contemplating those peculiarities that belong to great historical figures as private persons. Man must eat and drink; he has relations with friends and acquaintances; he has emotions and fits of temper. “No man is a hero to his _valet de chambre,_” is a well-known proverb; I have added – and Goethe repeated it two years later – "but not because the former is no hero, but because the latter is a valet.” He takes off the hero’s boots, helps him into bed, knows that he prefers champagne, and the like. Historical personages fare badly in historical literature when served by such psychological valets. These attendants degrade them to their own level, or rather a few degrees below the level of their own morality, these exquisite discerners of spirits. Homer’s Thersites, who abuses the kings, is a standing figure for all times. Not in every age, it is true, does he get blows – that is, beating with a solid cudgel – as in the Homeric one. But his envy, his egotism, is the thorn that he has to carry in his flesh; and the undying worm that gnaws him is the tormenting thought that his excellent intentions and criticisms get absolutely no result in the world. One may be allowed a certain glee over Thersites’ fate.

A world-historical individual is not so sober as to adjust his ambition to circumstances; nor is he very considerate. He is devoted, come what may, to one purpose. Therefore such men may treat other great and even sacred interests inconsiderately – a conduct which indeed subjects them to moral reprehension. But so mighty a figure must trample down many an innocent flower, crush to pieces many things in its path.

#### (c) The Individual As Object of History

The special interest of passion is thus inseparable from the actualization of the universal; for the universal results from the particular and definite and its negation. The particular has its own role to play in world history; it is finite and must as such, perish. It is the particular which exhausts itself in the struggle and part of which is destroyed. But the universal results precisely from this struggle, from the destruction of the particular. It is not the general Idea that involves itself in opposition and combat and exposes itself to danger; it remains in the background, untouched and uninjured. This may be called the cunning of Reason – that it sets the passions to work for itself, while that through which it develops itself pays the penalty and suffers the loss. For it is the phenomenal which in part is negative, in part positive. The particular in most cases is too trifling as compared with the universal; the individuals are sacrificed and abandoned. The Idea pays the tribute of existence and transience, not out of its own funds but with the passions of the individuals.

We might find it tolerable that individuals, their purposes and gratifications, are thus sacrificed, their happiness abandoned to the realm of natural forces and hence of chance to which it belongs; and that individuals in general are regarded under the category of means. Yet there is one aspect of human individuality that we must refuse to take exclusively in this light even in relation to the highest, an element which is absolutely not subordinate but exists in individuals as essentially eternal and divine. I mean morality, ethics, religion. Already in discussing the role of individuals in the realization of the rational aim we said that the subjective element in them, their interests, cravings, and impulses, their views and judgments had an infinite right to be satisfied, although we regarded these as only the formal aspect of the process. In speaking of means we imagine, first of all, something external to the end which has no share in it. But actually even merely natural things, the most common lifeless objects used as means, must somehow be adapted to their purpose; they must have something in common with it. This bare external relation of mere means is the least relation human beings have to the rational purpose. In the very act of realizing it they make it the occasion of satisfying their personal desires, whose import is different from that purpose. Moreover, they share in the rational purpose itself and for that very reason are ends in themselves – not merely formally, as is the world of other living beings, whose individual life is essentially subordinate to that of man and is properly used up as an instrument. Men, on the contrary, are ends in themselves in regard to the content of the end. This defines those elements which we demand to be exempt from the category of means: morality, ethics, religion.

Man is an end in himself only by virtue of the divine in him – that which we designated at the outset as Reason, or, insofar as it has activity and power of self-determination, as Freedom. And we say – without entering at present into further discussion – that religiosity, morality, etc., have their foundation and source in it and are thus essentially exempt from external necessity and chance. [But we must not forget that here we speak of morality, religiosity, etc., only insofar as they exist in individuals, hence, subject to individual freedom. In this sense, that is,] to the extent of their freedom, individuals are responsible for the depravation and enfeeblement of morality and religion. This is the seal of the absolute and sublime destiny of man, that he knows what is good and what is evil, and that his destiny is his very ability to will either good or evil. In one word, he can be guilty – guilty not only of evil but of good, and not only concerning this or that particular matter and all that happens in and around him (_Sittlichkeit_), but also the good and evil attaching to his individual freedom (_Moralität_). The animal alone is truly innocent. It would, however, require an extensive explanation – as extensive as that of freedom itself – to avoid or refute all the misunderstandings which usually arise from the statement that the word “innocence” means ignorance of evil.

In contemplating the fate which virtue, morality, even piety have in history, we must not fall into the litany of lamentations that the good and pious often, or for the most part, fare ill in the world, while the evil and wicked prosper. By prosperity one may understand a variety of things – riches, outward honor, and the like. But in speaking of purpose in and for itself, the so-called prosperity or misfortune of this or that isolated individual cannot be regarded as an essential element in the rational order of the universe. With more reason than merely the happiness or fortunate circumstances of individuals we demand of the purpose of the world that good, moral, righteous purposes should find in and under it their satisfaction and security. What makes men morally discontented – a discontent on which they pride themselves – is that they do not find the present appropriate for the realization of aims which in their opinion are right and good – especially the ideals of political institutions of our time. They contrast things as they are with their ideal of things as they ought to be. In this case it is neither private interest nor passion that desires gratification, but reason, justice, liberty. In their name people demand their due and often are not merely discontent but rebellious against the condition of the world. To estimate such views and feelings one would have to examine the stubborn demands and dogmatic opinions in question. At no time as much as in our own have such general principles and notions been advanced with so much pretentiousness. At other times history seems to present itself as a struggle of passions. In our time, however, though passions are not wanting, history exhibits partly and predominantly a struggle of justifiable ideas and partly a struggle of passions and subjective interests under the mask of such higher pretensions. These pretensions, regarded as legitimate in the name of the supposed destiny of Reason, are thereby validated as absolute ends – in the same way as religion, morality, ethics.

As was said earlier, nothing is now more common than the complaint that the _ideals_ which imagination sets up are not actualized, that these glorious dreams are destroyed by cold actuality. These ideals, which in the voyage of life founder on the rocks of hard reality, may be merely subjective to begin with and belong to the peculiarity of an individual who regards himself as supremely wise. Such ideals do not belong here. For what an individual fancies for himself in his isolation cannot be the norm for universal reality. The universal law is not designed for individuals, as such, who indeed may find themselves very much the losers. But by the term “ideal” we also understand the ideal of Reason, of the good and true. Poets, like Schiller, have painted such ideals touchingly and with strong emotion, and with the deeply melancholy conviction that they could never be actualized. In affirming, on the contrary, that the universal Reason _does_ actualize itself, we have nothing to do with the empirical detail. For this can be better or worse; here chance and particularity have received authority to exercise their tremendous power. Much fault, therefore, might be found in phenomenal details. This subjective fault-finding is easy, particularly since it keeps in view only the detail and its deficiency, without understanding the universal Reason in it. In asserting good intentions for the welfare of the whole and exhibiting a semblance of goodheartedness, it can swagger about with great airs. It is easier to discover the deficiency in individuals, in states, and in Providence, than to see their real meaning. For in negative fault-finding one stands nobly and with proud mien above the matter, without penetrating into it and without comprehending its positive aspects. Age generally makes people more tolerant; youth is always discontented. For older people have a more mature judgment, which accepts even the bad, not out of mere indifference but because it has been more deeply taught by the grave experience of life. It has thus been led to the essence, the intrinsic value of the matter in question.

The insight then to which – in opposition to these ideals philosophy should lead us is that the actual world is as it ought to be, that the truly good, the universal divine Reason is the power capable of actualizing itself. This good, this Reason, in its most concrete representation, is God. God governs the world. The actual working of His government, the carrying out of His plan is the history of the world. Philosophy strives to comprehend this plan, for only that which has been carried out according to it has reality; whatever does not accord with it is but worthless existence. Before the pure light of this divine Idea, which is no mere ideal, the illusion disappears as though the world were a crazy, inane process. Philosophy wishes to recognize the content, the reality of the divine Idea, and to justify the spurned actuality; for Reason is the comprehension of the divine work.

But then what about the atrophy, corruption, and ruin of religious, ethical, and moral purposes and social conditions in general? It must be said that essentially these purposes are infinite and eternal. But the forms that they assume may be of a limited order and consequently belong to the realm of mere nature, subject to the sway of chance. They are therefore transitory and exposed to atrophy and corruption. Religion and morality, as the universal essences in themselves, have the peculiarity of being present, conformably to their concepts and therefore truthfully, in the individual soul, although they may not be represented there fully elaborated and applied to completely developed conditions. The religiousness, the morality of a limited life – of a shepherd, a peasant – in their concentrated inward limitation to a few and quite simple circumstances of life, has infinite value. It has the same value as the religiousness and morality of a trained intellect and of an existence rich in scope of relations and activities. This inner focus, this simple region of the claims of subjective freedom – the seat of volition, resolution, and action, the abstract content of conscience, that wherein responsibility and worth of the individual are enclosed – remains untouched. It is quite shut out from the noisy din of world history, not only from its external and temporal changes but also from all alterations entailed by the absolute necessity of the concept of freedom itself. In general, however, it must be noted that for whatever in the world is acclaimed as noble and glorious there is something even higher. The claim of the World Spirit rises above all special claims.

So much concerning the means which the World Spirit uses for actualizing its concept. Simply and abstractedly, it is the activity of the subjects in whom Reason is present as their substantial essence in itself, but still obscure and concealed from them. The matter becomes more complicated and difficult when we regard the individuals not merely as active but, more concretely, consider. the definite content of their religion and morality – features which have part in Reason and thereby in its absolute claims. Here the relation of mere means to an end disappears. The main points of this seeming difficulty with regard to the absolute purpose of Spirit have been briefly considered.

### 3. The State

#### (a) The State As Realization of the Idea

The third point, then, concerns the end to be attained by these means, that is, the form it assumes in the realm of the actual. We have spoken of means; but the carrying out of a subjective, limited aim also requires a _material_ element, either already present or to be procured or to serve this actualization. Thus the question would arise: What is the material in which the final end of Reason is to be realized? It is first of all the subjective agent itself, human desires, subjectivity in general. In human knowledge and volition, as its material basis, the rational attains existence. We have considered subjective volition with its purpose, namely, the truth of reality, insofar as moved by a great world – historical passion. As a subjective will in limited passions it is dependent; it can gratify its particular desires only within this dependence. But the subjective will has also a substantial life, a reality where it moves in the region of essential being and has the essential itself as the object of its existence. This essential being is the union of the subjective with the rational will; it is the moral whole, the _State._ It is that actuality in which the individual has and enjoys his freedom, but only as knowing, believing, and willing the universal. This must not be understood as if the subjective will of the individual attained its gratification and enjoyment through the common will and the latter were a means for it – as if the individual limited his freedom among the other individuals, so that this common limitation, the mutual constraint of all, might secure a small space of liberty for each. (This would only be negative freedom.) Rather, law, morality, the State, and they alone, are the positive reality and satisfaction of freedom. The caprice of the individual is not freedom. It is this caprice which is being limited, the license of particular desires.

The subjective will, passion, is the force which actualizes and realizes. The Idea is the interior; the State is the externally existing, genuinely moral life. It is the union of the universal and essential with the subjective will, and as such it is _Morality._ The individual who lives in this unity has a moral life, a value which consists in this substantiality alone.” Sophocles’ Antigone says: “The divine commands are not of yesterday nor of today; no, they have an infinite existence, and no one can say whence they came.” The laws of ethics are not accidental, but are rationality itself. It is the end of the State to make the substantial prevail and maintain itself in the actual doings of men and in their convictions. It is the absolute interest of Reason that this moral whole exist; and herein lies the justification and merit of heroes who have founded states, no matter how crude.

What counts in a state is the practice of acting according to a common will and adopting universal aims. Even in the crude state there is subjection of one will under another; but this does not mean that the individual does not have a will of his own. It means that his particular will has no validity. Whims, lusts are not valid. The particularity of the will is being renounced already in such crude political formations. What counts is the common will. In thus being suppressed

the individual will retires into itself. And this is the first condition necessary for the existence of the universal, the condition., namely, of knowledge, of thought-for it is thought that man has in common with the divine. It thus makes its appearance in the state. Only on this soil, that is, in the state, can art and religion exist. The objects of our considerations are peoples that have organized themselves rationally.] In world history only those peoples that form states can come to our notice. [One must not imagine that such organizations could appear on a desert island or in isolation. Although it is true that all great men have formed themselves in solitude, they have done so only by assimilating what the state had already created. The universal must be not only something which the individual merely intends, but which is in existence. As such it is present in the state; it is that which is valid in it. Here inwardness is at the same time actuality. It is but actuality of an external manifold, yet comprehended here in universality.

The universal Idea manifests itself in the state. The term “manifestation” has here a meaning different from the usual one. Usually we distinguish between power (potentiality) and manifestation, as if the former were the essential, the latter the unessential or external. But no concrete determination lies as yet in the category of power itself, while where Spirit is, or the concrete concept, manifestation itself is the essential. The criterion of Spirit is its action, its active essence. Man is his own action, the sequence of his actions, that into which he has been making himself. Thus Spirit is essentially Energy; and in regard to Spirit one cannot set aside its manifestation. The manifestation of Spirit is its actual self-determination, and this is the element of its concrete nature. Spirit which does not determine itself is an abstraction of the intellect. The manifestation of Spirit is its self-determination, and it is this manifestation that we have to investigate in the form of states and individuals.

The spiritual individual, the people, insofar as it is organized in itself, an organic whole, is what we call the State. This designation is ambiguous in that by “state” and “constitutional law” one usually means the simple political aspect, as distinct from religion, science, and art. But when we speak of the manifestation of the spiritual we understand the term “state” in a more comprehensive sense, similar to the term _Reich_ (empire, realm). For us, then, _a people is primarily a spiritual individual_. We do not emphasize the external aspects but concentrate on what has been called the spirit of a people. We mean its consciousness of itself, of its own truth, its own essence, the spiritual powers which live and rule in it. The universal which manifests itself in the State and is known in it – the form under which everything that is, is subsumed – is that which constitutes the culture of a nation. The definite content which receives this universal form and is contained in the concrete actuality of the state is the spirit of the people. The actual state is animated by this spirit in all its particular affairs, wars, institutions, etc. This spiritual content is something definite, firm, solid, completely exempt from caprice, the particularities, the whims of individuality, of chance. That which is subject to the latter is not the nature of the people: it is like the dust playing over a city or a field, which does not essentially transform it. This spiritual content then constitutes the essence of the individual as well as that of the people. It is the holy bond that ties the men, the spirits together. It is one life in all, a grand object, a great purpose and content on which depend all individual happiness and all private decisions. The state does not exist for the citizens; on the contrary, one could say that the state is the end and they are its means. But the means-end relation is not fitting here. For the state is not the abstract confronting the citizens; they are parts of it, like members of an organic body, where no member is end and none is means. It is the realization of Freedom, of the absolute, final purpose, and exists for its own sake. All the value man has, all spiritual reality, he has only through the state. For his spiritual reality is the knowing presence to him of his own essence, of rationality, of its objective, immediate actuality present in and for him. Only thus is he truly a consciousness, only thus does he partake in morality, in the legal and moral life of the state. For the True is the unity of the universal and particular will. And the universal in the state is in its laws, its universal and rational provisions. The state is the divine Idea as it exists on earth.

Thus the State is the definite object of world history proper. In it freedom achieves its objectivity and lives in the enjoyment of this objectivity. For law is the objectivity of Spirit; it is will in its true form. Only the will that obeys the law is free, for it obeys itself and, being in itself, is free. In so far as the state, our country, constitutes a community of existence, and as the subjective will of man subjects itself to the laws, the antithesis of freedom and necessity disappears. The rational, like the substantial, is necessary. We are free when we recognize it as law and follow it as the substance of our own being. The objective and the subjective will are then reconciled and form one and the same harmonious whole. For the ethos of the state is not of the moral, the reflective kind in which one’s own conviction rules supreme. This latter is rather the peculiarity of the modern world. The true and antique morality is rooted in the principle that everybody stands in his place of duty. An Athenian citizen did what was required of him, as it were from instinct. But if I reflect on the object of my activity, I must have the consciousness that my will counts. Morality, however, is the duty, the substantial law, the second nature, as it has been rightly called; for the first nature of man is his immediate, animalic existence.

#### (b) Law As Realization of Freedom

The detailed development of the state is the subject of legal philosophy. But it must be observed that in present-day theories various errors are current respecting the state, which pass for established truths and have become prejudices. We will mention only a few of them, particularly those which refer to the subject of history.

The first error that we encounter is the direct contradiction of our principle that the State is the realization of freedom: the view, namely, that man is free by nature but that in society and in the state, to which he necessarily belongs, he must limit this natural freedom. That man is free “by nature” is quite correct in the sense that he is free according to the very concept of man, that is, in his _destination_ only, as he is, in himself; the “nature” of a thing is indeed tantamount to its concept. But the view in question also introduces into the concept of man his immediate and natural way of _existence._ In this sense a state of nature is assumed in which man is imagined in the possession of his natural rights and the unlimited exercise and enjoyment of his freedom. This assumption is not presented as a historical fact; it would indeed be difficult, were the attempt seriously made, to detect any such condition anywhere, either in the present or the past. Primitive conditions can indeed be found, but they are marked by brute passions and acts of violence. Crude as they are, they are at the same time connected with social institutions which, to use the common expression, restrain freedom. The assumption (of the noble savage) is one of those nebulous images which theory produces, an idea which necessarily flows from that theory and to which it ascribes real existence without sufficient historical justification.

Such a state of nature is in theory exactly as we find it in practice. Freedom as the _ideal_ of the original state of nature does not _exist_ as original and natural. It must first be acquired and won; and that is possible only through an infinite process of the discipline of knowledge and will power. The state of nature, therefore, is rather the state of injustice, violence, untamed natural impulses, of inhuman deeds and emotions. There is, it is true, a limitation by society and the state, but it is a limitation of the brute emotions and rude instincts, as well as (in a more advanced stage of culture) of self-reflecting caprice and passion. This constraint is part of the process through which is first produced the consciousness of and the desire for freedom in its true, that is, rational and ideal form.

The idea of freedom necessarily implies law and morality. These are in and for themselves universal essences, objects, and aims, to be discovered only by the activity of thought, emancipating itself from, and developing itself in opposition to, the merely sensuous; it must be assimilated to and incorporated with the originally sensuous will against its natural inclination. The perpetual misunderstanding of freedom is this: that one knows it only in its formal subjective sense, abstracted from its essential objects and aims. Thus the limitation of impulse, desire, passion – pertaining merely to the particular individual as such – of caprice and willfulness, is taken as a limitation of freedom. On the contrary, such limitation is the very condition leading to liberation; and society and the state are the very conditions in which freedom is realized.

Secondly, there is another theory that objects to the development of morality into legal form. The patriarchal state is viewed, either in relation to the whole or to some branches (of the human family), as that condition in which, together with the legal element, the moral and emotional find their fulfillment. Hence justice, it is believed, can be truly carried out only through the union of its content with the moral and emotional elements. The basis of the patriarchal condition is the family relation. It develops as the first phase of conscious morality, to be followed by that of the state as its second phase. The patriarchal condition is one of transition, in which the family has already advanced to a race or people. The union, therefore, has already ceased to be simply a bond of love and confidence and has become one of service. To understand this transition we must first examine the ethical principle of the family. The family is a single person; its members have either, as parents, mutually surrendered their individuality – and consequently their legal relations to one another, as well as their particular interests and desires – or have not yet attained individuality, as children, who are at first in the merely natural condition already mentioned. They live therefore in a unity of feeling, love, confidence, and faith in each other. In love, the one individual has the consciousness of himself in the consciousness of the other; he lives selflessly. In this mutual self-renunciation each gains the life of the other, as well as his own which is one with the other. All other interests of life, its necessities and external concerns, education of the children, form a common purpose for the members of the family. The spirit of the family – the Penates – are as much one substantial being as the spirit of a people in the State. Morality in both cases consists in a feeling, a consciousness, and a will not of the individual personality and its interests but of the common personality, the interest of all members as such. But this unity is in the case of the family essentially one of feeling, remaining within the limits of the natural. The sacredness of the family relation should be respected in the highest degree by the state. Through it the state has as members individuals who are already, as such and in themselves, moral – for as mere persons they are not; and who, in uniting to form a state, bring with them the sound basis of a political edifice, the capacity of feeling one with a whole. But the expansion of the family to a patriarchal whole extends beyond the ties of blood relationship, the simple, natural basis of the state. Beyond that the individuals must acquire the status of personality. A detailed review of the patriarchal condition would lead us to the discussion of theocracy. The head of the patriarchal clan is also its priest. When the family is not yet distinct from civil society and the state, the separation of religion from it has not yet taken place either; and so much the less since its piety is itself (like religion) an inwardness of feeling.

#### (c) The Legal Foundation of the State (The Constitution)

We have discussed two aspects of freedom, the objective and the subjective. If freedom implies the consent of each individual, then of course only the subjective aspect is meant. From this principle follows as a, matter of course that no law is valid except by agreement of all. This implies that the majority decides; hence the minority must yield to the majority. But already Rousseau has remarked that this means the absence of freedom, for the will of the minority is disregarded. In the Polish diet all decisions had to be unanimous, and it was from this kind of freedom that the state perished. Moreover, it is a dangerous and false presupposition that the people alone has reason and insight and knows what is right; for each popular faction can set itself up as the people. What constitutes the state is a matter of trained intelligence, not a matter of “the people.”

If the principle of individual will and consent of all is laid down as the only basis of constitutional freedom, then actually there is no _Constitution._ The only institution necessary would be a neutral, centrally located observer who would announce what in his opinion were the needs of the state, a mechanism of assembling the individuals, casting their vote, and the arithmetical counting and comparison of the votes on the various propositions – and this would already be the decision. The state is an abstract entity which has its – merely general – reality in the citizens. But it is real, and the merely general existence must be translated into individual will and activity. Thus arises the necessity of government and administration, the selection of individuals who have to take the helm of political administration, decide its execution, and command the citizens entrusted with it. Thus, even in a democracy the people’s decision on a war requires a general as leader of the army. Only in the constitution does the abstract entity of the state assume life and reality; but this involves a distinction between those who command and those who obey. Yet, it does not seem to be in accordance with freedom to obey, and those who command seem to act in opposition to the concept of freedom, the very basis of the state.

Thus the distinction between commanding and obeying seems necessary for the very function of the state. Hence one recommends – as a matter of purely external necessity, which is in opposition to the nature of freedom in its abstract aspect separated and considered by itself alone. Nor can this constitution be considered, discussed, and selected in isolation. Not only is the constitution intimately connected with those other spiritual forces and dependent on them, but the determination of the whole spiritual individuality, _including all_ its forces, is only a moment in the history of the whole and predetermined in its course. It is this that gives to the constitution its highest sanction and necessity. The origin of the state is domination on the one hand, instinctive obedience on the other. But obedience and force, fear of a ruler, is already a connection of wills. Already in primitive states we found that the will of the individual does not count, that particularity is renounced and the universal will is the essential. This unity of the universal and the particular is the Idea itself, present as the State and as such developing itself further. The abstract but necessary course of the development of truly independent states begins then with royal power, either patriarchal or military. After that, individuality and particularity must assert themselves in aristocracy and democracy. The end is the subjection of this particularity under one power which must be absolutely of such a nature that the two spheres have their independence outside of it: it must be monarchical. Thus we must distinguish a first (or original) and a second phase of royalty. This course is a necessary one; each concrete constitution must enter it. A constitution is therefore not a matter of choice but depends on the stage of the people’s spiritual development.

What is important in a constitution is the internal development of the rational, that is, the political condition, the setting free of the successive moments of the concept. The particular powers must become distinct, each one completing itself, but at the same time they must freely cooperate for one purpose and be held together by it, thus forming an organic whole. Thus the State is rational and self-conscious freedom, objectively knowing itself. For its objectivity resides precisely in the fact that its moments are not merely ideally present but actualized in their particularity; that they pass over from their own self-related activity into that activity from which results the whole, the soul, the individual unity.

The State is the idea of Spirit in the externality of human will and its freedom. It therefore is essentially the medium of historical change, and the stages of the Idea represent in it various _principles._ The constitutions wherein world-historical peoples have reached their flowering are peculiar to them, hence give us no universally valid basis. Their differences consist not in the individual manners of elaboration and development, but rather in the differences of principles. Thus we can learn little for the political principle of our time, as the last constitutional principle, from a comparison with the constitutions of earlier world-historical peoples. It is different with science and art. The philosophy of the ancients, for example, is so much the basis of modern philosophy that it must be contained in the latter as its fundament. The relation is here one of uninterrupted development of an identical structure, whose foundations, walls, and roof are still the same. In art that of the Greeks is the highest model. But in respect to the constitution it is different; here the old and the new do – not have the essential principle in common, although we do have in common abstract speculations and doctrines of just government, of insight and virtue of the ruler. Yet, nothing is so inappropriate as to use as models for our constitutional institutions examples from Greece, Rome, or the Orient. From the Orient we can take agreeable pictures of patriarchal conditions, fatherly government, popular devotion; from the Greeks and Romans descriptions of popular liberty. The Greeks and Romans understood the concept of a free constitution as granting all citizens a share in the council and decisions of communal affairs and laws. Also in our times this is the general opinion, – but with one modification: our states are so big and their people so many, that they cannot directly, but only indirectly through representatives, contribute their will to political decisions. For purposes of legislation the people must be represented by deputies. A free constitution is for us dependent upon the idea of representative government, and this has become a firm prejudice. Thus people and government are separated. But there is something malicious in this opposition, a trick of bad will, as if the people were the whole. Also, at the bottom of this idea lies the principle of individuality, the absoluteness of the subjective will of which we spoke above. The main thing is that freedom, as it is determined by the concept, is not based on the subjective will and caprice but on the understanding of the general will, and that the system of freedom is the free development of its stages. The subjective will is a purely formal concept which does not say at all what it wills. Only the rational will is the universal which determines and develops itself in itself and unfolds its successive moments in an organic manner. Of such Gothic cathedral architecture the ancients knew nothing.

#### (d) The Religious Foundation of the State

We have established as the two points of our discussion, first, the idea of Freedom as absolute final aim, and, secondly, the means of its realization, the subjective side of knowledge and volition with their vitality, mobility, and activity. We then discussed the State as the moral whole and the reality of freedom, and thus as the objective unity of the two preceding factors. Although for analysis we separated the two elements, it must be well remembered that they are closely connected and that this connection is within each of them when we examine them singly. On the one hand we recognized the Idea in its determination, as self-knowing and self-willing freedom which has only itself as its aim. As such, it is at the same time the simple idea of reason and likewise that which we have called subject, the consciousness of self, the Spirit existing in the world. On the other hand, in considering this subjectivity, we find that subjective knowing and willing are Thinking. But in thoughtful knowing and willing I will the universal object, the substance of actualized rationality (of what is in and for itself rational). We thus observe a union which is in itself, between the objective element, the concept, and the subjective element. The objective existence of this unity is the State. The State, thus, is the foundation and center of the other concrete aspects of national life, of art, law, morality, religion, science. All spiritual activity, then, has the aim of becoming conscious of this union, that is, of its freedom. Among the forms of these conscious unions religion is the highest. In it the spirit existing in the world becomes conscious of absolute Spirit. In this consciousness of actualized (“being-in-and-for-itself”) essence the will of man renounces, particular interest; it puts it aside in devotion in which he is not concerned any more with particulars. Through sacrifice man expresses his renunciation of property, his will, his private feelings. The religious concentration of the mind appears as emotion, but passes also into contemplation; ritual is an expression of contemplation. The second form of the spiritual union between the objective and the subjective is Art: it appears more in sensible reality than does religion; in its most noble attitude it has to represent, not indeed the spirit of God but the form of the God – and then the divine, the spiritual in general. It renders the divine visible to imagination and the senses. The True, however, not only achieves representation and feeling, as in religion, and for the senses, as in art, but also for the thinking spirit; this leads to the third form of the union, _Philosophy._ It is in this respect the highest, freest, and wisest product. We cannot here discuss these three forms in any detail. They had to be mentioned only because they occupy the same ground as the object of our study, the State.

The universal which appears and becomes known in the state, the form into which is cast all reality, constitutes what is generally called the _culture_ of a nation. The definite content, however, which receives the form of universality and is contained in the concrete reality of the State, is the spirit of _the people._ The true State is animated by this spirit in all its affairs, wars, institutions, etc. But man must himself know of this – his own – spirit and essence and give himself the consciousness of his original union with it. For we said that all morality is the unity of subjective and general will. The spirit, then, must give itself an express consciousness of this unity, and the center of this knowledge is religion. Art and science are only different aspects of this very same content.

In discussing religion it is important to ask whether it recognizes truth, or the Idea, only in its separation or in its true unity. In its separation: when God is conceived as the abstract highest Being, Lord of Heaven and Earth, transcending the world, beyond, and excluded from, human reality – or in its unity: God as unity of the universal and particular, in Whom even the particular is positively regarded, in the idea of incarnation. Religion is the sphere where a people gives itself the definition of what it regards as the True. Such a definition contains everything which belongs to the essence of the object, reducing its nature to a simple fundamental characteristic as focus for all other characteristics – the universal soul of all particulars. The idea of God thus is the general fundament of a people.

In this respect religion stands in closest connection with the principle of the State. Freedom can only exist where individuality is known as positive in the divine Being. There is a further connection between religion and the state: secular existence is temporal and moves within private interest. Hence it is relative and unjustified. Its justification can only be derived from the absolute justification of its universal soul, its principle. And this is justified only as determination and existence of the essence of God. For this reason the State is based on religion. We hear this often repeated in our time. But mostly nothing more is meant than that individuals should be pious in order to be more willing and prepared to do their duty; for obedience to prince and law is so easily connected with reverence toward God. It is true that reverence toward God, in elevating the universal over the particular, can turn against the particular in fanaticism, and work against the State, burning and destroying its buildings and institutions. Hence reverence for God, it is believed, should be temperate and kept in a certain degree of coolness, lest it storm against and destroy that which ought to be protected and preserved by it. The possibility of such disaster is at least latent in it.

The correct conviction that the State rests on religion may give religion a position which presupposes the existence of the State. Then, in order to preserve the State, religion must be carried into it, in buckets and bushels, in order to impress it upon people’s minds. It is quite correct that man must be educated to religion, but not as to something which does not yet exist. For, when we say that the State is based on religion and that it has its roots in it, we mean essentially that it has arisen from it and now and always continues to arise out of it. That is, the principles of the State must be regarded as valid in and for themselves, which they can only insofar as they are known to be determinations of divine nature itself.

The nature of its religion, therefore, determines that of the State and its constitution. It actually has originated from it: the Athenian and the Roman states were possible only through the specific paganism of these peoples, just as a Catholic state has a spirit and constitution different from a Protestant one.

It would be bad if this appeal, this urge and drive to implant religion, were a call of anguish and distress, as it looks so often – as if it expressed the danger that religion were about to disappear or already had disappeared from the State. Indeed, it would be worse than this appeal assumes; for it assumes it can still implant and inculcate religion as a means against this evil. But religion is not such an artifact. Its self-production is a much more profound process. Another and opposite folly which we meet in our time is the tendency to invent and institute constitutions independently from religion. The Catholic religion, although, like the Protestant, part of Christianity, does not concede to the State the inner justice and morality which follows from the inwardness of the Protestant principle.

This separation of constitutional law and of constitutions themselves from morality is necessary because of the peculiarity of that religion; it does not regard law and morality as independent and substantial. But thus torn away from inwardness, from the last sanctuary of conscience, from the quiet corner where religion has its abode, the constitutional principles and institutions lack a real center and remain abstract and indeterminate.

In summary, the vitality of the State in individuals is what we call Morality. The State, its laws, its institutions are the rights of the citizens; its nature, its soil, its mountains, air, and waters are their land, their country, their external property. The history of the State are their deeds, and what their ancestors have accomplished belongs to them and lives in their memory. Everything is their possession just as they are possessed by it, for it constitutes their substance and being.

Their minds are full of it and their wills are their willing of these laws and of their country. It is this temporal totality which is One Being, the spirit of One People. To it the individuals belong; each individual is the son of his people and, at the same time, insofar as his state is in development, the son of his age. No one remains behind it, no one can leap ahead of it. This spiritual being is his – he is one of its representatives – it is that from which he arises and wherein he stands. For the Athenians Athens had a double meaning, the totality of their institutions as well as the goddess which represented the spirit and the unity of the people.

This spirit of a people is a _definite_ spirit and, as was just said, is also determined according to the historical state of its development. This spirit, then, is the basis and content of the other forms of consciousness which have been mentioned. For the spirit in its consciousness of itself must be concrete to itself. Its objectivity immediately contains the origin of differences, which in their totality are the various spheres of the objective spirit itself – just as the soul exists only as the organization of its members which constitute it by combining themselves into simple unity. Thus it is one individuality. Its essence is represented, revered, and enjoyed as God, in religion; presented as image and intuition, in art; apprehended cognitively and conceived as thought, in philosophy. Because of the original identity of their substance, their content, and their subject matter with that of the State these products are inseparably united with the spirit of the State. Only with such a religion can there be such a form of the State, and only with such a State such art and such philosophy.

Furthermore, the definite national spirit itself is only one individual in the course of world history. For world history is the manifestation of the Divine, the absolute process of Spirit in its highest forms. It is this development wherein it achieves its truth and the consciousness of itself. The products of its stages are the world-historical national spirits, the definiteness of their moral life, their constitution, art, religion, and science. To realize these stages is the infinite élan of the World Spirit, its irresistible urge; for this differentiation and its realization constitute its concept. World history only shows how the World Spirit gradually attains the consciousness and willing of truth. Dawn rises in the Spirit; it discovers focal points; and finally, it attains full consciousness.

## IV. The Course of World History

### 1. The Principle of Development

We have now learned the abstract characteristics of the nature of Spirit, the means which it uses to realize its Idea, and the form which its complete realization assumes in external existence, namely, the State. All that remains for this introduction is to consider the _course of world history._

Historical change, seen abstractly, has long been understood generally as involving a progress toward the better, the more perfect. Change in nature, no matter how infinitely varied it is, shows only a cycle of constant repetition. In nature nothing new happens under the sun, and in this respect the multiform play of her products leads to boredom. One and the same permanent character continuously reappears, and all change reverts to it. Only the changes in the realm of Spirit create the novel. This characteristic of Spirit suggested to man a feature entirely different from that of nature – the desire toward _perfectibility._ This principle, which brings change itself under laws, has been badly received by religions such as the Catholic and also by states which desire as their true right to be static or at least stable. When the mutability of secular things, such as states, is conceded on principle, then religion, as religion of truth, is excluded. On the other hand, one leaves undecided whether changes, revolutions, and destructions of legitimate conditions are not due to accidents, blunders, and, in particular, the license and evil passions of men. Actually, perfectibility is something almost as undetermined as mutability in general; it is without aim and purpose and without a standard of change. The better, the more perfect toward which it is supposed to attain, is entirely undetermined.

The principle of _development_ implies further that it is based on an inner principle, a presupposed potentiality, which brings itself into existence. This formal determination is essentially the Spirit whose scene, property, and sphere of realization is world history. It does not flounder about in the external play of accidents. On the contrary, it is absolutely determined and firm against them. It uses them for its own purposes and dominates them. But development is also a property of organic natural objects. Their existence is not merely dependent, subject to external influences. It proceeds from an inner immutable principle, a simple essence, which first, exists as germ. From this simple existence it brings forth out of itself differentiations which connect it with other things. Thus it lives a life of continuous transformation. On the other hand, we may look at it from the opposite point of view and see in it the preservation of the organic principle and its form. Thus the organic individual produces itself; it makes itself actually into that which it is in itself (potentially). In the same way, Spirit is only that into which it makes itself, and it makes itself actually into that which it is in itself (potentially). The development of the organism proceeds in an immediate, direct (undialectic), unhindered manner. Nothing can interfere between the concept and its realization, the inherent nature of the germ and the adaptation of its existence to this nature. It is different with Spirit. The transition of its potentiality into actuality is mediated through consciousness and will. These are themselves first immersed in their immediate organic life; their first object and purpose is this natural existence as such. But the latter, through its animation by Spirit, becomes itself infinitely demanding, rich, and strong. Thus Spirit is at war with itself. It must overcome itself as its own enemy and formidable obstacle. Development, which in nature is a quiet unfolding, is in Spirit a hard, infinite struggle against itself. What Spirit wants is to attain its own concept. But it hides it from itself and is proud and full of enjoyment in this alienation from itself.

Historical development, therefore, is not the harmless and unopposed simple growth of organic life but hard, unwilling labor against itself. Furthermore, it is not mere formal self-development in general, but the production of an end of determined content. This end we have stated from the beginning: it is Spirit in its essence, the concept of freedom. This is the fundamental object and hence the leading principle of development. Through it the development receives meaning and significance – just as in Roman history Rome is the object and hence the guiding principle of the inquiry into past events. At the same time, however, the events arise out of this object and have meaning and content only with reference to it.

There are in world history several large periods which have passed away, apparently without further development. Their whole enormous gain of culture has been annihilated and, unfortunately, one had to start all over from the beginning in order to reach again one of the levels of culture which had been reached long ago – assisted, perhaps, by some ruins saved of old treasures – with a new, immeasurable effort of power and time, of crime and suffering. On the other hand, there are continuing developments, structures, and systems of culture in particular spheres, rich in kind and well-developed in every direction. The merely formal view of development can give preference neither to one course nor the other; nor can it account for the purpose of that decline of older periods. It must consider such events, and in particular such reversals, as external accidents. It can judge the relative advantages only according to indefinite viewpoints – viewpoints which are relative precisely because development _in general_ is viewed as the one and only purpose.

World history, then, represents the phases in the development of the principle whose _content is_ the consciousness of freedom. The analysis of its stages in general belongs to Logic. That of its particular, its concrete nature, belongs to the Philosophy of Spirit. Let us only repeat here that the first stage is the immersion of Spirit in natural life, the second its stepping out into the consciousness of its freedom. This first emancipation from nature is incomplete and partial; it issues. from immediate naturalness, still refers to it, and hence is still encumbered by it as one of its elements. The third stage is the rising out of this still particular form of freedom into pure universality of freedom, where the spiritual essence attains the consciousness and feeling of itself. These stages are the fundamental principles of the universal process. Each is again. within itself, a process of its own formation. But the detail of this inner dialectic of transition must be left to the sequel.

All we have to indicate here is that Spirit begins with its infinite possibility, but only its possibility. As such it contains its absolute content within itself, as its aim and goal, which it attains only as result of its activity. Then and only then has Spirit attained its reality. Thus, in existence, progress appears as an advance from the imperfect to the more perfect. But the former must not only be taken in abstraction as the merely imperfect, but as that which contains at the same time its own opposite, the so-called perfect, as germ, as urge within itself. In the same way, at least in thought, possibility points to something which shall become real; more precisely, the Aristotelian _dynamis is_ also _potentia,_ force and power. The imperfect, thus, as the opposite of itself in itself, is its own antithesis, which on the one hand exists, but, on the other, is annulled and resolved. It is the urge, the impulse of spiritual life in itself, to break through the hull of nature, of sensuousness, of its own self-alienation, and to attain the light of consciousness, namely, its own self.

### 2. The Origin of History

#### (a) The Pre-History of Reason

We have already discussed how the beginning of the history of Spirit must be understood in terms of the concept of freedom, when we referred to the “state of nature” in which freedom and justice would be, or have been, perfectly actualized.

This however was only an assumption, the assumption of an historical existence presented in the twilight of hypothesis. There is another assumption of an entirely different kind put into circulation today by certain parties, a pretension which is not presented as a theoretical hypothesis, but as an historical fact; and not only as an historical fact, but as a fact verified by higher sanction. This pretension takes up again the old notion of a primary, paradisical state of man, which the theologians had elaborated after their fashion by asserting, for example, that God had spoken with Adam in Hebrew. This is today revised in accordance with other interests. The higher authority in question is the Biblical account. But this account, on the one hand, represents the primitive conditions only through the few traits that are known. On the other hand, it either considers these traits as belonging to man in general, that is, to human nature as such; or it regards Adam as a particular individual and thus considers these primitive traits as belonging to one human person or to one human couple only. Yet these interpretations do not justify the opinion that a people has existed historically in such primitive conditions, and still less, that the pure knowledge of God and nature has been formed therein. Nature, so the fiction runs, originally stood open and transparent before the clear eye of man, as a bright mirror of divine creation, and the divine truth was equally open to him. It is even hinted – yet at the same time left in some degree of obscurity – that in this primary condition men had been in possession of an indefinite, already quite extensive knowledge of religious truths immediately revealed by God. From this supposedly historical condition, then, all religions are said to have taken their origin. But in the process, the original truth had been polluted and obscured by monstrous errors and perversions. Yet in all the mythologies invented by such error, traces of that origin and those first religious truths are supposed to be present and recognized. Investigations of the history of ancient peoples are therefore essentially interested in going back to a point where such fragments of first revealed insight are still to be found in greater purity.

We owe to this interest a great deal of valuable investigations. But this investigation immediately testifies against itself because it tends to verify as historical only that which it has presupposed as historical. Thus, world history is said to have had its origin in this knowledge of God or in scientific notions, such as astronomical knowledge allegedly possessed by the Hindus. From such beginnings, it is then held, the religions of the peoples had taken their traditional point of departure, but subsequently they had been perverted and degenerated, for example, in the crudely conceived so-called systems of emanation. All these are subjective, arbitrary assumptions, which neither have nor can have any historical justification in the light of the true conception of history.

Philosophical investigation can and ought to take up the study of history only where Reason begins to assume worldly existence, where consciousness, will, and action appear, and not where all this is still an unrealized possibility. The unorganic existence of Spirit, the still unconscious dullness – or, if you will, excellence – of freedom, of good and evil and thereby of laws, is not the object of history. The natural and at the same time religious morality is the piety of the _family._ Morality in this society consists in the very fact that its members behave toward each other not out of free will as individuals, not as persons. It is for this very reason that the family is still excluded from the development in which history takes its rise (it is pre-historical). Only when spiritual unity steps beyond this circle of feeling and natural love, and arrives at the consciousness of personality, does that obscure and rigid nucleus emerge in which neither nature nor spirit are open and transparent and where both can become open and transparent only through the further working of that self-conscious will and, indeed, through the long drawn-out cultural process, the goal of which is very remote. For consciousness alone is that which is open, that to which God and anything else can reveal itself. Nothing can reveal itself in its truth, in its concrete universality (for itself), unless there is a consciousness aware of itself. Freedom is nothing but the recognition and adoption of such universal substantial objects as Right and Law and the production of a reality which is in accordance with them – the State.

Peoples may have continued a long life before they reach their destination of becoming a state. They may even have attained considerable culture in certain directions. This _prehistory,_ according to what has been said, lies outside of our plan. Subsequently, these peoples may either have had a real history or never attained the formation of a state. During the last twenty-odd years a great discovery, as if of a new world, has been made in history, that of the Sanskrit language and its connection with the European languages. This has given us an insight into the connection of the Germanic and Indian peoples, a theory which carries as much certainty as such matters allow. Thus, at present we know quite certainly that there existed peoples which scarcely formed a society, let alone a state, but which nevertheless are known to have existed for a long time. Of others whose civilized condition interests us greatly the tradition reaches back beyond the history of the origin of their state. Much has happened to them before. This linguistic connection of so widely separated peoples shows as an irrefutable fact the spread of these peoples from Asia as a center and, at the same time, the disparate differentiation of an original kinship. This fact, fortunately, does not arise from the favorite method of combining and embellishing all kinds of circumstances, which has enriched and continues to enrich history with so many fictions presented as facts. Yet, this apparently so extensive range of events lies outside of history; it preceded it.

#### (b) The State as Condition of History

History combines in our language the objective as well as the subjective side. It means both the _historiam rerum gestarum_ and the _res gestas_ themselves, both the events and the narration of the events. (It means both _Geschehen_ and _Geschichte._) This connection of the two meanings must be regarded as highly significant and not merely accidental. We must hold that the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together. Family memories, patriarchal traditions have an interest confined to the family and the tribe. The uniform course of events under such conditions is not an object for memory. But distinctive events or turns of fortune may rouse Mnemosyne to form images of them, just as love and religious sentiments stimulate the imagination to give shape to an originally formless impulse. But it is the State which first presents subject matter that is not only appropriate for the prose of history but creates it together with itself. A community which acquires a stable existence and elevates itself into a state requires more than merely subjective mandates of government, sufficient only for the needs of the moment. It requires rules, laws, universal and universally valid norms. It thus produces a record of, and interest in, intelligent, definite, and in their effects lasting actions and events. To these, Mnemosyne, in order to perpetuate the formation and constitution of the State, is impelled to add duration by remembrance. Deeper sensitivity in general, like that of love and religious insight and its images, are in themselves complete, constantly present, and satisfying. But the state has (not only an internal but) – in rational laws and customs – at the same time an external existence. Thus its mere present state is incomplete; its complete understanding requires the consciousness of the past.

The periods, whether we suppose them to be centuries or millennia, which peoples have passed before the writing of history, may have been filled with revolutions, migrations, the wildest transformations. Yet, they are without objective history because they lack subjective history, records of history. Such records are lacking, not because they have accidentally disappeared during those long ages, but because they never could have existed.

Only in the state with the consciousness of laws are there clear actions, and is the consciousness of them clear enough to make the keeping of records possible and desired. It is striking to everyone who becomes acquainted with the treasures of Indian literature that that country, so rich in spiritual products of greatest profundity, has no history. In this it contrasts strikingly with China, which possesses such an excellent history going back to the oldest times. India not only has old books of religion and brilliant works of poetry but also old codes of law – which above were mentioned as a condition of the formation of history – and yet it has no history. In that country the impulse of organization, which begins to differentiate society, was immediately petrified into the natural distinctions of castes. The laws, thus, concern the civil rights, but make them dependent on these natural distinctions. They determine primarily mutual _prerogatives_ of the castes – wrongs rather than rights – namely, of the higher against the lower. Therewith the element of morality is banished from the splendor of Indian life and its empires. Because of that bondage of the caste system, in all historical relation there is wild arbitrariness, ephemeral bustling, indeed, raging without a final purpose of progress or development. Thus there is no thinking memory, no object present for Mnemosyne. A deep yet wild fantasy roams all over the ground; whereas, to create history, it would have needed a purpose within reality, belonging at the same time to substantial freedom.

#### (c) The Historical Role of Language

Due to such a condition of history this rich, indeed immeasurable growth of families into tribes, of tribes into nations, and their expansion due to this increase – a series of events which itself suggests so many complications, wars, rebellions, ruins – all this has merely happened without real history. What is more, the extension and organic growth of the realm of sounds connected with this process itself remained voiceless and dumb – a stealthy unnoticed advance. It is a fact of philological evidence that the languages that peoples have spoken in their rude conditions were highly elaborate; the understanding threw itself with great ingenuity and completeness into this theoretical task. A comprehensive, consistent grammar is the work of thought which reveals its categories in it. It is, moreover, a fact that with advancing social and political civilization this systematic product of intelligence is blunted, and language becomes poorer and less subtle. It is a strange phenomenon that the progress toward greater spiritualization and emphasized rationality should neglect this intelligent prolixity and expressiveness and actually find it cumbersome and dispensable. Language is the work of theoretical intelligence in the true sense; it is its external expression. Without language the exercises of memory and fantasy are immediate (non-speculative) manifestations. But this theoretical achievement in general and its further development, as well as the concrete fact connected with it – the spreading of peoples over the earth, their separations from one another, their comminglings and wanderings – all this remains veiled in the obscurity of a voiceless past. These are not acts of a will becoming conscious of itself, not acts of freedom giving itself phenomenal form and true reality. These peoples do not partake of the true element of history, in spite of their development of language. Therefore they have not attained historical existence. The premature growth of language and the progress and dispersion of nations gains significance and interest for concrete Reason only in either the contact with states or the autonomous formation of states.

### 3. The Course of Development

So much for the beginning of world history and the prehistorical periods to be excluded from it. We must now more closely examine the manner of its course, though here only formally. The concrete content will be dealt with in the main part.

#### (a) The Principle of a People

World history, as already shown, represents the development of the Spirit’s consciousness of freedom and the consequent realization of that freedom. This development implies a gradual progress, a series of ever more concrete differentiations, as involved in the concept of freedom. The logical and, even more, the dialectical nature of the concept in general, the necessity of its purely abstract self-development, is treated in Logic. There it is shown that it determines itself, posits its own determinations and in turn abolishes them (transcending itself), and by this very process of abolition and transcending gains an affirmative, ever richer and more concretely determined form. Here we have to adopt only one of its results: that each stage, being different from the other, has its definite, peculiar principle. Such a principle is in history the differentiation of Spirit; it is a particular national spirit. In this particular form a national spirit expresses concretely all the aspects of its will and consciousness, its whole reality. This principle defines the common features of its religion, its political constitution, its morality, its system of law, its mores, even its science, art, and technical skill. These special particularities must be understood in the light of the universal particularity, the special principle of a people. Conversely, that universal may be detected in the historically present factual detail of the particulars.

That the particular principle of a people is indeed a definite particularity is a point which must be empirically examined and historically proved. This presupposes not only a practiced faculty of abstraction, but also an intimate acquaintance with the Idea. One has to be familiar, so to speak, a priori, with the whole sphere of conceptions to which the principles belong, just as Kepler, to mention the greatest man in this mode of thinking, must have been acquainted a priori with ellipses, cubes, and squares and their relations. Only thus, by application of these mathematical concepts to the empirical data, was he able to invent his immortal laws, which consist in determinations of those concepts. He who is ignorant of the science embracing these elementary definitions can neither understand nor invent those laws, no matter how long he looks at the sky and the motions of the stars. This unfamiliarity with the Idea of the self-development of Freedom gives rise to some of the reproaches which are leveled against the philosophical treatment of a supposedly empirical science, in particular against the so-called a priori method and the introduction of ideas into the empirical data of history. Such ideas then appear as something foreign to the material. To a mind which lacks both knowledge and discipline of thought they certainly are foreign and beyond the conception which its ignorance forms of the object. Hence the statement that philosophy does not understand such sciences. Philosophy must indeed concede that it does not have the kind of understanding which rules in these sciences and does not proceed according to the categories of such understanding. Rather, it follows the categories of Reason. But these enable it to know not only this understanding but also its value and systematic position. It is equally necessary in this procedure of scientific understanding to separate the essential from the unessential and to bring both into relief against each other. To do so, however, one must know the essential; and the essential in world history, seen as a whole, is the consciousness of freedom and the realization of that consciousness in developing itself. The direction toward this category is the direction toward the truly essential.

Part of the arguments and objections raised against such a determination through universals arises usually through the lack of comprehension and understanding of ideas. If in natural history a monstrous or hybrid growth is brought forward as example against the tidy order of species and classes, then one can rightly apply what is often said vaguely, that the exception proves the rule – which is to say that it is up to the rule to demonstrate the condition under which it applies and to show up the deficiency, the hybridism, which lies in the deviation from the normal. Mere nature is too weak to keep its genera and species pure against conflicting elemental influences. If, e.g., on considering the human organization in its concrete aspect, we assert that brain, heart, and so forth are essential to its organic life, some miserable abortion may be adduced which has on the whole the human form or parts of it. It has been generated in a human body, has lived in it, and has breathed after birth, yet no brain and no heart is found in it. If such an instance is quoted against the general concept of a human being – the objector persisting in using the name coupled with a superficial idea of it – it can be proved that a real concrete human being is a truly different object. It must have a brain in its head, and a heart in its breast.

A similar mode of reasoning is used when it is rightly said that genius, talents, piety, moral virtues and sentiments appear in all zones, under all constitutions, and political conditions. There is an abundance of examples to confirm this. However, if such an assertion means to repudiate these distinctions as unimportant or unessential, then thinking stops at abstract categories and disregards any specific content – for which, it is true, no principle can be supplied by these categories. The viewpoint that adopts such merely formal perspectives presents a vast field for ingenious questions, erudite views, and striking comparisons, seemingly profound reflections and declamations, which can be the more brilliant, the more indefinite their subject is. Moreover, they can be renewed and varied again and again in inverse proportion to the certainty and rationality to be gained by their efforts. In this sense the well-known Indian epics can be compared with the Homeric and, taking vastness of imagination as proof of poetical genius, can be put above them. Or, one may find similarity in some fantastic features of Greek and Indian divinities and claim to recognize figures of Greek mythology in those of India. Again, the _One_ (Tao) in Chinese philosophy has been held to be the same as that which at later periods appeared in Eleatic philosophy to en kai tan and in the Spinozistic system (_Substance_)_._ Also, because it expresses itself in abstract numbers and lines, one has seen in it Pythagorean and Christian features. Instances of courage, persisting fortitude,

features of nobility, of self-denial and self-sacrifice, which are found among the most savage and the most pusillanimous nations, are regarded as sufficient proof that there is as much or even more morality and ethics in them as in the most civilized Christian states, and so on. On this ground, then, the doubt has been raised whether men in the progress of history and the development of culture have become better at all, whether their morality has increased – morality here being understood only as the subjective intention and insight of the agent, his own view of what is right or wrong, good or bad, and not as a principle which in and for itself is right and good, bad and evil, nor as a particular religion believed to be the true one.

We do not have to make evident the formalism and error of such a view, nor to establish the true principles of morality – or rather, establish ethics against false morality. For the history of the world moves on a higher level than that proper to morality. The locus of morality is private sentiment, individual conscience, particular will and mode of action. These have their own appropriate value, responsibility, reward, or punishment. The demands and accomplishments of the absolute and final aim of Spirit, the working of Providence, lie above the obligations, responsibilities, and liabilities which are incumbent on the individuals in regard to their morality. (An individual may for moral reasons resist and for immoral reasons advance the course of history.) Those who through moral steadfastness and noble sentiment have resisted the necessary progress of the Spirit stand higher in moral value than those whose crimes have been turned by a higher purpose into means of carrying on the will behind this purpose. But in revolutions of this kind both parties stand within the same circle of disaster. It is therefore only a formal right, forsaken both by the living spirit and by God, which the defenders of ancient right and order (no matter how moral) maintain. The deeds of the great men who are the individuals of world history thus appear justified not only in their intrinsic, unconscious significance but also from the point of view of world history. It is irrelevant and inappropriate from that point of view to raise moral claims against world-historical acts and agents. They stand outside of morality. The litany of the private virtues of modesty, humility, love, and charity must not be raised against them. World history (if it wanted to) could on principle altogether ignore the sphere of morality and its often mentioned difference with politics. It could not only refrain from moral judgments – its principles and the necessary relations of actions to them already are the judgment – but leave individuals entirely out of view and unmentioned. For what it has to record are the actions of the spirits of peoples. The individual forms which that spirit assumes in the sphere of external reality could be left to historiography in the narrow sense.

The same formalism which finds everything everywhere also plays around with vague ideas of genius, poetry, and philosophy, and finds them, too, everywhere alike. These ideas are products of a purely general reflection, which singles out and names essential distinctions, moving around with agility without going to the bottom of the matter. In this way we get _general culture – something_ merely formal which aims at nothing more than the analysis of a subject, whatever it may be, into its constituent elements and the comprehension of these elements through conceptual definitions and forms of thought. This is not the free universality which has to be made for itself an object of consciousness. Such consciousness of thought itself and of its forms isolated from all content is philosophy. The condition of its existence is indeed general culture, for its function is to invest the given content with the form of universality. Thus its possession involves both content and form in inseparable connection, so inseparable, indeed, that the content is regarded as purely empirical, without any admixture of thought. In this way analysis of an idea into a multitude of ideas enlarges the content itself to immeasurable richness. But it is quite as much an act of _thought,_ namely of the understanding, to make an object which in itself comprehends a rich concrete content into a simple idea and designate it by one name – such as, _Earth, Man,_ or Alex_ander and_ Caesar – as it is to analyze the Idea, isolate in thought the meanings it contains, and give them particular names. From all this follows that just as reflection brings forth the universal concepts of Genius, Talent, Art, _Science, so_ formal culture on every stage of intellectual development not only can but must prosper and reach a high bloom when it (reaches abstract, universal reflection. This it does when it) forms itself into a state. For on such a foundation civilization progresses to reflective understanding and abstract universality, not only in laws but in everything. In the life of the State as such lies the necessity of formal culture and therewith of the rise of sciences and of a finer poetry and art in general. Besides, the fine arts require even on the technical side the civilized association of men. Poetry is less in need of external necessities and tools and has as its material an element of immediate (natural) existence in the human voice. Hence it emerges with great vitality and fully developed already at a stage when a people has not yet attained unity through law. For, as was remarked earlier, language reaches a high development of thought before the beginning of civilization.

Philosophy, too, must make its appearance in the life of a state. For that process whereby a content becomes an element of culture is, as has just been shown, the form belonging to thought. Thus, philosophy, which is but the consciousness of that form itself, the thinking of thinking, receives the proper material for her own building already prepared from general culture. In the development of the State itself, periods must occur which impel the spirit of nobler natures to escape from the present into ideal regions, where they may find the reconciliation with themselves, which in the disintegrated real world they can no longer enjoy. During such periods the reflecting understanding attacks everything holy and deep which has been naively introduced into religion, laws, and customs. It flattens and dissipates it into abstract, godless generalities. Thus thinking is compelled to become thinking Reason in order to attempt in its own element the restoration from the ruin to which thought has been brought.

To be sure, we then find poetry, fine arts, science, and even philosophy in all world-historical peoples. But not only are style and direction different in general, but the content is even more different. And this content concerns the highest difference, that of rationality. (It is wrong to say that it is form, not content, that counts.) It is of no help when pretentious aesthetic criticism demands that the material, the substantial of the content, ought not to determine our aesthetic pleasure, but that beautiful form as such, or greatness of imagination and the like, is the aim of the arts; it is claimed that it is this which ought to be noticed and enjoyed by a liberal taste and cultivated mind. Sound common sense does not tolerate such abstractions and does not assimilate works of that kind. Granted that the Hindu epics might be placed side by side with the Homeric because of a great number of such formal properties – greatness of invention and imagination, liveliness of images and emotions, beauty of diction – there still remains the infinite difference of content, and hence the essential. There remains the interest of Reason which aims directly at the consciousness of the concept of freedom and its development in individuals. There is not only a classical form but also a classical subject-matter. Furthermore, content and form are so closely combined in a work of art that the former can be classical only as far as the latter is. With a fantastic content which does not limit itself intrinsically – and the reasonable is precisely that which has measure and purpose in itself – the form itself loses measure and form, or else (by contrast with the content) becomes petty and painfully narrow. In the comparison of the various philosophies, which we mentioned earlier, only one point of importance is being overlooked, namely, the _nature of_ that unity which is found alike in Chinese, Eleatic, and Spinozistic philosophy. Is this unity grasped as abstract or concrete and, if concrete, does this concreteness go to the point of being a unity in and for itself, a unity synonymous with Spirit? This equalization, however, proves that one recognizes a merely abstract unity. Thus, in judging about philosophy, one ignores that which constitutes the very interest of philosophy.

There are, however, also spheres which despite all the variety of cultural contents remain the same. This variety of cultures concerns thinking Reason, freedom whose self-consciousness Reason is and which springs from the same root as Thought. As it is not the animal but man alone who thinks, so also he alone has freedom – and only because he thinks. His consciousness makes the individual comprehend himself as a person, in his uniqueness as a universal in himself, capable of abstraction, of surrendering all particularity, hence understanding himself as inherently infinite. Spheres, therefore, that lie outside of this understanding (that is, are not individual) are common ground for these cultural differences. Even morals, which are so intimately connected with the consciousness of freedom, can be very pure even though this consciousness be still lacking. They then express only the general duties and rights as objective commandments, or stop at merely negative norms, such as the formal elevation of the soul, the surrender of sensuality and of all sensual motives. _Chinese_ morals gained highest praise and recognition from the Europeans as soon as this ethics and the writings of Confucius became known to them, and particularly by those who were familiar with Christian morals. Also the sublimity is recognized with which _Indian_ religion, philosophy, and poetry – that is, its higher form – express and demand the elimination and sacrifice of sensuality. However, these two nations, it must be said, lack completely the essential consciousness of the concept of freedom. To the Chinese their moral laws are like laws of nature – external, positive commands, compulsory rights and duties, or rules of politeness toward one another. The freedom is lacking through which alone the substantial determinations of Reason become moral conviction. Morals are a matter of the state and handled by officials of the government and the courts. Their treatises about it, which are not legal codes but addressed to the subjective will and disposition, read like the moral writings of the Stoics – a series of norms which are supposed to be necessary for the purpose of happiness; so that it is apparently up to the individual to take his stand toward them: he may or may not obey them. Indeed, it is the representation of an abstract subject, the sage, which for the Chinese as for the Stoic moralists is the culmination of such doctrines. Also in the Indian doctrine of renunciation of sensuality, of desires, and worldly interests, the aim and purpose are not affirmative moral freedom, but the annihilation of consciousness, spiritual and even physical inertia.

It is the concrete spirit of a people which we must concretely recognize. And because it is spirit, it can only be grasped spiritually, through thought. This is the spirit that sprouts forth in all deeds and tendencies of the people, that brings itself to actualization, to self-enjoyment, and self-knowledge. The highest achievement of the spirit, however, is self-knowledge, not only intuitive but rational cognizance of itself. This it must and also will achieve. But this achievement is at the same time its decline. It is the rise of another spirit, another world-historical people, another epoch of world history. This transition and connection of national spirits lead us to the connection of the whole, to the concept of world history as such, which we must now more closely examine and which we must understand.

#### (b) The Dialectic of National Principles

World history in general is the development of Spirit in _Time,_ just as nature is the development of the Idea in Space. When we cast a glance at world history in general, we see a tremendous picture of transformations and actions, an infinite of varied formations of peoples, states, individuals, in restless succession. Everything that can enter and interest the mind of man, every sentiment of goodness, beauty, greatness is called into play. Everywhere aims are adopted and pursued which we recognize, whose accomplishment we desire; we hope and fear for them. In all these events and accidents we see human activity and suffering in the foreground, everywhere something which is part and parcel of ourselves, and therefore everywhere our interest takes sides for or against. At times we are attracted by beauty, freedom, and richness, at others by energy, by which even vice knows how to make itself important. At other times we see the large mass of a universal interest move heavily along, only to be abandoned to and pulverized by an infinite complexity of trifling circumstances. Then again we see trivial results from gigantic expenditures of forces or tremendous results from seemingly insignificant causes. Everywhere the motliest throng which draws us into its circle; when the one disappears, the other swiftly takes its place.

This restless succession of individuals and peoples, who exist for a time and then disappear, presents to us a universal thought, a category: that of _change_ in general. To comprehend this change from its negative side, all we have to do is to look at the ruins of past splendor. What traveler has not been moved by the ruins of Carthage, Palmyra, Persepolis, Rome to think of the transitoriness of empires and men, to mourn the passing of once vigorous and flourishing life? This sadness does not dwell on personal loss and the transitoriness of one’s own purposes; it is disinterested sadness about the passing of splendid and highly developed human life. But then we pass on to another thought just as intimately connected with the idea of change, the positive fact, namely, that ruin is at the same time emergence of a new life, that out of life arises death, but out of death, life. This is a great thought which the Orientals fully understood and which is the highest thought of their metaphysics. In the conception of the migration of souls it refers to individuals. In the better known image of the _Phoenix,_ however, it refers to all natural life, continuously preparing its own pyre and consuming itself so that from its ashes the new, rejuvenated, fresh life continually arises. This picture, however, is Asiatic, oriental, not occidental. The Spirit, devouring its worldly envelope, not only passes into another envelope, not only arises rejuvenated from the ashes of its embodiment, but it emerges from them exalted, transfigured, a purer Spirit. It is true that it acts against itself, devours its own existence. But in so doing it elaborates upon this existence; its embodiment becomes material for its work to elevate itself to a new embodiment.

We must, then, consider the spirit in this respect. Its transformations are not merely rejuvenating transitions, returns to the same form. They are elaborations upon itself, by which it multiplies the material for its endeavors. Thus it experiments in a multitude of dimensions and directions, developing itself, exercising itself, enjoying itself in inexhaustible abundance. For each of its creations, satisfying for the moment, resents new material, a new challenge for further elaboration. The abstract thought of mere change gives place to the thought of Spirit manifesting, developing, and differentiating its powers in all the directions of its plenitude. What powers it possesses in itself we understand by the multiplicity of its products and formations. In this lust of activity it only deals with itself. Though involved with the conditions of nature, both inner and outer, it not only meets in them opposition and hindrance, but often failure and defeat through the complications into which it becomes involved through them or. through itself. But even when it perishes it does so in the course of its function and destiny, and even then it offers the spectacle of having proved itself as spiritual activity.

The very essence of spirit is _action._ It makes itself what it essentially is; it is its own product, its own work. Thus it becomes object of itself, thus it is presented to itself as an external existence. Likewise the spirit of a people: it is a definite spirit which builds itself up to an objective world. This world, then, stands and continues in its religion, its cult, its customs, its constitution and political laws, the whole scope of its institutions, its events and deeds. This is its work: this _one_ people! Peoples are what their deeds are. Every Englishman will say, we are the ones who navigate the ocean and dominate world commerce, who own East India and its wealth, who have a parliament, juries, and so on. The function of the individual is to appropriate to himself this substantial being, make it part of his character and capacity, and thus to become something in the world. For he finds the existence of the people as a ready-made, stable world, into which he must fit himself. The spirit of the people, then, enjoys and satisfies itself in its work, in its world.

The people is moral, virtuous, strong when it brings forth what it wills. It defends its product against outside powers through the work of its objectification. The tension between (its potentiality and its actuality) what it is in itself, subjectively, in its inner purpose and essence, and what it really is (objectively), is thus abolished. It is with itself (actualized), it has itself objectively before itself. But then this activity of spirit is no longer necessary; it has what it wanted. The people can still do a great deal in war and peace, internally and externally. But the living, substantial soul itself is, so to speak, no longer active. The deepest, highest interest thus has gone out of life; for interest is only where there is opposition. The people lives like an individual passing from manhood to old age, enjoying himself, for he is exactly what he wanted to be and was able to achieve. Even though his imagination may have gone further, it has abandoned more far-reaching purposes; if reality did not fit them, he fits the purposes to reality. It is this life of habit – the watch is wound up and goes by itself – which brings about natural death. Habit is tensionless activity. Only formal duration is left to it, in which plenitude and depth of purpose need no longer to be heard. Existence has become, so to speak, external, sensuous; it is not absorbed any more in its purpose. Thus individuals die, thus peoples die a natural death. Although the latter continue in existence, it is an uninterested, lifeless existence; its institutions are without necessity, just because the necessity has been satisfied – all political life is triviality and boredom. If a truly general interest is desired, then the spirit of the people would have to come to the point of wanting something new – but whence this something new? It would be a higher, more universal idea of itself, transcending its present principle; but this, precisely, would manifest the presence of a wider principle, a new spirit.

Such a new principle does indeed come into the spirit of a people which has arrived at its completion and actualization. It not merely dies a natural death, for it is no merely single individual, but has spiritual, universal life. Its natural death appears rather as the killing of itself by itself. The reason for this difference from the single, natural individual is that the national spirit exists as a genus, and consequently carries its own negation within itself, the very universality of its existence. A people can die a violent death only when it has become naturally dead in itself, such as the German Imperial Cities (_Reichsstädte_) or the German Imperial Constitution.

The universal spirit does not merely die a natural death; it does not simply vanish in the senile life of mere habit. Insofar as it is a national spirit and a part of world history itself, it also comes to know its work and to think itself. It is world-historical only insofar as in its fundamental elements, its essential purpose, there is a _universal_ principle; only insofar is the work which such a spirit produces a moral, political organization. If it is mere desires which impel peoples to actions, then such actions pass without leaving traces, or rather, its traces are mere corruption and ruin.

Thus at first Cronos ruled, Time itself – the golden age without moral works. What it produced, its children, were devoured by it. Only Zeus, who gave birth to Athene out of his head and whose circle included Apollo and the Muses, conquered Time and set a limit to its lapse. He is the political God, who has produced a moral work, the State.

In work itself is implied the elemental character of universality, of Thought, Without Thought it has no objectivity; thought is its fundamental definition. The highest point of a people’s development is the rational consciousness of its life and conditions, the scientific understanding of its laws, its system of justice, its morality. For in this unity (of subjective and objective) lies the most intimate unity in which Spirit can be with itself. The purpose of its work is to have itself as object. But Spirit can have itself as object only by thinking itself.

At this point, then, Spirit knows its principles, the universal element of its actions. But this work of Thought, being universal, is at the same time different in form from the particular, real work, and from the concrete life which brings the work about. When this point is attained, we have both a real and an ideal existence. If (for example) we want to gain a general representation and a concept of the Greeks and their life, we find it in Sophocles and Aristophanes, in Thucydides and Plato. In these individuals the Greek spirit grasped itself in thought and representation. This is its deeper satisfaction (its consummation); but it is at the same time ideal and different from its active reality.

In such a time, a people, therefore, necessarily finds a satisfaction in the idea of virtue. Talk about virtue partly accompanies, partly replaces real virtue. On the other hand, pure universal Thought, being universal, is apt to bring the particular and unreflected – faith, confidence, custom – to reflection about itself and its immediate (simple and unreflected) existence. It thus shows up the limitation of unreflected life, partly by giving it reasons on hand by which to secede from its duties, partly by asking about reasons and the connection with universal thought. Then, in not finding the latter, it tries to shatter duty itself as without foundation.

Therewith appears the isolation of the individuals from each other and the whole, their aggressive selfishness and vanity, their seeking of advantage and satisfaction at the expense of the whole. For the inward principle of such isolation (not only produces the content but) the _form_ of subjectivity – selfishness and corruption in the unbound passions and egotistic interests of men.

Thus Zeus and his race were themselves devoured, Zeus who set an end to the devouring action of Time and stayed this transiency by firmly establishing something lasting in itself. He was devoured by the generative agent, namely, the principle of Thought, of knowledge, of reasoning, of insight from and demand for reasons.

Time is the negative element in the sensuous world. Thought is the same negativity, but its deepest, its, infinite form. It therefore resolves all existence in general, but first in its finite, its definite form. For existence in general is determined as objective. It therefore appears as given and immediate, as authority. It is finite and limited either as content or (as form; the latter) as the bound for the thinking subject and its infinite reflection in itself.

The resolution of existence through thought is at the same time necessarily the arising of a new principle. Thought as universal is resolving, but this resolution actually contains the preceding principle within it, though no longer in its original form but transfigured through universality. Thus life emerges out of death; but it is only individual life. If we consider the genus as the substantial in this transformation, then the death of the individual is a falling back of the genus into individuality. The preservation of the genus is then nothing but the monotonous repetition of the same kind of existence.

Cognition, the thinking comprehension of being, is the source and birthplace of a new spiritual form, a higher form, whose principle is partly preserving, partly transfiguring its material. For Thought is the universal, the genus which is immortal and preserves its identity. The particular form of Spirit not only passes away naturally in time, but is abolished through the self-acting, self-mirroring activity of self-consciousness. Since this abolition is activity of Thought, it is both preservation and transfiguration. While thus Spirit, on the one hand, abolishes the actuality, the subsistence of what it is, on the other hand, it gains thereby the essence, the Thought, the universal of that which it _only was_ (of its transient condition) . Its principle is no longer this immediate content and purpose of what it previously was, but the essence of it.

The result of this process, then, is that the Spirit in objectifying itself and thinking its own being, on the one hand, destroys this (particular) determination of its own being and, on the other hand, grasps its universality. It thus gives a new determination to its principle. The substantial determination of this national spirit is therewith changed; its principle passes into a new and higher one.

It is most important for the full understanding and comprehension of history to grasp and possess the thought of this transition. An individual as unity traverses various stages and remains the same individual. So also a people, up to the stage which is the universal stage of its spirit. In this consists the inner, the conceptual necessity of its change. Here we have the essence, the very soul of the philosophical understanding of history.

Spirit is essentially the result of its own activity. Its activity is transcending the immediately given, negating it, and returning into itself. We can compare it with the seed of a plant, which is both beginning and result of the plant’s whole life. The powerlessness of life manifests itself precisely in this falling apart of beginning and end. Likewise in the lives of individuals and peoples. The life of a people brings a fruit to maturity, for its activity aims at actualizing its principle.

But the fruit does not fall back into the womb of the people which has produced and matured it. On the contrary, it turns into a bitter drink for this people. The people cannot abandon it, for it has an unquenchable thirst for it. But imbibing the drink is the drinker’s destruction, yet, at the same time the rise of a new principle.

We have already seen what the final purpose of this process is. The principles of the national spirits progressing through a necessary succession of stages are only moments of the one universal Spirit which through them elevates and completes itself into a self-comprehending _totality._

Thus, in dealing with the idea of Spirit only and in considering the whole of world history as nothing but its manifestation, we are dealing only with the _present – however long_ the past may be which we survey. There is no time where it (the Spirit) has not been nor will not be; it neither was nor is it yet to be. It is forever now. The Idea is ever present, the Spirit immortal. What is true is eternal in and for itself, neither yesterday nor tomorrow but now in the sense of absolute presence. In the Idea, what may seem lost is eternally preserved. This implies that the present stage of Spirit contains all previous stages within itself. These, to be sure, have unfolded themselves successively and separately, but Spirit still is what it has in itself always been. The differentiation of its stages is but the development of what it is in itself. The life of the ever-present Spirit is a cycle of stages, which, on the one hand, co-exist side by side, but, on the other hand, seem to be past. The moments which Spirit seems to have left behind, it still possesses in the depth of its present.

The Phenomenology of Mind

— B —  
Self Consciousness

# A: Independence and Dependence of Self-Consciousness:  
Lordship and Bondage

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p178) [178](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m178). SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS exists in itself and for itself, in that, and by the fact that it exists for another self-consciousness; that is to say, it _is_ only by being acknowledged or “recognized”. The conception of this its unity in its duplication, of infinitude realizing itself in self-consciousness, has many sides to it and encloses within it elements of varied significance. Thus its moments must on the one hand be strictly kept apart in detailed distinctiveness, and, on the other, in this distinction must, at the same time, also be taken as not distinguished, or must always be accepted and understood in their opposite sense. This double meaning of what is distinguished lies in the nature of self-consciousness: — of its being infinite, or directly the opposite of the determinateness in which it is fixed. The detailed exposition of the notion of this spiritual unity in its duplication will bring before us the process of Recognition.

### 1. Duplicated Self-Consciousness

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p179) [179](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m179). Self-consciousness has before it another self-consciousness; it has come outside itself. This has a double significance. First it has lost its own self, since it finds itself as an _other_ being; secondly, it has thereby sublated that other, for it does not regard the other as essentially real, but sees its own self in the other.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p180) [180](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m180). It must cancel this its other. To do so is the sublation of that first double meaning, and is therefore a second double meaning. First, it must set itself to sublate the other independent being, in order thereby to become certain of itself as true being, secondly, it thereupon proceeds to sublate its own self, for this other is itself.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p181) [181](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m181). This sublation in a double sense of its otherness in a double sense is at the same time a return in a double sense into its self. For, firstly, through sublation, it gets back itself, because it becomes one with itself again through the cancelling of _its_ otherness; but secondly, it likewise gives otherness back again to the other self-consciousness, for it was aware of being in the other, it cancels this its own being in the other and thus lets the other again go free.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p182) [182](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m182). This process of self-consciousness in relation to another self-consciousness has in this manner been represented as the action of one alone. But this action on the part of the one has itself the double significance of being at once its own action and the action of that other as well. For the other is likewise independent, shut up within itself, and there is nothing in it which is not there through itself. The first does not have the object before it only in the passive form characteristic primarily of the object of desire, but as an object existing independently for itself, over which therefore it has no power to do anything for its own behalf, if that object does not _per se_ do what the first does to it. The process then is absolutely the double process of both self-consciousnesses. Each sees the other do the same as itself; each itself does what it demands on the part of the other, and for that reason does what it does, only so far as the other does the same. Action from one side only would be useless, because what is to happen can only be brought about by means of both.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p183) [183](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m183). The action has then a _double entente_ not only in the sense that it is an act done to itself as well as to the other, but also in the sense that the act _simpliciter_ is the act of the one as well as of the other regardless of their distinction.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p184) [184](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m184). In this movement we see the process repeated which came before us as the play of forces; in the present case, however, it is found in consciousness. What in the former had effect only for us [contemplating experience], holds here for the terms themselves. The middle term is self-consciousness which breaks itself up into the extremes; and each extreme is this interchange of its own determinateness, and complete transition into the opposite. While _qua_ consciousness, it no doubt comes outside itself, still, in being outside itself, it is at the same time restrained within itself, it exists for itself, and its self-externalization is for consciousness. _Consciousness_ finds that it immediately is and is not another consciousness, as also that this other is for itself only when it cancels itself as existing for itself , and has self-existence only in the self-existence of the other. Each is the mediating term to the other, through which each mediates and unites itself with itself; and each is to itself and to the other an immediate self-existing reality, which, at the same time, exists thus for itself only through this mediation. They recognize themselves as mutually recognizing one another.

### 2. The Conflict of Self-Consciousness in Self-opposition

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p185) [185](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m185). This pure conception of recognition, of duplication of self-consciousness within its unity, we must now consider in the way its process appears for self-consciousness. It will, in the first place, present the aspect of the disparity of the two, or the break-up of the middle term into the extremes, which, _qua_ extremes, are opposed to one another, and of which one is merely recognized, while the other only recognizes.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p186) [186](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m186). Self-consciousness is primarily simple existence for self, self-identity by exclusion of every other from itself. It takes its essential nature and absolute object to be Ego; and in this immediacy, in this bare fact of its self-existence, it is individual. That which for it is other stands as unessential object, as object with the impress and character of negation. But the other is also a self-consciousness; an individual makes its appearance in antithesis to an individual. Appearing thus in their immediacy, they are for each other in the manner of ordinary objects. They are independent individual forms, modes of Consciousness that have not risen above the bare level of life (for the existent object here has been determined as life). They are, moreover, forms of consciousness which have not yet accomplished for one another the process of absolute abstraction, of uprooting all immediate existence, and of being merely the bare, negative fact of self-identical consciousness; or, in other words, have not yet revealed themselves to each other as existing purely for themselves, i.e., as self-consciousness. Each is indeed certain of its own self, but not of the other, and hence its own certainty of itself is still without truth. For its truth would be merely that its own individual existence for itself would be shown to it to be an independent object, or, which is the same thing, that the object would be exhibited as this pure certainty of itself. By the notion of recognition, however, this is not possible, except in the form that as the other is for it, so it is for the other; each in its self through its own action and again through the action of the other achieves this pure abstraction of existence for self.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p187) [187](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m187). The presentation of itself, however, as pure abstraction of self-consciousness consists in showing itself as a pure negation of its objective form, or in showing that it is fettered to no determinate existence, that it is not bound at all by the particularity everywhere characteristic of existence as such, and is _not_ tied up with life. The process of bringing all this out involves a twofold action — action on the part of the other and action on the part of itself. In so far as it is the other’s action, each aims at the destruction and death of the other. But in this there is implicated also the second kind of action, self-activity; for the former implies that it risks its own life. The relation of both self-consciousnesses is in this way so constituted that they prove themselves and each other through a life-and-death struggle. They must enter into this struggle, for they must bring their certainty of themselves, the certainty of being for themselves, to the level of objective truth, and make this a fact both in the case of the other and in their own case as well. And it is solely by risking life that freedom is obtained; only thus is it tried and proved that the essential nature of self-consciousness is not bare existence, is not the merely immediate form in which it at first makes its appearance, is not its mere absorption in the expanse of life. Rather it is thereby guaranteed that there is nothing present but what might be taken as a vanishing moment — that self-consciousness is merely pure self-existence, being-for-self. The individual, who has not staked his life, may, no doubt, be recognized as a Person; but he has not attained the truth of this recognition as an independent self-consciousness. In the same way each must aim at the death of the other, as it risks its own life thereby; for that other is to it of no more worth than itself; the other’s reality is presented to the former as an external other, as outside itself; it must cancel that externality. The other is a purely existent consciousness and entangled in manifold ways; it must view its otherness as pure existence for itself or as absolute negation.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p188) [188](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m188). This trial by death, however, cancels both the truth which was to result from it, and therewith the certainty of self altogether. For just as life is the natural “position” of consciousness, independence without absolute negativity, so death is the natural “negation” of consciousness, negation without independence, which thus remains without the requisite significance of actual recognition. Through death, doubtless, there has arisen the certainty that both did stake their life, and held it lightly both in their own case and in the case of the other; but that is not for those who underwent this struggle. They cancel their consciousness which had its place in this alien element of natural existence; in other words, they cancel themselves and are sublated as terms or extremes seeking to have existence on their own account. But along with this there vanishes from the play of change the essential moment, viz. that of breaking up into extremes with opposite characteristics; and the middle term collapses into a lifeless unity which is broken up into lifeless extremes, merely existent and not opposed. And the two do not mutually give and receive one another back from each other through consciousness; they let one another go quite indifferently, like things. Their act is abstract negation, not the negation characteristic of consciousness, which cancels in such a way that it preserves and maintains what is sublated, and thereby survives its being sublated.

### 3. Lord and Bondsman

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p189) [189](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m189). In this experience self-consciousness becomes aware that _life_ is as essential to it as pure self-consciousness. In immediate self-consciousness the simple ego is absolute object, which, however, is for us or in itself absolute mediation, and has as its essential moment substantial and solid independence. The dissolution of that simple unity is the result of the first experience; through this there is posited a pure self-consciousness, and a consciousness which is not purely for itself, but for another, i.e. as an existent consciousness, consciousness in the form and shape of thinghood. Both moments are essential, since, in the first instance, they are unlike and opposed, and their reflexion into unity has not yet come to light, they stand as two opposed forms or modes of consciousness. The one is independent, and its essential nature is to be for itself; the other is dependent, and its essence is life or existence for another. The former is the Master, or Lord, the latter the Bondsman.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p190) [190](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m190). The master is the consciousness that exists _for itself;_ but no longer merely the general notion of existence for self. Rather, it is a consciousness existing on its own account which is mediated with itself through an other consciousness, i.e. through an other whose very nature implies that it is bound up with an independent being or with thinghood in general. The master brings himself into relation to both these moments, to a thing as such, the object of desire, and to the consciousness whose essential character is thinghood. And since the master, is (_a_) _qua_ notion of self-consciousness, an immediate relation of self-existence, but (_b_) is now moreover at the same time mediation, or a being-for-self which is for itself only through an other — he [the master] stands in relation (_a_) immediately to both, (_b_) mediately to each through the other. The master relates himself to the bondsman mediately through independent existence, for that is precisely what keeps the bondsman in thrall; it is his chain, from which he could not in the struggle get away, and for that reason he proved himself to be dependent, to have his independence in the shape of thinghood. The master, however, is the power controlling this state of existence, for he has shown in the struggle that he holds it to be merely something negative. Since he is the power dominating existence, while this existence again is the power controlling the other [the bondsman], the master holds, _par consequence_, this other in subordination. In the same way the master relates himself to the thing mediately through the bondsman. The bondsman being a self-consciousness in the broad sense, also takes up a negative attitude to things and cancels them; but the thing is, at the same time, independent for him and, in consequence, he cannot, with all his negating, get so far as to annihilate it outright and be done with it; that is to say, he merely works on it. To the master, on the other hand, by means of this mediating process, belongs the immediate relation, in the sense of the pure negation of it, in other words he gets the enjoyment. What mere desire did not attain, he now succeeds in attaining, viz. to have done with the thing, and find satisfaction in enjoyment. Desire alone did not get the length of this, because of the independence of the thing. The master, however, who has interposed the bondsman between it and himself, thereby relates himself merely to the dependence of the thing, and enjoys it without qualification and without reserve. The aspect of its independence he leaves to the bondsman, who labours upon it.

#### (a). Lordship

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p191) [191](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m191). In these two moments, the master gets his recognition through an other consciousness, for in them the latter affirms itself as unessential, both by working upon the thing, and, on the other hand, by the fact of being dependent on a determinate existence; in neither case can this other get the mastery over existence, and succeed in absolutely negating it. We have thus here this moment of recognition, viz. that the other consciousness cancels itself as self-existent, and, _ipso facto,_ itself does what the first does to it. In the same way we have the other moment, that this action on the part of the second is the action proper of the first; for what is done by the bondsman is properly an action on the part of the master. The latter exists only for himself, that is his essential nature; he is the negative power without qualification, a power to which the thing is naught. And he is thus the absolutely essential act in this situation, while the bondsman is not so, he is an unessential activity. But for recognition proper there is needed the moment that what the master does to the other he should also do to himself, and what the bondsman does to himself, he should do to the other also. On that account a form of recognition has arisen that is one-sided and unequal.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p192) [192](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m192). In all this, the unessential consciousness is, for the master, the object which embodies the truth of his certainty of himself. But it is evident that this object does not correspond to its notion; for, just where the master has effectively achieved lordship, he really finds that something has come about quite different from an independent consciousness. It is not an independent, but rather a dependent consciousness that he has achieved. He is thus not assured of self-existence as his truth; he finds that his truth is rather the unessential consciousness, and the fortuitous unessential action of that consciousness.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p193) [193](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m193). The truth of the independent consciousness is accordingly the consciousness of the bondsman. This doubtless appears in the first instance outside itself, and not as the truth of self-consciousness. But just as lordship showed its essential nature to be the reverse of what it wants to be, so, too, bondage will, when completed, pass into the opposite of what it immediately is: being a consciousness repressed within itself, it will enter into itself, and change round into real and true independence.

#### (b). Fear

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p194) [194](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m194). We have seen what bondage is only in relation to lordship. But it is a self-consciousness, and we have now to consider what it is, in this regard, in and for itself. In the first instance, the master is taken to be the essential reality for the state of bondage; hence, for it, the truth is the independent consciousness existing for itself, although this truth is not taken yet as inherent in bondage itself. Still, it does in fact contain within itself this truth of pure negativity and self-existence, because it has experienced this reality within it. For this consciousness was not in peril and fear for this element or that, nor for this or that moment of time, it was afraid for its entire being; it felt the fear of death, the sovereign master. It has been in that experience melted to its inmost soul, has trembled throughout its every fibre, and all that was fixed and steadfast has quaked within it. This complete perturbation of its entire substance, this absolute dissolution of all its stability into fluent continuity, is, however, the simple, ultimate nature of self-consciousness, absolute negativity, pure self-referrent existence, which consequently is involved in this type of consciousness. This moment of pure self-existence is moreover a fact for it; for in the master it finds this as its object. Further, this bondsman’s consciousness is not only this total dissolution in a general way; in serving and toiling the bondsman actually carries this out. By serving he cancels in every particular aspect his dependence on and attachment to natural existence, and by his work removes this existence away.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p195) [195](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m195). The feeling of absolute power, however, realized both in general and in the particular form of service, is only dissolution implicitly; and albeit the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom, consciousness is not therein aware of being self-existent. Through work and labour, however, this consciousness of the bondsman comes to itself. In the moment which corresponds to desire in the case of the master’s consciousness, the aspect of the non-essential relation to the thing seemed to fall to the lot of the servant, since the thing there retained its independence. Desire has reserved to itself the pure negating of the object and thereby unalloyed feeling of self. This satisfaction, however, just for that reason is itself only a state of evanescence, for it lacks objectivity or subsistence. Labour, on the other hand, is desire restrained and checked, evanescence delayed and postponed; in other words, labour shapes and fashions the thing. The negative relation to the object passes into the form of the object, into something that is permanent and remains; because it is just for the labourer that the object has independence. This negative mediating agency, this activity giving shape and form, is at the same time the individual existence, the pure self-existence of that consciousness, which now in the work it does is externalized and passes into the condition of permanence. The consciousness that toils and serves accordingly attains by this means the direct apprehension of that independent being as its self.

[Φ](https://www.marxists.org/deutsch/philosophie/hegel/phaenom/kap4.htm#p196) [196](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/findlay2.htm#m196). But again, shaping or forming the object has not only the positive significance that the bondsman becomes thereby aware of himself as factually and objectively self-existent; this type of consciousness has also a negative import, in contrast with its moment, the element of fear. For in shaping the thing it only becomes aware of its own proper negativity, existence on its own account, as an object, through the fact that it cancels the actual form confronting it. But this objective negative element is precisely alien, external reality, before which it trembled. Now, however, it destroys this extraneous alien negative, affirms and sets itself up as a negative in the element of permanence, and thereby becomes for itself a self-existent being. In the master, the bondsman feels self-existence to be something external, an objective fact; in fear self-existence is present within himself; in fashioning the thing, self-existence comes to be felt explicitly as his own proper being, and he attains the consciousness that he himself exists in its own right and on its own account (_an und für sich)._ By the fact that the form is objectified, it does not become something other than the consciousness moulding the thing through work; for just that form is his pure self existence, which therein becomes truly realized. Thus precisely in labour where there seemed to be merely some outsider’s mind and ideas involved, the bondsman becomes aware, through this re-discovery of himself by himself, of having and being a “mind of his own”.

#### (c). The Formative Process of Self-Enfranchisement

For this reflection of self into self the two moments, fear and service in general, as also that of formative activity, are necessary: and at the same time both must exist in a universal manner. Without the discipline of service and obedience, fear remains formal and does not spread over the whole known reality of existence. Without the formative activity shaping the thing, fear remains inward and mute, and consciousness does not become objective for itself. Should consciousness shape and form the thing without the initial state of absolute fear, then it has a merely vain and futile “mind of its own”; for its form or negativity is not negativity _per se_, and hence its formative activity cannot furnish the consciousness of itself as essentially real. If it has endured not absolute fear, but merely some slight anxiety, the negative reality has remained external to it, its substance has not been through and through infected thereby. Since the entire content of its natural consciousness has not tottered and shaken, it is still inherently a determinate mode of being; having a “mind of its own” (_der eigene Sinn_) is simply stubbornness (_Eigensinn_), a type of freedom which does not get beyond the attitude of bondage. As little as the pure form can become its essential nature, so little is that form, considered as extending over particulars, a universal formative activity, an absolute notion; it is rather a piece of cleverness which has mastery within a certain range, but not over the universal power nor over the entire objective reality.

# Foreword  
to OUP Edition of _The Logic_, by J N Findlay 1973

THE present volume is a reprint, with one or two minor alterations, of the most masterly and influential of all English translations of Hegel: the _Logic of Hegel_ translated from the _Encyclopaedia of the_ _Philosophical Sciences_ by William Wallace, Whyte's Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Oxford, first published close on a century ago. Wallace, like Edward Caird, came to Oxford from across the Border, and was able, owing to some strange affinity of the then Scotland with an earlier Germany, to enter into the finer shades of Hegel's thought, language, and historical milieu in a manner impossible to his southern-born contemporaries, who might adopt and display Hegelian show-pieces in their heavily written works on Logic, Metaphysics, and Epistemology, but who could never follow, in its odd, wavering integrity, the line of a dialectic that was often most tellingly true when it leapt with what seemed the greatest irresponsibility to view matters from some higher, different point of view. That Wallace's often loose paraphrase of the Hegelian text is at all points beyond improvement will not here be maintained: it is, however, a translation for which one may be devoutly thankful, as one cannot be for the first translations of Hegel's other major works. And while the _Zusätze_ to the dense text which Leopold von Henning compiled from his own notes, and from the notes of his valued colleagues Hotho, Michelet, and Geyer — whose gaps he had at times the audacity to fill from his own personal memory of what Hegel had said — may fail to satisfy our new-found passions for documentation and doxography, we may be immeasurably glad that we have them too. Some passages from the _Zusätze_ in Wallace's rendering have led whole generations of students to a better understanding of Hegel. That 'a progression to infinity is not the real infinite which consists in being at home with itself in its other', that 'the consummation of the infinite End consists merely in removing the illusion that makes it seem yet unaccomplished' and that 'the Absolute Idea may be compared to the old man who utters the same creed as the child, but for whom it is pregnant with the significance of a lifetime': these are almost scriptural statements, contributing as preciously to our thought and language as some of the passages in the King James Bible. The last of the three passages just cited has a peculiar significance for the present writer, since Wallace's _Logic_ was among the first books on philosophy that he ever read, and will probably be among the last.

The importance of Wallace's work depends further on the importance of the _Encyclopaedia,_ which Wallace was not wrong in describing as 'the only complete, matured, and authentic statement of Hegel's philosophical system'. First published in 1817, and with many of the points made by Hegel in lectures added by him to the 1827 edition, it represents the endlessly proliferating _fourmillement_ of Hegel's thought, reduced at least to a modicum of translucency and settled repose. The _Phenomenology of Spirit_ of 1807 was, as Wallace says, the flight of a young Pegasus on which only a kingly soul could soar to the empyrean of the Idea: it might have all the 'diamond purity' of Hegelianism, but only consummate skill and patience could hope to use it with advantage. And, as Hegel himself said in _Encyclopaedia_ [§ 25](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL25), the _Phenomenology,_ though intended to be the introductory first part of his system, which would show how immediate consciousness must necessarily progress to the philosophical point of view, was in fact forced to take account of numberless concrete 'formations of consciousness', Religion, Morality, Art, etc., which were really the subject matter of other special branches of philosophy, and which included much that had gone on 'behind consciousness' and now required to be raised into consciousness. The _Phenomenology_ accordingly had to drag in much that properly belonged in another context, and as such it had defects which led to its replacement in the _Encyclopaedia_ ([§§ 1-78](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL1)) by what amounts to a new Introduction, including a _Vorbegriff_ and a study of the three main attitudes of previous philosophical thought to objectivity. The _Phenomenology,_ for all its brilliance, is therefore ceremoniously trundled away as an Introduction to the whole system, and when Hegel planned its republication in 1831, he penned the following note, reproduced by his publisher after his death: ‘Characteristic early work not to be revised — relevant to the period in which it was written — the abstract Absolute was dominant at the time of the _Preface_’ (_Phenomenology,_ Hoffmeister edition, p. 578). Its essential content, the development of Consciousness from a stage where it confronts an uninterpreted, objective presence in sense-certainty, to the stage at which it both recognises and is recognised by countless other embodiments of the same shared rationality, is presented, freed from brilliant incrustations and additions, in §§ 413-39 of the _Encyclopaedia_.

The other great work that preceded the publication of the _Encyclopaedia_, the _Science of Logic,_ first published in three parts in 1812, 1813, and 1816, and in a partially revised form after Hegel's death, can be said, despite its vastly greater richness of content and profounder coverage of certain transitions (e.g. the treatment of Natural Law in Book II, Section II, and also the full-length treatments of the Judgement and the Syllogism), to have been superseded by the _Logic_ of the _Encyclopaedia._ Hegel, we know, based the lecture-courses he gave on Logic practically every summer in Berlin on the _Encyclopaedia-Compendium,_ and it may be presumed that this treatment, greatly augmented as it was in 1827, reflects the pattern into which his thought on Logic had finally fallen, when he looked back on the unimaginable intricacies of the longer treatment in a more distant perspective. Certainly those who have worked through, and attempted to teach, the hardest sections of the longer work, e.g. Hegel's almost inconceivably obscure treatment of Measure in Book I, Section III, and of Show and Reflection in Book II, Section I, Chapter I, cannot help feeling that the line of Hegel's long argument comes out better in the shorter work, and that many of the, intricacies of the longer work are merely an interesting but dispensable, and at times artificially stirred up, foam upon its basic waves. It is the view of the present writer that Hegel is better seen macroscopically than microscopically, even though the latter may be a necessary preliminary to the former: the broad drifts of the dialectic, fixed as to starting-point and goal, do not depend on the minuter eddies than can with some strain be seen in it. One has to let the headaches produced by a continuous Bacchantic riot subside into the calm of a more distant, critical vision if one is to profit fully from the majestic assault of Hegel's genius. The _Science of Logic_ must indeed be used to fill in the spare outlines of _the Encyclopaedia_ treatment, but not a few of its windings can be mercifully blurred. The editorial _Zusätze_ previously mentioned are also extremely valuable as filling in the _Encyclopaedia's_ spareness: however much they may require to be disentangled and reprocessed in the scholarly editions of the future, they at least bring us into touch with the _spoken_ element which is quite essential in a philosophy like Hegel's, and they invariably illuminate and assist understanding, rather than confuse and complicate it.

We shall delay no more on scholarly minutiae. Wallace's _Bibliographical Notice_ on the three editions and three Prefaces of _the Encyclopaedia_ has not lost its value, and has the merit of stressing the connection of Hegel's Idea with the Idea of Plato and Aristotle in the second edition Preface, and the connection of Hegel's system with philosophical Christianity as brought out in the third edition Preface. The Notes and Illustrations are also valuable and at times amusing. What we must now try to illuminate are the points made in the _Einleitung_ and _Vorbegriff_ ([§§ 1-25](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL1)), really a new introduction to the System, the sections ([§§ 26-78](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iii.htm#SL26)) dealing with the three historic attitudes of past thought to objectivity, the very important sections ([§§ 79-83](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL79)) dealing with three basic 'moments' of all logical thought, and finally the three systematic chapters on the Doctrine of Being, the Doctrine of Essence, and the Doctrine of the Notion, which are parallel to the systematic treatment of the _Science of Logic._

In the first chapter of the _Encyclopaedia_ Hegel tells us that the Divine Absolute, the goal of philosophy as of religion, can only be approached in philosophy through explicit thought: all other forms of experience, such as feeling, intuition, picture-thought, etc., are only implicitly cogitative, and can at best offer us metaphors of the Absolute as it appears to thought. The Absolute is then said in [§ 6](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL6) to be an existent Reason, which is not only present in our subjective self-consciousness, but is also actual in the world, though not always discernible on the surface. The nature of thinking subjectivity comes out with even more clarity in the second chapter of the _Encyclopaedia._ Here its characteristic achievement is seen as the liberation of the Universal from the singularity of the sensed instance and from the mutual externality of such instances. It is also seen as a liberation of the instances and parts of the thinking person from his own singularity. The Ego, Hegel tells us, is the Universal in and for itself, and all Egos, qua Egos, are just what I am. The Ego, in fact, for Hegel ([§ 20](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL20)) has only a nuance of difference from the _activity_ of universalisation which is for Hegel the essential thing in thought: it is that activity conceived as a subject, itself universalised and given to itself, and not merely active in specific materials. The liberating activity of the Universal or the Ego is further said to be one that liberates the essential, intrinsic, or true nature of the object: it may profoundly change the _manner_ in which things stand before us in sensation, intuition, or representation, but this change of manner is no subjective distortion as maintained in the Critical Philosophy: it is a bringing out of what the thing in itself truly is. (Wallace, we may note, has slightly veered towards Kantianism in translating the Hegelian sentence in [§ 22](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL22), _Es ist somit nur vermittelst einer Veränderung dass_ _die wahre Natur des Gegenstandes zum Bewusstsein kommt,_ by 'Thus, it appears, an alteration of the object must be interposed before its true nature can be discovered.' Wallace's words 'of the object' are wrongly placed: Hegel does not hold that the mind alters its object, but that by altering the manner in which that object is given to it, it penetrates to its true, its universal nature.) Hegel further holds that while thinking universality is undoubtedly self-determined and free, it is also free from any personal wantonness or arbitrariness: its freedom consists in thinking in a manner that all thinking individuals have in common, and in immersing itself in the thing (_Sache_) and its actual determinations. The universals that thought liberates are, moreover, to be found in unliberated, merely objective, sleeping form in Nature, associated with all sorts of irrelevances and externalities, and their rise to subjectivity consists merely in their liberation from such immersion, and their coming to be in and for themselves. It is not necessary for one to observe how much all these dicta hark back to Plato and Aristotle rather than to Kant and Fichte.

In [§§ 26-83](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iii.htm#SL26) Hegel then goes on to deal with three philosophical attitudes to objectivity, with the old, pre-critical, realistic Metaphysics in §§ 26-36, with Empiricism and the Critical Philosophy in [§§ 37-60](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ivpi.htm#SL37), and with the Intuitionism of certain of Hegel's contemporaries in [§§ 61-78](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_v.htm#SL61). By Hegel the old, pre-critical, realistic Metaphysics is seen as superior to the Critical Philosophy in that it took the laws of thought to be the fundamental laws and forms of things' and assumed that to think a thing was the means of finding its very self and nature ([§ 28](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iii.htm#SL28)). It is, however, inferior to post-critical thought on the basic ground that it does not trouble to inquire into the sense of assertions made about objects of reason which cover all reality, e.g. God, the Cosmos, the Soul, and assumes that one can talk of them in precisely the same way as one talks of ordinary finite objects, borrowing one's conception of them from popular picture-thought, and imagining also that one can pit one antithetical statement about them against another just as one does in the case of ordinary finite things. But when one leaves the finite things of ordinary discourse, one also leaves the rules that govern discourse about such things. One has to frame new concepts of an embracing, non-antithetical kind, and not attempt to take over ill-formed popular concepts without modification. One has also to be prepared for the fact that it may not be possible to apply ordinary predicates to one's new objects, or that it may be equally suitable or unsuitable to affirm or deny such predicates of them. 'The metaphysic of understanding is dogmatic, because it maintains half-truths in their isolation, whereas the idealism of speculative philosophy carries out the principle of totality and can reach beyond the inadequate formularies of abstract thought. Thur, idealism would say: The soul is neither finite only nor infinite only.; it is really the one just as much as the other, and that way neither the one nor the other' ([§ 32](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iii.htm#SL32n)). Hegel is saying what has since been expressed by saying that in a new language-game expressions may be given new senses and rules of usage, and that one must not be surprised if expressions which functioned well in old language games have no function in the new one. But whereas modern linguistic conservatism tends to think that far-reaching departures from ordinary usage are suspect, despite any general charter to say what we like', Hegel believes in a series of philosophical games that will perpetually revise and reconstruct older ones, and will follow a certain deep logic in doing so, and so will in the end construct a new set of what may be called 'iridescent' concepts since they find a use for certain conjunctions and combinations of expressions which in a more ordinary use are thought to involve incompatibility or contradiction. Hegel in fact tries to show that there is a well-formed terminal style of discourse built with difficulty on all the patterns of discourse that precede it, and leaving them with a certain restricted validity, which seems from their point of view to involve self-contradiction, though it alone in fact, of all forms of discourse, completely avoids it. Curiously enough in the remarkable _Zusätze_ to § 32, Hegel anticipates even the ring of certain pronouncements of modern linguistic philosophy: where Wittgenstein makes it the task of the linguistic philosopher to cure the bewitchment of the understanding through the instruments of our speech (_Philosophical Investigations_, § 109), Hegel says that 'the battle of reason is the struggle to break up the rigidity to which the understanding has reduced everything', the understanding being the form of thought which continues to apply rigid rules and categories, which apply well in ordinary finite contexts, to the new, fluid, iridescent contexts and objects of Reason. That there is such a sphere of truly transcendental discourse, superseding yet gathering together all the forms of discourse that lead up to it, is of course the crowning thought of Hegel, which the chapter on the pre-critical Metaphysics first brings into the open.

In the next chapter Hegel is at first concerned with Empiricism, which has for him the great merit of recognising that the Universals or Notions which make the world intelligible are necessarily encountered in and through their experienced instantiation in that world. 'Whatever is true must be in the actual world and present to sense-perception' ([§ 38](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ivpi.htm#SL38)). Its deficiency lies, however, in failing to recognise that the Universality we encounter in sense-perception has features which go far beyond what is given in the encounters in question, and are sometimes so categorial that no set of such encounters can ever adequately body them forth.

In the Critical Philosophy of Kant this presence of universal, connective, transcendental features is fully realised, and is rightly connected with the thinking 'I' which can put nothing before itself except as embodying such connective universality ([§ 42](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL42)): Kant's error lies, however, in psychologising and subjectivising this subordination of the specific and instantial to such universal, connective unity, so that the latter is not thought of as revealing what things in themselves truly are, but only how they _appear_ to the subject. The Thing-in-itself which Kant holds to be unknowable is really the most completely knowable of abstractions: it is what we get when we deliberately leave out all empirical content and every vestige of categorial structure. Hegel may therefore be said to have laid bare the crypto-empiricism which haunts the thought of Kant: while recognising the non-empirical elements which structure experience and knowledge, he is yet forced to deny them reality or validity, since his secret test of these still lies in imagined sense-encounter with particulars. Hegel shows that such secretly empirical prepossessions vitiate Kant's criticism of the Transcendental Ideas: the Soul, the Cosmos, and God. Instead of seeing it as a defect of our merely empirical acquaintance with ourselves that we do not thereby rise to a full awareness of the structuring properties of thinking subjectivity, Kant rather sees it as a defect of that fuller awareness that it does not present us with a particular soul-thing on a level with the particulars of sense ([§ 47](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL47)). And instead of seeing the cosmological antinomies as proofs of the inherent oppositions involved in finite, cosmic actuality, Kant is forced, out of misplaced tenderness for a reality in or behind the cosmos, to see in such antinomies only the distortions of our perceiving and construing intelligence ([§ 48](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL48)). And instead, lastly, of regarding it as a defect of finite sensible objects like a hundred thalers that in their case real existence, vouched for by sense, falls apart from their pure notion or concept, he rather sees it as a defect of an ultimate Reason-object like God, that in His case Being and Notion cannot be held to fall apart as in the finite, empirical case ([§ 51](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL51)).

Hegel further points out, very interestingly, that the so-called proofs of the Divine Existence are not what they are ordinarily thought to be: purely affirmative reasonings in which what we start from furnishes a fixed, solid basis from which we pass on to something which has the same solidity as its premises. The action of thought is to _negate_ the basis from which it starts, to show it up as not being self-subsistent, and so to have in it a springboard from which it can ascend to what is truly self-subsistent and self-explanatory.

It is [Hegel says] because they do not, with sufficient prominence, express the negative features implied in the exaltation of the mind from the world to God, that the metaphysical proofs of the being of a God are defective interpretations and descriptions of the process ... That upward spring of the mind signifies that the being which the world has is only a semblance, no real being, no absolute truth; it signifies that, beyond and above that appearance, truth abides in God, so that true being is another name for God ... Unless the being of the world is nullified, the point _d'appui_ for the exaltation is lost. ([§ 50](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL50), Wallace)

In this passage Hegel not only explains the argument for a self-explanatory, absolute being, he also explains the whole nature of the dialectic. Nowhere does it merely elicit what some firm basis entails: everywhere does it rather overturn its basis as involving incompleteness or conflict, and then progresses by a leap to something more harmonious and complete. Those who expect all thought-advance to be that of the deduction of conclusions from firmly established premises are quite incapable of dialectical thinking: in dialectic it is the insufficiency of the premises that leads to the more sufficient conclusion.

Of Kant's other _Critiques_ Hegel gives a briefer criticism. Kant's treatment of Practical Reason as a thinking will, laying down objective laws of freedom which determine what shall happen, and legislating for the world as well as for the subject, is highly praised: it is seen as highly superior to a Eudaemonism which merely aims at satisfying the private appetites, wants, and wishes of particular men. Its defect lies, however, in its empty formalism, its failure to see that it is only as organising such appetites, wants, and wishes, that it can acquire content and concreteness ([§ 54](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL54)). The _Critique of Judgement,_ on the other hand, is held to have risen to the speculative height of the Idea, whether in its notion of a beauty in which thought and sensuous conception have grown into one, or in its postulation of a harmony between natural necessity and free purpose ([§ 55](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL55)). Kant is, however, unable to conceive of this harmony as anything more than what we demand, or what merely _ought_ to be: he is unable to rise to the notion of a harmony which, in being always in process of being achieved and recognised as such, is also in principle actual beyond every limit. Kant's whole procedure is brilliantly characterised as one of 'unifying at one moment what a moment before had been explained to be independent and therefore incapable of unification. And then, at the very moment after unification has been alleged to be the truth, we suddenly come upon the doctrine that the two elements, which, in their true status of unification, have been refused all independent subsistence, are only true and actual in their state of separation' (Wallace, p. 91). Kant, in short, is in a permanent philosophical muddle, and never knows where he has got to nor where he is going.

The third attitude of thought to objectivity ([§§ 61-78](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_v.htm#SL61)) is the immediate or intuitive attitude, the spokesman of which is for Hegel Jacobi, though we should probably put Bergson, with his intuitive understanding of duration, or G. E. Moore, with his unshakeable Commonsense Knowledge, in such a position. Hegel is not disposed to reject the view that we may have an intuitive certainty of many all-important things: of our own existence as thinking beings, of the existence of something ideally perfect which perhaps comes up unsought in our thought, of the existence of external objects which make an impression on our senses, and of various ethical and other principles. What he does dispute is that such intuitive immediacy is an infallible mark of objective validity and truth, and that, where an intuitive conviction is valid, it does not also admit of a mediating justification, which, even if it does not amount to a syllogistic deduction, will at least put our conviction in a whole context of other facts and convictions, so that it becomes mediated on every side and not merely self-attested. Hegel believes in the end in a self-mediation which differentiates itself into a large number of mutually mediating insights, and also 'that it lies in the very nature of thought and subjectivity to be inseparable from being and objectivity' (Wallace, p. 99), and this comprehensive self-mediation in a sense justifies all the immediacies that can be chosen as starting-points within it. Hegel's view of an implicit rationality even in immediacies which seem at odds with reason comes out in his subsequent treatment of mysticism (Wallace, p. 121). Mysticism may seem to be, even to itself, an attitude that quarrels with comprehension and consistency, and which is wholly mysterious and ineffable: it reveals itself, however, on closer examination as a deeply rational attitude which feels the impossibility of maintaining the hard and fast oppositions and distinctions appropriate to ordinary finite objects in the face of certain ultimate objects of Reason.

Hegel is then led on ([§§ 79-82](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL79)) to the very pregnant distinctions between three logical 'moments', which can, in an inadequate perspective, be held apart, but which in their actual being interpenetrate one another in every notion and every true assertion, as well as in the being of all the things in the world. The first of these moments is _das Verständige,_ that of the Understanding, whose _métier_ it is to separate off what each thing is, in and by itself, from whatever it is only in connection and collaboration with other things, and whose separate nature, thus cut adrift, becomes free from the change and development which variable contexts bring about. It is Hegel's view that this separative action of the Understanding is necessary both for efficient thought and action, in which he is at one with all analysts-and all organisers, things in the world having a distinct self-identity which it would be wrong to ignore or blur. But with this recognition of distinctness and separateness goes the belief that it is something that we have to pretend to and strive after, rather than actually achieve, and that it is in fact logically impossible of achievement. It is here that the Logic of Hegel really takes issue with the Common Logic, and that not by violating the rules and forms of that Logic, but by applying them differently. For to Hegel the notion of a content that can with success be held quite apart from other contents which oppose or complete it, is not anything that can be conceived or even symbolised: there is, in fact, a logical flux, a passing of contents tracelessly into one another, which is even more ineluctable and ultimate than the sensible flux from which it is easy to retreat by an effort of abstraction. This logical passage makes it impossible to achieve the clearness, distinctness, and fixity which the Understanding desiderates, except for a limited purpose and in a limited range or span. Plato, the great predecessor of Hegel, passionately fought this logical flux in his earlier dialogues, but in such more mature dialogues as the _Cratylus_ and the _Parmenides_ he is arguably not far from admitting it. In a given exercise we both can and should preserve comparative clarity, distinctness, and fixity, but the thought-material we are coercing never fully acquiesces in our fixations, and forces endless revision upon us no matter how we seek to withstand this.

There is, therefore, a second necessary 'moment' in logical thought, always emerging out of the fixing, separative acts of the Understanding, a moment which breaks down and destroys the fixities and separations thus produced, and which, after restoring fluidity, makes the emergence of new fixities and distinctions possible. This second moment in thought is called by Hegel Dialectic Proper: it is not unlike the linguistic 'cramps' mentioned by Wittgenstein in the _Blue Book_ which make us wish to depart from the conventions of ordinary speech in various philosophically interesting directions. To the Understanding Dialectic readily appears as a wholly destructive, self-contradictory force, but it is rather to be regarded as a force evoked by the inherent absurdity and self -contradiction of the sort of fixity and separateness which the Understanding strives for. And so far is it from being anything genuinely self-nullifying, and so non-existent, that the perpetual flux of being in the world is no more than an instantial manifestation of the essential logical flux. The world changes, not as the early Plato thought, because it participates in ever differing but unchanging Eide, but because the Eide in which it participates are themselves arranged in a developing series, in which each gets taken up and passes away into its logical successor.

It is not, however, possible to fix and separate the flux of Dialectic Proper, any more than anything else, and it is in fact always being taken up into the third moment of logical thought which Hegel calls Reason. This Reason has some of the reasonableness of ordinary speech, which shuns an utter exactness which it knows it cannot reach, and which is not afraid to hesitate and to refuse to say either Yea or Nay in certain obviously borderline situations. That reasonableness has, however, some of the connotation of the lazy, whereas the Hegelian Reason is one that, with the clearest consciousness of what it is doing, sees things in a round of what there is an inclination to call incompatible lights, but in what for a sufficiently experienced and nimble mind are perfectly reconcilable. Such reasonable concepts have the stability of the Understanding, without unleashing the Dialectic which too great an exactness and exclusiveness would at once arouse. They involve, as noted before, something like the experienced iridescence where slight shifts of vision reveal startlingly new colours, or something like the experienced combination of incompatible viewpoints which occurs in stereoscopic or stroboscopic vision. All our conscious references to things out there, to other people, to what has been or what will be or what ought to be, involve what, from the strict standpoint of the Understanding, is a definite contradiction, and which none the less proves a living, incontestable fact: it is not, therefore, an indefensible strategy, nor one different from what most of us practise, to see in the ardent rigidities of the Understanding the true source of contradiction and absurdity, while the iridescent, multi-dimensional poises of Reason are the correct form of the harmonious and true. This at least is what Hegel prescribes in the four remarkable paragraphs we have mentioned: it is arguable that there is no philosopher of any stature who is not great just because he has swallowed, and in some difficult manner digested, and induced others also to swallow and digest, what is, from the. standpoint of clear, one-sided thought, a plain and obvious contradiction.

From all these interesting preliminaries to the System, we now turn to the three dialectically ordered chapters of the Logic Proper: the Doctrine of Being, the Doctrine of Essence, and the Doctrine of the Notion or _Begriff._ On these intricately structured chapters we cannot give a running commentary: we can at best state certain general viewpoints from which they may be studied. The Doctrines of Being and Essence form what Hegel calls the Objective Logic: in them what is ideal and universal has not yet separated itself off from the phenomenal surface of the Existent, nor made the latter merely an outflow of itself. When this last happens, we have the Subjective Logic, or Logic of the Notion, which is not, we may note, subjective in an ordinary sense. The Doctrine of Being is said by Hegel ([§ 83](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_divis.htm#SL83)) to represent the Notion in its immediacy, the Notion as yet implicit or undeveloped. We may ourselves say that it deals with the merely _Descriptive Categories_ of Thought and Being, the Categories in which the mere _being_ of things comes to light, and is stereotyped into quality and quantity and suchlike attributions, without ever delving beneath the surface or seeking to explain anything. The Doctrine of Essence is said by Hegel to study the Notion in its Reflection and Mediation, in its Being-for-self, and its Show. We ourselves may say that it deals with the _Explanatory Categories,_ those that postulate a deeper level of the permanently essential beneath the surface layer of mere fact: this is the field in which fixed natures or dispositions, relations of mutual influence or necessitation, ordination to unchanging laws, and rigorous distinctions of natural type, play a pivotal part. The Doctrine of the Notion is said by Hegel to be the Notion in its return to self, and in its developed abiding by self: the Notion in and for itself. We ourselves may say that it deals with the _Self-mediated or Self_-_explanatory Categories,_ those that, in explaining themselves, not requiring external justification, also explain everything. They are the absolutist Categories in which traditional Metaphysics has believed, but with which merely descriptive or relativistic types of thought have thought that they could dispense. The Doctrine of the Notion both preserves and sets aside the difficult dualisms and oppositions that have been developed in the Doctrine of Essence, returning to something remotely like the surface-harmony of the Categories of Being. The sense of these somewhat enigmatic characterisations will become plainer in the survey that where every whole fades indistinguishably into wider wholes or follows.

The Doctrine of Being begins with the much too famous triad of Being, Nothing, and Becoming, which does no more than attest the indistinguishable emptiness of categories which are without the internal differentiation of mutually contrasted definites or finites. Hegel's philosophy is a philosophy of the definite, the finite, almost from the start: it can attach no meaning to notions in which all fades out in an Oriental blur. The Understanding therefore enters the stage with _Dasein,_ finite determinate being, the being of a something which essentially lives in an indefinitely extensible context of other somethings, each having its own peculiarity, its quality, but only sustaining that peculiarity, that quality, in virtue of the contrasting somethings surrounding it. Hegel makes plain that the enumerative thought which does no more than distinguish this from that is not aware of the thorough-going relativity which haunts its proceedings: we, the logicians, see the inseparability of the this from the that and their mutual relativity, but such relativity will only become _explicit_ when we go on to the reflective Categories of Essence. At present we live in a stage of thought where each limited existent seems to have an absolute independence: many philosophers, who hold the world to be simply the aggregate of all that there is, have never advanced beyond this simple position. Hegel, however, makes plain the wholly absurd character of mere qualitative distinctness: we try to grasp its peculiar distinctiveness, but it wholly eludes us. All we can say and communicate regarding each finite, qualified thing is that it is wholly unique and peculiar, and this character it shares with every other finite, qualified thing. Qualities, as Plato pointed out in the _Theaetetus_ and elsewhere, are essentially vanishing, private, incommunicable products: if we are to lay hold of anything with our minds and communicate it to minds in general, it can only be in terms of the pure universalities of number and measure. The distinction of the entities in the world therefore becomes a distinction without a difference: each entity has its own pure Being-for-self in which it is indistinguishable from every other entity. But this lack of true difference forces us on from discrete plurality to continuous quantity. We pass into a logical region where every whole fades indistinguishably into wider wholes or reveals other partial wholes within it. The 'Bad Infinites' of the indefinitely Great and the indefinitely Small loom on either side, for Hegel as for Plato, and seem to remove all meaning from number and quantity.

The reasonable result of this dialectic is, however, the emergence of a concept of Measure (_Mass_), in which relative magnitude or Ratio, the sort of magnitude that can stay constant despite indefinite alteration in absolute quantity, takes the place of absolute quantity, and which is now re-associated with a quality which is the outward sign of its presence. Hegel here puts forward a doctrine of infinite interest and great scientific relevance, which few of his interpreters have understood: that the contrast between what are commonly called Primary and Secondary Qualities has something necessary about it. Purely quantitative distinctions, even those expressed in fixed ratios, are quite without content unless documented by emergent differences of quality, while purely qualitative distinctions are likewise without meaningful content unless capable of being connected with a continuously varying scheme of quantities. The notion of those reactionaries, from Aristotle to Husserl, who fear to depart from the qualitative 'life-world', as well as the notion of those radical formalists, from Descartes to Einstein, who would like to reduce everything to quantity, are therefore alike rejected. And Hegel further teaches the doctrine of an interestingly necessary out-of-stepness between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of natural being. While the former necessarily proceeds by discrete leaps, the latter is necessarily quite continuous. This means that quantitative change can proceed for a long time without a change in quality, and then, when an appropriate 'node' is passed, a new quality will emerge to attest new underlying ratios, These doctrines are not interesting if treated as mere 'facts of life' as they have been by some Marxists: Hegel makes them interesting by arguing that they are necessarily true.

The logical transition from the Doctrine of Being to the Doctrine of Essence, though veiled in much obscure verbiage, amounts to no more than our complete inability to understand or believe in a mere set of unexplained surface facts, however much decked out in exact formulae of quality and quantity. Mere facts vanish in our hands: they are incapable of being remembered or predicted. The transition to Essence lies simply in our need to form concepts of permanent nature or disposition, or of inviolable law, which will add to the surface description of what momentarily is the deeper, invariant statement of what can be, or what would be, or what must be, or what must have been, whether absolutely or in given circumstances. These categories, whether called 'modal' or 'dynamic' or 'nomic' or 'explanatory', are what certain types of psychologistic or phenomenalistic or logico-mathematical thought try to dispense with altogether: Hegel, however, sees in them something necessary and logical. A world in which there are no clear permanences of nature, no repeating rubrics of class, no definitely limited generalities of behaviour, is not anything that can be thought of or that can be. 'The ordinary consciousness', it is said in the _Zusätze to_ [§ 110](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL110), 'conceives things as being, and studies them in quality, quantity, and measure. These immediate characteristics however soon show themselves to be not fixed but transient, and Essence is the result of their dialectic.' To which the _Zusätze to_ [§ 112](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slessenc.htm#SL112) adds the following:

The problem or aim of philosophy is often represented as the ascertainment of the essence of things: a phrase which only means that things instead of being left in their immediacy, must be shown to-be mediated by, or based upon, something else . There is a permanent in things, and that permanent is in the first instance their essence ... Still it should be remembered that the only means by which the Essence and the inner self can be verified is their appearance in outward reality.

_The Encyclopaedia_ treatment of Essence spares us the quite agonising obscurities of three types of reflection distinguished in _the Science of Logic:_ it proceeds straight to the three basic Categories of Reflection, namely Identity, Difference, and Ground. These are connected by Hegel with much revised versions of the traditional Logical Laws of Identity, Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Identity of Indiscernibles, and Sufficient Ground. Everywhere in the world we must, according to Hegel, dig down to deep identities of Essence, spanning wide ranges of surface-difference, to which an instinct of reason must guide us. This deep identity is not the trivial identity which every arbitrarily distinguished item has with itself, but an identity of _principle_ which can be discerned in quite widely disparate acts and thoughts and existences, as Hegel in the dialectic is constantly showing. But everywhere in the world we must likewise dig down to deep differences of Essence: what is the same generically must also be different specifically, and there is nothing even casually individual in which such essential difference is not also present. And such difference of Essence is always ready to be sharpened into incompatibility or opposition, without prejudice to its deeper identity. It is then characteristic of Hegel to find opposition swinging over into a common groundedness which also makes things reciprocally ground and consequent to one another: in the very exclusion of _A by_ B, there is an entailment that B, and not only A, should be, and thereby an inclusion of B in A's Essence. It is, to take a modern psychoanalytic example, in the most entrenched opposition of the two sexes that their groundedness in a common Man-Womanhood is most palpably evident, as well as the possibility that each of them should develop the traits of the other.

The universal groundedness of things in things has therefore to be dug down to everywhere, and this leads Hegel on to consider the many obscurities which surround the conception of the propertied Thing-in the more precise sense of 'Thing'-all of whose characteristic properties consist solely in the way in which what the Thing is at any moment gears in with what other Things are or might "be. Reflections of this relativistic sort soon dissolve the world of self-existent Things into a network of manifestations, in which, however, the essential and permanent, in shifting from Things, has to transfer its force to the new notion of unchanging Laws.

The relation of the changeable phenomenal world to the unchanging Law-world is then gone into somewhat inadequately - _the Science of Logic_ is here very much better-and the two orders are more and more brought together in a single structure, in which woulds and coulds become part of what is, just as what is becomes merely a special case of what would or what could be. The dialectic then shifts to various forms of immanent and transient conditioning and causality: to a view of things as a single, self-developing Spinozistic Substance, to a view of things as successive phases each enjoying the unique prerogative of momentary actuality, and transmitting the heritage of their predecessors to their successors, and to the view, finally, of the world as consisting of a vast number of interacting Substances, each of which, in being acted upon by the other, may be said equally to act on the other to act upon itself, and so, by a circuit, to be covertly self-active or free.

This covert self-activity or freedom becomes overt self-activity and freedom with the next turn of the dialectic, which carries us over into the Doctrine of the Notion. The 'truth' of the pattern of mutual necessitation with which Essence terminates is said to be Freedom, in that free self-activity is what mutual necessitation dimly prefigures, and what must be rendered overt for the significant completion of the latter. Free self-activity will soon take the form of organic purpose or teleology, of which conscious thought is the culmination, and Hegel is in fact saying that the blind necessities of inorganic nature, and any other blind necessities, are only possible or intelligible as fitting with, or being capable of being used by, pervasive, organic purposes. And Hegel is not saying this because he _wants_ the self-explanatory unity of teleology to dominate indefinitely extending, necessitarian explanation, but because he believes that the latter conception is inferior to the former from an explanatory, logical point of view. If unexplainable fact is impossible, and if the explanations of necessitarianism merely refer us back to further unexplained facts without end, then we obviously require a type of explanation that is in a benign manner circular, bent back upon itself, and this we have in the various teleological categories of the Notion.

The Doctrine of the _Begriff_ or Notion starts by explaining the doctrine of concrete universality which was lightly sketched in the introductory chapters of the work. True Universality is as much in-the-world or objective as it is in-the-mind or subjective, it is essentially active and self-realising rather than inert, and it includes in itself the full round of its mutually exclusive species, and lives and achieves full specification in its individual instances. It is, moreover, not this or that specific universal, but rather the generic principle of all universality, or Universality as Such. It is further not to be identified with any chance conception that men may form, but only with the good, the standard form of everything, by exemplying which each thing becomes truly or actually what it is. This last qualification of the Notion is brought out in the [§§ 178-9](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sljudge.htm#SL178), devoted to Judgements of the Notion, Judgements in which a thing, e.g. a particular man or a work of art, has a value-predicate attributed to it, is said to realise its Notion, to be actually or truly this or that. The Hegelian _Begriff_ has therefore many of the properties of a Platonic or an Aristotelian _Eidos,_ though brought to a clearer focus: it has little that connects it with a _Begriff_ in the thought of Hegel's predecessors. 'Hegel's whole strategy is to see in his principle of active,. concrete Universality, a principle that has no contrast, except in and for itself: it is only by an illusion that it can be opposed to an external realm of objective fact, or to an undigested experience on which it imposes order. It does not, however, lie behind the surface of existence as in the case of the categories of Essence, nor is it merely part of this surface, as in the case of the categories of Being, but remains as a permanent directive force, active and fulfilled in specification and instantiation.

This immanent Atlas first displays itself in a transformed version of the traditional judgment-forms and forms of syllogism. In these, operative in the copula 'is', it unites the individual with the species, the species with the genus, and the genus with the individual, in a round of forms that achieve greater 'truth' according as the distinct 'moments' are more profoundly and necessarily united, and not merely brought together in an external, matter-of-fact manner. That Socrates is great and good is more profoundly true, because expressing a coincidence of notion with instance, than that the wallpaper is green or that Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and a disjunctive syllogism that finally places an individual in a whole round of mutually exclusive species has more of the Notion in it than an extensional syllogism that places an individual in one class because he happens to fall in another class that happens to be ranged under the first. These ideas are more fully developed in the _Science of Logic_ than the _Encyclopaedia,_ and/have been more profoundly studied and used by British thinkers like MacRan, Bradley, and Bosanquet than by anyone else.

The going forth of Universality into the specific and the individual can, however, be seen, by a shift of the dialectic, as an inherent reference of the individual instance to the species and genera present in it. The individual becomes a specimen, a concrete embodiment of organising universality, and lives together with other similar specimens in a world organised by the same Universal. It is here, after a brief skirmish with Mechanism and Chemism, that Hegel puts forth Teleology as the supreme objective expression of the Notion. This Teleology is not that of external design, but of immanent, Aristotelian purpose, and it is not that of a design which borrows its content from outside, but rather design for the sake of design, which remains orientated towards itself in infinitely numerous finite projects that succeed one another: it is, further, not design which is merely relevant to a pre-existent situation, but which is covertly responsible for the pre-existences that it presupposes, and is in fact the secret _raison_ _d'étre_ of all its means, projects, procedures, and situational backgrounds. To see the objective world as Ideal Pattern, for ever going through its organising act in its own programme of self-fulfilment, is to achieve the vision of infinite teleology with which Hegel now presents us, thereby rising to the Idea (see [§ 212](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slobject.htm#SL212), plus _Zusätze_).

The immediate, purely objective expression of the idea is Life, the actual act or process of living in. which all organs and functions serve merely to secure their own integrated continuance, in which everything external is made to do service to organic self-maintenance, which moreover perpetuates itself in an endless series of individuals. The purpose of life is solely to go on living, in a variety of species and specimens, and, in so far as the inorganic environment has any purpose, that purpose is to serve as a stimulus or an instrument or an untoward provocation to more and more living. The maintenance of Life is therefore the Absolute Purpose which explains everything objective.

We see, however, something essentially incomplete, and forced into the bad infinity of perpetual repetition, in the materialised singularity of Life, and this makes our minds leap upwards to a more complete embodiment of immanent Teleology, the embodiment we know as Conscious Cognition, in which Universality enjoys the free life that it can only have in a mind or spirit which uses it for purposes of understanding and mastering the world. Such Conscious Cognition assumes the two forms of Theory and Practice: Theory, in which the Universal is for ever laying hold on what seem to be external, unorganised data, and coming to see them as wholly pervaded by itself, and Practice, which is only a superior form of thinking, which not only organises on the plane of the Universal, but also creeps down into the last detail of the individual and transforms it utterly. Theory and Practice, however, both, seem to exhibit the Bad Infinite: they press on to a goal of perfected understanding and achievement which they can never reach. But at this point, when all seems in jeopardy, the Absolute Idea makes a saving appearance. The line of development involved in infinite teleology, which is simply the line worked out in Hegel's whole dialectic up to this point, is its own goal. The 'Other' which seems to stand around us in Life, and before us in Theory and Practice, is simply the shadow cast by our own spiritual activity, whose whole function, as a shadow, is to retreat endlessly as that activity progresses. This progress is not, as in Fichte, something that _ought_ to be completed: it ought not to be completed, because it is perfect as it is.

All unsatisfied endeavour ceases [we read in [§ 234](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slidea.htm#SL234)] when we recognise that the final purpose of the world is accomplished no less than accomplishing itself. Generally speaking, this is the man's way of looking, while the young imagine that the world is utterly sunk in wickedness, and that the first thing needful is a thorough transformation. The religious mind on the contrary views the world as ruled by Divine Providence, and thereby correspondent with what it ought to be. But this harmony between the is and the ought to be is not torpid and rigidly stationary. Good, the final end of the world, has being only while it constantly produces itself. And the world of spirit and the world of nature continue to have this distinction, that the latter moves only in a recurring cycle, while the former also makes progress.

The outcome of the Logic of Hegel, its Absolute Idea, is thus simply the axiomatic convergence, which can also be viewed as a coincidence, of what is and what ought to be, but which is also the Categorical Imperative that this convergence or coincidence should be unendingly pursued, and the religious blessedness of realising it to be eternally achieved. If these are not axioms or imperatives usually included in Logic, or even in Ethics or Metaphysics, it is perhaps the great merit of Hegel that he has made them pivotal and explanatory, and not left them peripheral and unexplained.

The present Foreword is no more than an attempt to create a sense of the general drift of Hegel's Logic and to show how it anticipates the whole concrete treatment of Nature and Spirit which follows upon it, and which cannot be understood without it. Logic is, for Hegel, the realm of shadows, of simple essentialities, stripped of all sensuous concretion (_Science of Logic,_ Lasson, vol. i, p. 41), but it is equally the realm of truth as it is in and for itself and without veil, the presentation of God, as He was in his eternal essence before the creation of Nature and finite Spirit (_ibid_., p. 31). Those who are unwilling to see Hegel as an ontologist and First Philosopher, or as a theologian in the sense of Aristotle or Proclus, will never be able to make more than a partial use of his brilliant insights, or become liberated from the sheer arbitrariness and inconsequence of much of his detail, which must be carefully studied only to be put in place and set aside.

The Wallace translation of the _Encyclopaedia Logic,_ with its inclusion of the precious remains of Hegel's oral discourse, has made the understanding of Hegel's ontology and theology possible to many Anglo-American philosophers in the past, and may now, it is hoped, continue to do so for some time.

### Part 1: Hegel

![hegel](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.gif)

The volume before us [(1)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#1) carries us back to a period which, although in time no more than a generation behind us, has become as foreign to the present generation in Germany as if it were already a hundred years old. Yet it was the period of Germany’s preparation for the Revolution of 1848; and all that has happened since then in our country has been merely a continuation of 1848, merely the execution of the last will and testament of the revolution.

Just as in France in the 18th century, so in Germany in the 19th, a philosophical revolution ushered in the political collapse. But how different the two looked! The French were in open combat against all official science, against the church and often also against the state; their writings were printed across the frontier, in Holland or England, while they themselves were often in jeopardy of imprisonment in the Bastille. On the other hand, the Germans were professors, state-appointed instructors of youth; their writings were recognized textbooks, and the termination system of the whole development — the Hegelian system — was even raised, as it were, to the rank of a royal Prussian philosophy of state! Was it possible that a revolution could hide behind these professors, behind their obscure, pedantic phrases, their ponderous, wearisome sentences? Were not precisely these people who were then regarded as the representatives of the revolution, the liberals, the bitterest opponents of this brain-confusing philosophy? But what neither the government nor the liberals saw was seen at least by one man as early as 1833, and this man was indeed none other than Heinrich Heine.[[A]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#A)

Let us take an example. No philosophical proposition has earned more gratitude from narrow-minded governments and wrath from equally narrow-minded liberals than Hegel’s famous statement: “All that is real is rational; and all that is rational is real.” That was tangibly a sanctification of things that be, a philosophical benediction bestowed upon despotism, police government, Star Chamber proceedings and censorship. That is how Frederick William III and how his subjects understood it. But according to Hegel certainly not everything that exists is also real, without further qualification. For Hegel the attribute of reality belongs only to that which at the same time is necessary: “In the course of its development reality proves to be necessity.” A particular governmental measure — Hegel himself cites the example of “a certain tax regulation” — is therefore for him by no means real without qualification. That which is necessary, however, proves itself in the last resort to be also rational; and, applied to the Prussian state of that time, the Hegelian proposition, therefore, merely means: this state is rational, corresponds to reason, insofar as it is necessary; and if it nevertheless appears to us to be evil, but still, in spite of its evil character, continues to exist, then the evil character of the government is justified and explained by the corresponding evil character of its subjects. The Prussians of that day had the government that they deserved.

Now, according to Hegel, reality is, however, in no way an attribute predictable of any given state of affairs, social or political, in all circumstances and at all times. On the contrary. The Roman Republic was real, but so was the Roman Empire, which superseded it. In 1789, the French monarchy had become so unreal, that is to say, so robbed of all necessity, so irrational, that it had to be destroyed by the Great Revolution, of which Hegel always speaks with the greatest enthusiasm. In this case, therefore, the monarchy was the unreal and the revolution the real. And so, in the course of development, all that was previously real becomes unreal, loses it necessity, its right of existence, its rationality. And in the place of moribund reality comes a new, viable reality — peacefully if the old has enough intelligence to go to its death without a struggle; forcibly if it resists this necessity. Thus the Hegelian proposition turns into its opposite through Hegelian dialectics itself: All that is real in the sphere of human history, becomes irrational in the process of time, is therefore irrational by its very destination, is tainted beforehand with irrationality, and everything which is rational in the minds of men is destined to become real, however much it may contradict existing apparent reality. In accordance with all the rules of the Hegelian method of thought, the proposition of the rationality of everything which is real resolves itself into the other proposition: All that exists deserves to perish.

But precisely therein lay the true significance and the revolutionary character of the Hegelian philosophy (to which, as the close of the whole movement since Kant, we must here confine ourselves), that it once and for all dealt the death blow to the finality of all product of human thought and action. Truth, the cognition of which is the business of philosophy, was in the hands of Hegel no longer an aggregate of finished dogmatic statements, which, once discovered, had merely to be learned by heart. Truth lay now in the process of cognition itself, in the long historical development of science, which mounts from lower to ever higher levels of knowledge without ever reaching, by discovering so-called absolute truth, a point at which it can proceed no further, where it would have nothing more to do than to fold its hands and gaze with wonder at the absolute truth to which it had attained. And what holds good for the realm of philosophical knowledge holds good also for that of every other kind of knowledge and also for practical action. Just as knowledge is unable to reach a complete conclusion in a perfect, ideal condition of humanity, so is history unable to do so; a perfect society, a perfect “state”, are things which can only exist in imagination. On the contrary, all successive historical systems are only transitory stages in the endless course of development of human society from the lower to the higher. Each stage is necessary, and therefore justified for the time and conditions to which it owes its origin. But in the face of new, higher conditions which gradually develop in its own womb, it loses vitality and justification. It must give way to a higher stage which will also in its turn decay and perish. Just as the bourgeoisie by large-scale industry, competition, and the world market dissolves in practice all stable time-honored institutions, so this dialectical philosophy dissolves all conceptions of final, absolute truth and of absolute states of humanity corresponding to it. For it [dialectical philosophy], nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain. It has, of course, also a conservative side; it recognizes that definite stages of knowledge and society are justified for their time and circumstances; but only so far. The conservatism of this mode of outlook is relative; its revolutionary character is absolute — the only absolute dialectical philosophy admits.

It is not necessary, here, to go into the question of whether this mode of outlook is thoroughly in accord with the present state of natural science, which predicts a possible end even for the Earth, and for its habitability a fairly certain one; which therefore recognizes that for the history of mankind, too, there is not only an ascending but also a descending branch. At any rate, we still find ourselves a considerable distance from the turning-point at which the historical course of society becomes one of descent, and we cannot expect Hegelian philosophy to be concerned with a subject which natural science, in its time, had not at all placed upon the agenda as yet.

But what must, in fact, be said here is this: that in Hegel the views developed above are not so sharply delineated. They are a necessary conclusion from his method, but one which he himself never drew with such explicitness. And this, indeed, for the simple reason that he was compelled to make a system and, in accordance with traditional requirements, a system of philosophy must conclude with some sort of absolute truth. Therefore, however much Hegel, especially in his _Logic_, emphasized that this eternal truth is nothing but the logical, or, the historical, process itself, he nevertheless finds himself compelled to supply this process with an end, just because he has to bring his system to a termination at some point or other. In his _Logic_, he can make this end a beginning again, since here the point of the conclusion, the absolute idea — which is only absolute insofar as he has absolutely nothing to say about it — “alienates”, that is, transforms, itself into nature and comes to itself again later in the mind, that is, in thought and in history. But at the end of the whole philosophy, a similar return to the beginning is possible only in one way. Namely, by conceiving of the end of history as follows: mankind arrives at the cognition of the self-same absolute idea, and declares that this cognition of the absolute idea is reached in Hegelian philosophy. In this way, however, the whole dogmatic content of the Hegelian system is declared to be absolute truth, in contradiction to his dialectical method, which dissolves all dogmatism. Thus the revolutionary side is smothered beneath the overgrowth of the conservative side. And what applies to philosophical cognition applies also to historical practice. Mankind, which, in the person of Hegel, has reached the point of working out the absolute idea, must also in practice have gotten so far that it can carry out this absolute idea in reality. Hence the practical political demands of the absolute idea on contemporaries may not be stretched too far. And so we find at the conclusion of the _Philosophy of Right_ that the absolute idea is to be realized in that monarchy based on social estates which Frederick William III so persistently but vainly promised to his subjects, that is, in a limited, moderate, indirect rule of the possessing classes suited to the petty-bourgeois German conditions of that time; and, moreover, the necessity of the nobility is demonstrated to us in a speculative fashion.

The inner necessities of the system are, therefore, of themselves sufficient to explain why a thoroughly revolutionary method of thinking produced an extremely tame political conclusion. As a matter of fact, the specific form of this conclusion springs from this, that Hegel was a German, and like his contemporary Goethe had a bit of the philistine’s queue dangling behind. Each of them was an Olympian Zeus in his own sphere, yet neither of them ever quite freed himself from German philistinism.

But all this did not prevent the Hegelian system from covering an incomparably greater domain than any earlier system, nor from developing in this domain a wealth of thought, which is astounding even today. The phenomenology of mind (which one may call a parallel of the embryology and palaeontology of the mind, a development of individual consciousness through its different stages, set in the form of an abbreviated reproduction of the stages through which the consciousness of man has passed in the course of history), logic, natural philosophy, philosophy of mind, and the latter worked out in its separate, historical subdivisions: philosophy of history, of right, of religion, history of philosophy, aesthetics, etc. — in all these different historical fields Hegel labored to discover and demonstrate the pervading thread of development. And as he was not only a creative genius but also a man of encyclopaedic erudition, he played an epoch-making role in every sphere. It is self-evident that owing to the needs of the “system” he very often had to resort to those forced constructions about which his pigmy opponents make such a terrible fuss even today. But these constructions are only the frame and scaffolding of his work. If one does not loiter here needlessly, but presses on farther into the immense building, one finds innumerable treasures which today still possess undiminshed value. With all philosophers it is precisely the “system” which is perishable; and for the simple reason that it springs from an imperishable desire of the human mind — the desire to overcome all contradictions. But if all contradictions are once and for all disposed of, we shall have arrived at so-called absolute truth — world history will be at an end. And yet it has to continue, although there is nothing left for it to do — hence, a new, insoluble contradiction. As soon as we have once realized — and in the long run no one has helped us to realize it more than Hegel himself — that the task of philosophy thus stated means nothing but the task that a single philosopher should accomplish that which can only be accomplished by the entire human race in its progressive development — as soon as we realize that, there is an end to all philosophy in the hitherto accepted sense of the word. One leaves alone “absolute truth”, which is unattainable along this path or by any single individual; instead, one pursues attainable relative truths along the path of the positive sciences, and the summation of their results by means of dialectical thinking. At any rate, with Hegel philosophy comes to an end; on the one hand, because in his system he summed up its whole development in the most splendid fashion; and on the other hand, because, even though unconsciously, he showed us the way out of the labyrinth of systems to real positive knowledge of the world.

One can imagine what a tremendous effect this Hegelian system must have produced in the philosophy-tinged atmosphere of Germany. It was a triumphant procession which lasted for decades and which by no means came to a standstill on the death of Hegel. On the contrary, it was precisely from 1830 to 1840 that “Hegelianism” reigned most exclusively, and to a greater or lesser extent infected even its opponents. It was precisely in this period that Hegelian views, consciously or unconsciously, most extensively penetrated the most diversified sciences and leavened even popular literature and the daily press, from which the average “educated consciousness” derives its mental pabulum. But this victory along the whole front was only the prelude to an internal struggle.

As we have seen, the doctrine of Hegel, taken as a whole, left plenty of room for giving shelter to the most diverse practical party views. And in the theoretical Germany of that time, two things above all were practical: religion and politics. Whoever placed the chief emphasis on the Hegelian _system_ could be fairly conservative in both spheres; whoever regarded the dialectical _method_ as the main thing could belong to the most extreme opposition, both in politics and religion. Hegel himself, despite the fairly frequent outbursts of revolutionary wrath in his works, seemed on the whole to be more inclined to the conservative side. Indeed, his system had cost him much more “hard mental plugging” than his method. Towards the end of the thirties, the cleavage in the school became more and more apparent. The Left wing, the so-called Young Hegelians, in their fight with the pietist orthodox and the feudal reactionaries, abandoned bit by bit that philosophical-genteel reserve in regard to the burning questions of the day which up to that time had secured state toleration and even protection for their teachings. And when in 1840, orthodox pietism and absolutist feudal reaction ascended the throne with Frederick William IV, open partisanship became unavoidable. The fight was still carried on with philosophical weapons, but no longer for abstract philosophical aims. It turned directly on the destruction of traditional religion and of the existing state. And while in the _Deutsche Jahrbucher_ [[B]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#B)the practical ends were still predominantly put forward in philosophical disguise, in the _Rheinische Zeitung_ of 1842 the Young Hegelian school revealed itself directly as the philosophy of the aspiring radical bourgeoisie and used the meagre cloak of philosophy only to deceive the censorship.

At that time, however, politics was a very thorny field, and hence the main fight came to be directed against religion; this fight, particularly since 1840, was indirectly also political. Strauss’ _Life of Jesus_, published in 1835, had provided the first impulse. The theory therein developed of the formation of the gospel myths was combated later by Bruno Bauer with proof that a whole series of evangelic stories had been fabricated by the authors themselves. The controversy between these two was carried out in the philosophical disguise of a battle between “self-consciousness” and “substance”. The question whether the miracle stories of the gospels came into being through unconscious-traditional myth-creation within the bosom of the community or whether they were fabricated by the evangelists themselves was magnified into the question whether, in world history, “substance” or “self-consciousness” was the decisive operative force. Finally came Stirner, the prophet of contemporary anarchism — Bakunin has taken a great deal from him — and capped the sovereign “self-consciousness” by his sovereign “ego”[[C]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#C).

We will not go further into this side of the decomposition process of the Hegelian school. More important for us is the following: the main body of the most determined Young Hegelians was, by the practical necessities of its fight against positive religion, driven back to Anglo-French materialism. This brought them into conflict with the system of their school. While materialism conceives nature as the sole reality, nature in the Hegelian system represents merely the “alienation” of the absolute idea, so to say, a degradation of the idea. At all events, thinking and its thought-product, the idea, is here the primary, nature the derivative, which only exists at all by the condescension of the idea. And in this contradiction they floundered as well or as ill as they could.

Then came Feuerbach’s _Essence of Christianity_[[D]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#D). With one blow, it pulverized the contradiction, in that without circumlocutions it placed materialism on the throne again. Nature exists independently of all philosophy. It is the foundation upon which we human beings, ourselves products of nature, have grown up. Nothing exists outside nature and man, and the higher beings our religious fantasies have created are only the fantastic reflection of our own essence. The spell was broken; the “system” was exploded and cast aside, and the contradiction, shown to exist only in our imagination, was dissolved. One must himself have experienced the liberating effect of this book to get an idea of it. Enthusiasm was general; we all became at once Feuerbachians. How enthusiastically Marx greeted the new conception and how much — in spite of all critical reservations — he was influenced by it, one may read in the _The Holy Family_[[E]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#E).

Even the shortcomings of the book contributed to its immediate effect. Its literary, sometimes even high-flown, style secured for it a large public and was at any rate refreshing after long years of abstract and abstruse Hegelianizing. The same is true of its extravagant deification of love, which, coming after the now intolerable sovereign rule of “pure reason”, had its excuse, if not justification. But what we must not forget is that it was precisely these two weaknesses of Feuerbach that “true Socialism”, which had been spreading like a plague in educated Germany since 1844, took as its starting-point, putting literary phrases in the place of scientific knowledge, the liberation of mankind by means of “love” in place of the emancipation of the proletariat through the economic transformation of production — in short, losing itself in the nauseous fine writing and ecstacies of love typified by Herr Karl Grun.

Another thing we must not forget is this: the Hegelian school disintegrated, but Hegelian philosophy was not overcome through criticism; Strauss and Bauer each took one of its sides and set it polemically against the other. Feuerbach smashed the system and simply discarded it. But a philosophy is not disposed of by the mere assertion that it is false. And so powerful a work as Hegelian philosophy, which had exercised so enormous an influence on the intellectual development of the nation, could not be disposed of by simply being ignored. It had to be “sublated” in its own sense, that is, in the sense that while its form had to be annihilatedhrough criticism, the new content which had been won through it had to be saved. How this was brought about we shall see below.

But in the meantime, the Revolution of 1848 thrust the whole of philosophy aside as unceremoniously as Feuerbach had thrust aside Hegel. And in the process, Feuerbach himself was also pushed into the background.

### Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy in General

||XI| (6) This is perhaps the place at which, by way of explanation and justification, we might offer some considerations in regard to the Hegelian dialectic generally and especially its exposition in the _Phänomenologie_ and _Logik_ and also, lastly, the relation (to it) of the modern critical movement.[['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn42)

So powerful was modern German criticism’s preoccupation with the past – so completely was its development entangled with the subject-matter – that here prevailed a completely uncritical attitude to the method of criticising, together with a complete lack of awareness about the _apparently formal_, but really _vital_ question: how do we now stand as regards the Hegelian _dialectic?_ This lack of awareness about the relationship of modern criticism to the Hegelian philosophy as a whole and especially to the Hegelian dialectic has been so great that critics like _Strauss_ and _Bruno Bauer_ still remain within the confines of the Hegelian logic; the former completely so and the latter at least implicitly so in his _Synoptiker_ (where, in opposition to Strauss, he replaces the substance of “abstract nature” by the “self-consciousness” of abstract man), and even in _Das entdeckte Christenthum._ Thus in _Das entdeckte Christenthum,_ for example, you get:

“As though in positing the world, self-consciousness does not posit that which is different [from itself] and in what it is creating it does not create itself, since it in turn annuls the difference between what it has created and itself, since it itself has being only in creating and in the movement – as though its purpose were not this movement?” etc.; or again: “They” (the French materialists) “have not yet been able to see that it is only as the movement of self-consciousness that the movement of the universe has actually come to be for itself, and achieved unity with itself.” [Pp. 113, 114-15.]

Such expressions do not even show any verbal divergence from the Hegelian approach, but on the contrary repeat it word for word.

||XII| How little consciousness there was in relation to the Hegelian dialectic during the act of criticism (Bauer, the _Synoptiker_), and how little this consciousness came into being even after the act of material criticism, is proved by Bauer when, in his _Die gute Sache der Freiheit,_ he dismisses the brash question put by Herr Gruppe – “What about logic now?” – by referring him to future critics.[[Brev Til Kongressen (Testamentet)-1721243498777.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn43)

But even now – now that _Feuerbach_ both in his _Thesen_ in the _Anekdota_ and, in detail, in the _Philosophie der Zukunft_ has in principle overthrown the old dialectic and philosophy; now that that school of criticism, on the other hand, which was incapable of accomplishing this, has all the same seen it accomplished and has proclaimed itself pure, resolute, absolute criticism that has come into the clear with itself; now that this criticism, in its spiritual pride, has reduced the whole process of history to the relation between the rest of the world and itself (the rest of the world, in contrast to itself, falling under the category of “the masses”) and dissolved all dogmatic antitheses into the _single_ dogmatic antithesis of its own cleverness and the stupidity of the world – the antithesis of the critical Christ and Mankind, the “_rabble_”; now that daily and hourly it has demonstrated its own excellence against the dullness of the masses; now, finally, that it has proclaimed the critical _Last Judgment_ in the shape of an announcement that the day is approaching when the whole of decadent humanity will assemble before it and be sorted by it into groups, each particular mob receiving its _testimonium paupertatis_; now that it has made known in print its superiority to human feelings as well as its superiority to the world, over which it sits enthroned in sublime solitude, only letting fall from time to time from its sarcastic lips the ringing laughter of the Olympian Gods – even now, after all these delightful antics of idealism (i.e., of Young Hegelianism) expiring in the guise of criticism – even now it has not expressed the suspicion that the time was ripe for a critical settling of accounts with the mother of Young Hegelianism – the Hegelian dialectic – and even had nothing to say about its critical attitude towards the Feuerbachian dialectic. This shows a completely uncritical attitude to itself.

_Feuerbach_ is the only one who has a _serious, critical_ attitude to the Hegelian dialectic and who has made genuine discoveries in this field. He is in fact the true conqueror of the old philosophy. The extent of his achievement, and the unpretentious simplicity with which he, Feuerbach, gives it to the world, stand in striking contrast to the opposite attitude [of the others].

Feuerbach’s great achievement is:

**(1)** The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thought and expounded by thought, i.e., another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man; hence equally to be condemned;

**(2)** The establishment of _true materialism_ and of _real science,_ by making the social relationship of “man to man” the basic principle of the theory;

**(3)** His opposing to the negation of the negation, which claims to be the absolute positive, the self-supporting positive, positively based on itself.

Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic (and thereby justifies starting out from the positive facts which we know by the senses) as follows:

Hegel sets out from the estrangement of substance (in logic, from the infinite, abstractly universal) – from the absolute and fixed abstraction; which means, put popularly, that he sets out from religion and theology.

_Secondly_, he annuls the infinite, and posits the actual, sensuous, real, finite, particular (philosophy, annulment of religion and theology).

_Thirdly_, he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction, the infinite – restoration of religion and theology.

Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation _only_ as a contradiction of philosophy with itself – as the philosophy which affirms theology (the transcendent, etc.) after having denied it, and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself.

The positive position or self-affirmation and self-confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself, which is therefore burdened with its opposite, which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof, and which, therefore, is not a position demonstrating itself by its existence – not an acknowledged ||XIII| position; hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the position of sense-certainty based on itself. [Feuerbach also defines the negation of the negation, the definite concept, as thinking surpassing itself in thinking and as thinking wanting to be directly awareness, nature, reality. – _Note by Marx_ [[44]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn44)]

But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation, from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it, as the true and only positive, and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and spontaneous activity of all being, he has only found the _abstract, logical, speculative_ expression for the movement of history, which is not yet the _real_ history of man as a given subject, but only the _act of creation,_ the _history of the origin_ of man.

We shall explain both the abstract form of this process and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism, in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach’s _Wesen des Christenthums,_ or rather the _critical_ form of this in Hegel still uncritical process.

Let us take a look at the Hegelian system. One must begin with Hegel’s _Phänomenologie,_ the true point of origin and the secret of the Hegelian philosophy.

_**Phenomenology.**_

**A. _Self-consciousness._**

**I**. _Consciousness_. (a) Certainty at the level of sense-experience; or the “this” and _meaning_. (b) _Perception_, or the thing with its properties, and _deception._ (g) Force and understanding, appearance and the supersensible world.

**II**. _Self-consciousness._ The truth of certainty of self. (a) Independence and dependence of self-consciousness; mastery and servitude. (b) Freedom of self-consciousness. Stoicism, scepticism, the unhappy consciousness.

**III**. _Reason_. Reason’s certainty and reason’s truth. (a) Observation as a process of reason. Observation of nature and of self-consciousness. (b) Realisation of rational self-consciousness through its own activity. Pleasure and necessity. The law of the heart and the insanity of self-conceit. Virtue and the course of the world. (c) The individuality which is real in and for itself. The spiritual animal kingdom and the deception or the real fact. Reason as lawgiver. Reason which tests laws.

**B. _Mind._**

**I**. _True_ mind, ethics. **II**. Mind in self-estrangement, culture. **III**. Mind certain of itself, morality.

**C. Religion.** _Natural_ religion; _religion of art; revealed_ religion.

**D. _Absolute knowledge._**

Hegel’s _Encyklopädie_, beginning as it does with logic, with _pure speculative thought,_ and ending with _absolute knowledge_ – with the self-conscious, self-comprehending philosophic or absolute (i.e., superhuman) abstract mind – is in its entirety nothing but the _display,_ the self-objectification, of the _essence_ of the philosophic mind, and the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self-estrangement – i.e., comprehending itself abstractly.

_Logic_ – mind’s _coin of the realm_, the speculative or _mental value_ of man and nature – its essence which has grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness, and hence unreal – is _alienated thinking,_ and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man: _abstract_ thinking.

Then: _The externality of this abstract thinking_ ... _nature,_ as it is for this abstract thinking. Nature is external to it – its self-loss; and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion, as abstract thought, but as alienated abstract thinking. Finally, _mind_, this thinking returning home to its own point of origin – the thinking which as the anthropological, phenomenological, psychological, ethical, artistic and religious mind is not valid for itself, until ultimately it finds itself, and affirms itself, as _absolute_ knowledge and hence absolute, i.e., abstract, mind, thus receiving its conscious embodiment in the mode of existence corresponding to it. For its real mode of existence is _abstraction._

There is a double error in Hegel.

The **first** emerges most clearly in the _Phänomenologie_, the birth-place of the Hegelian philosophy. When, for instance, wealth, state-power, etc., are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the _human_ being, this only happens in their form as thoughts ... They are thought-entities, and therefore merely an estrangement of _pure_, i.e., abstract, philosophical thinking. The whole process therefore ends with absolute knowledge. It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their presumption of reality. The _philosopher_ – who is himself an abstract form of estranged man – takes himself as the _criterion_ of the estranged world. The whole _history of the alienation process_ [_Entäußerungsgeschichte_] and the whole _process of the retraction_ of the alienation is therefore nothing but the _history of the production_ of abstract (i.e., absolute) ||XVII|[[Den amerikanske oppositions opgaver-1721247664578.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn45) thought – of logical, speculative thought. The _estrangement_, [_Entfremdung_] which therefore forms the real interest of the transcendence [_Aufhebung_] of this alienation [_Entäußerung_], is the opposition of _in itself_ and _for itself_, of _consciousness and self-consciousness_, of _object and subject_ – that is to say, it is the opposition between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness within thought itself. All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the _semblance_, the _cloak_, the _exoteric_ shape of these oppositions which alone matter, and which constitute the _meaning_ of these other, profane oppositions. It is not the fact that the human being _objectifies himself inhumanly_, in opposition to himself, but the fact that he _objectifies himself_ [_selbst sich vergegenständlicht_] in _distinction_ from and in _opposition_ to abstract thinking, that constitutes the posited essence of the estrangement [_Entfremdung_] and the thing to be superseded [_aufzuhebende_].

||XVIII| The appropriation of man’s essential powers, which have become objects – indeed, alien objects – is thus in the _first place_ only an _appropriation_ occurring in _consciousness_, in _pure thought,_ i.e., in _abstraction:_ it is the appropriation of these objects as _thoughts_ and as _movements of thought_. Consequently, despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the genuine criticism contained in it, which often anticipates far later development, there is already latent in the _Phänomenologie_ as a germ, a potentiality, a secret, the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel’s later works – that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world.

_In the **second** place_: the vindication of the objective world for man – for example, the realisation that _sensuous_ consciousness is not an _abstractly_ sensuous consciousness but a _humanly_ sensuous consciousness, that religion, wealth, etc., are but the estranged world of _human_ objectification, of _man’s_ essential powers put to work and that they are therefore but the _path_ to the true _human_ world – this appropriation or the insight into this process appears in Hegel therefore in this form, that _sense, religion,_ state power, etc., are _spiritual_ entities; for only _mind_ is the _true_ essence of man, and the true form of mind is thinking mind, theological, speculative mind.

The _human character_ of nature and of the nature created by history – man’s products – appears in the form that they are _products_ of abstract mind and as such, therefore, phases of _mind_ – _thought-entities_. The _Phänomenologie_ is, therefore, a hidden, mystifying and still uncertain criticism; but inasmuch as it depicts man’s _estrangement_, even though man appears only as mind, there lie concealed in it _all_ the elements of criticism, already _prepared_ and _elaborated_ in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint. The “unhappy consciousness”, the “honest consciousness”, the struggle of the “noble and base consciousness”, etc., etc. – these separate sections contain, but still in an estranged form, the _critical_ elements of whole spheres such as religion, the state, civil life, etc. Just as _entities, objects,_ appear as thought-entities, so the _subject_ is always _consciousness_ or _self-consciousness;_ or rather the object appears only as _abstract_ consciousness, man only as _self-consciousness:_ the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are, therefore, only various forms of consciousness and self-consciousness. Just as _in itself_ abstract consciousness (the form in which the object is conceived) is merely a moment of distinction of self-consciousness, what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self-consciousness with consciousness – absolute knowledge – the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but proceeding now only within its own self: that is to say, the dialectic of pure thought is the result. |XVIII||

||XXIII| [[Den dialektiske materialismes ABC-1721248246487.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn46) The outstanding achievement of Hegel’s _Phänomenologie_ and of its final outcome, the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle, is thus first that Hegel conceives the self-creation of man as a process, conceives objectification as loss of the object, as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation; that he thus grasps the essence of _labour_ and comprehends objective man – true, because real man – as the outcome of man’s _own labour_. The _real, active_ orientation of man to himself as a species-being, or his manifestation as a real species-being (i.e., as a human being), is only possible if he really brings out all his _species-powers_ – something which in turn is only possible through the cooperative action of all of mankind, only as the result of history – and treats these powers as objects: and this, to begin with, is again only possible in the form of estrangement.

We shall now demonstrate in detail Hegel’s one-sidedness and limitations as they are displayed in the final chapter of the _Phänomenologie,_ “Absolute Knowledge” – a chapter which contains the condensed spirit of the _Phänomenologie,_ the relationship of the _Phänomenologie_ to speculative dialectic, and also Hegel’s _consciousness_ concerning both and their relationship to one another.

Let us provisionally say just this much in advance: Hegel’s standpoint is that of modern political economy. [['Du' og 'De' i Den røde Hær-1721247142810.pdf]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn47) He grasps _labour_ as the _essence_ of man – as man’s essence which stands the test: he sees only the positive, not the negative side of labour. Labour is _man’s coming-to-be_ for _himself_ within _alienation_, or as _alienated_ man. The only labour which Hegel knows and recognises is _abstractly mental_ labour. Therefore, that which constitutes the _essence_ of philosophy – the _alienation of man who knows himself_, or _alienated_ science _thinking itself_ - Hegel grasps as its essence; and in contradistinction to previous philosophy he is therefore able to combine its separate aspects, and to present his philosophy as _the_ philosophy. What the other philosophers did – that they grasped separate phases of nature and of abstract self-consciousness, namely, of human life as phases of self-consciousness – is _known_ to Hegel as the _doings_ of philosophy. Hence his science is absolute.

Let us now turn to our subject.

_“Absolute Knowledge”. The last chapter of the “Phänomenologie”._

The main point is that the _object of consciousness_ is nothing else but _self-consciousness,_ or that the object is only _objectified self-consciousness_ – self-consciousness as object. (Positing of man = self-consciousness).

The issue, therefore, is to surmount the _object of consciousness. Objectivity_ as such is regarded as an _estranged_ human relationship which does not correspond to the _essence of man,_ to self-consciousness. The _reappropriation_ of the objective essence of man, produced within the orbit of estrangement as something alien, therefore denotes not only the annulment of _estrangement,_ but of _objectivity_ as well. Man, that is to say, is regarded as a _non-objective, spiritual_ being.

The movement of _surmounting the object of consciousness_ is now described by Hegel in the following way:

The _object_ reveals itself not merely as _returning_ into the _self –_ this is according to Hegel the _one-sided_ way of apprehending this movement, the grasping of only one side. Man is equated with self. The self, however, is only the _abstractly_ conceived man – man created by abstraction. Man _is_ selfish. His eye, his ear, etc., are _selfish_. In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of _selfhood_. But it is quite false to say on that account “_self-consciousness_ has eyes, ears, essential powers”. _Self-consciousness_ is rather a quality of human nature, of the human eye, etc.; it is not human nature that is a quality of ||XXIV| _self-consciousness._

The self-abstracted entity, fixed for itself, is man as _abstract egoist – egoism_ raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought. (We shall return to this point later.)

For Hegel the _human being_ – _man_ – equals _self-consciousness_. All estrangement of the human being is therefore _nothing_ but _estrangement of self-consciousness._ The estrangement of self-consciousness is not regarded as an _expression_ – reflected in the realm of knowledge and thought – of the _real_ estrangement of the human being. Instead, the _actual_ estrangement – that which appears real – is according to its _innermost_, hidden nature (which is only brought to light by philosophy) nothing but the _manifestation_ of the estrangement of the real human essence, of _self-consciousness_. The science which comprehends this is therefore called _phenomenology_. All reappropriation of the estranged objective essence appears therefore, as incorporation into self-consciousness: The man who takes hold of his essential being is _merely_ the self-consciousness which takes hold of objective essences. Return of the object into the self is therefore the reappropriation of the object.

Expressed in _all its aspects_, the _surmounting of the object of consciousness_ means:

(1) That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing.

(2) That it is the alienation of self-consciousness which posits thinghood.[[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn48)

(3) That this alienation has, not merely a _negative_ but _a positive_ significance

(4) That it has this meaning not merely _for us_ or intrinsically, but _for self-consciousness itself._

(5) _For self-consciousness,_ the negative of the object, or its annulling of itself, has _positive_ significance – or it _knows_ this futility of the object – because of the fact that it alienates itself, for in this alienation it posits _itself_ as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of _being-for-self_, posits the object as itself.

(6) On the other hand, this contains likewise the other moment, that self-consciousness has also just as much superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus _at home_ in _its_ other-being _as such._

(7) This is the movement of consciousness and this is therefore the totality of its moments.

(8) Consciousness must similarly be related to the object in the totality of its determinations and have comprehended it in terms of each of them. This totality of its determinations makes the object _intrinsically a spiritual being;_ and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each one of the determinations as _self_, or through what was called above the _spiritual_ attitude to them. [[Marx og »Neue Rheinische Zeitung« (1848-49) (Ikke oversat)]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn49)

As to (1): That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing – this is the above-mentioned _return of the object into the self._

As to (2): The _alienation of self-consciousness_ posits _thinghood_. Because man equals self-consciousness, his alienated, objective essence, or _thinghood_, equals _alienated self-consciousness_, and _thinghood_ is thus posited through this alienation (thinghood being _that_ which is an _object for man_ and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object, therefore his _objective_ essence. And since it is not _real man,_ nor therefore _nature_ – man being _human nature_ – who as such is made the subject, but only the abstraction of man – self-consciousness – thinghood cannot be anything but alienated self-consciousness). It is only to be expected that a living, natural being equipped and endowed with objective (i.e., material) essential powers should have real natural objects of his essence; and that his self-alienation should lead to the positing of a _real_, objective world, but within the framework of _externality,_ and, therefore, an overwhelming world not belonging to his own essential being. There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this. It would be mysterious, rather, if it were otherwise. But it is equally clear that a _self-consciousness_ by its alienation can posit only _thinghood,_ i.e., only an abstract thing, a thing of abstraction and not a _real_ thing. It is ||XXVI| [[Henvendelse fra centralledelsen til forbundet, Marts 1850]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn50) clear, further, that thinghood is therefore utterly without any _independence_, any _essentiality_ vis-à-vis self-consciousness; that on the contrary it is a mere creature – something _posited_ by self-consciousness. And what is posited, instead of confirming itself, is but confirmation of the act of positing which for a moment fixes its energy as the product, and gives it the _semblance_ – but only for a moment – of an independent, real substance.

|| Whenever real, corporeal _man_, man with his feet firmly on the solid ground, man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature, _posits_ his real, objective _essential powers_ as alien objects by his externalisation, it is not the _act of positing_ which is the subject in this process: it is the subjectivity of _objective_ essential powers, whose action, therefore, must also be something objective. An objective being acts objectively, and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being. He only creates or posits objects, because he is posited by objects – because at bottom he is _nature_. In the act of positing, therefore, this objective being does not fall from his state of “pure activity” into _a creating of the object_; on the contrary, his _objective_ product only confirms his _objective_ activity, his activity as the activity of an objective, natural being.

Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism is distinct from both idealism and materialism, and constitutes at the same time the unifying truth of both. We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the action of world history.

<_Man_ is directly a _natural being._ As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand endowed with _natural powers, vital powers_ – he is an _active_ natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities – as _instincts._ On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous objective being he is a _suffering,_ conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the _objects_ of his instincts exist outside him, as _objects_ independent of him; yet these objects are _objects_ that he _needs_ – essential _objects,_ indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers. To say that man is a _corporeal_, living, real, sensuous, objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has _real, sensuous objects_ as the object of his being or of his life, or that he can only _express_ his life in real, sensuous objects. _To be_ objective, natural and sensuous, and at the same time to have object, nature and sense outside oneself, or oneself to be object, nature and sense for a third party, is one and the same thing.>

_Hunger_ is a natural _need;_ it therefore needs a _nature_ outside itself, an _object_ outside itself, in order to satisfy itself, to be stilled. Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an _object_ existing outside it, indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being. The sun is the _object_ of the plant – an indispensable object to it, confirming its life – just as the plant is an object of the sun, being an _expression_ of the life-awakening power of the sun, of the sun’s _objective es_sential power.

A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a _natural_ being, and plays no part in the system of nature. A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being. A being which is not itself an object for some third being has no being for its _object;_ i.e., it is not objectively related. Its being is not objective.

||XXVII| A non-objective being is a _non-being._

Suppose a being which is neither an object itself, nor has an object. Such a being, in the first place, would be the _unique_ being: there would exist no being outside it – it would exist solitary and alone. For as soon as there are objects outside me, as soon as I am not _alone,_ I am _another – another reality_ than the object outside me. For this third object I am thus a _different reality_ than itself; that is, I am _its_ object. Thus, to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that _no_ objective being exists. As soon as I have an object, this object has me for an object. But a _non-objective_ being is an unreal, non-sensuous thing – a product of mere thought (i.e., of mere imagination) – an abstraction. To be _sensuous_, that is, to be really existing, means to be an object of sense, to be a _sensuous_ object, to have sensuous objects outside oneself – objects of one’s sensuousness. To be sensuous is to _suffer._

Man as an objective, sensuous being is therefore a _suffering_ being – and because he feels that he suffers, a _passionate_ being. Passion is the essential power of man energetically bent on its object.

<But man is not merely a natural being: he is a _human_ natural being. That is to say, he is a being for himself. Therefore he is a _species-being,_ and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing. Therefore, _human_ objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves, and neither is _human sense_ as it immediately _is_ – as it is objectively – _human_ sensibility, human objectivity. Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the _human_ being.> And as everything natural has to _come into being,_ _man_ too has his act of origin – _history_ – which, however, is for him a known history, and hence as an act of origin it is a conscious self-transcending act of origin. History is the true natural history of man (on which more later).

Thirdly, because this positing of thinghood is itself only an illusion, an act contradicting the nature of pure activity, it has to be cancelled again and thinghood denied.

_Re 3, 4, 5 and 6_. (3) This externalisation [_Entäußerung_] of consciousness has not merely a _negative_ but a _positive_ significance, and (4) it has this meaning not merely _for us_ or intrinsically, but for consciousness itself. _For consciousness_ the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has _positive_ significance – i.e., consciousness _knows_ this nullity of the object – because it alienates _itself;_ for, in this alienation it _knows_ itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of _being-for-itself,_ the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that consciousness has also just as much superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus _at home_ in its _other-being_ _as such._

As we have already seen, the appropriation of what is estranged and objective, or the annulling of objectivity in the form of _estrangement_ (which has to advance from indifferent strangeness to real, antagonistic estrangement), means likewise or even primarily for Hegel that it is _objectivity_ which is to be annulled, because it is not the _determinate_ character of the object, but rather its _objective_ character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self-consciousness. The object is therefore something negative, self-annulling – a _nullity_. This nullity of the object has not only a negative but a _positive_ meaning for consciousness, since this nullity of the object is precisely the _self-confirmation_ of the non-objectivity, of the ||XXVIII| _abstraction_ of itself. For _consciousness itself_ the nullity of the object has a positive meaning because it _knows_ this nullity, the objective being, as _its self-alienation;_ because it knows that it exists only as a result of its own self-alienation....

The way in which consciousness is, and in which something is for it, is _knowing._ Knowing is its sole act. Something therefore comes to be for consciousness insofar as the latter _knows_ this _something._ Knowing is its sole objective relation.

It ,consciousness, then, knows the nullity of the object (i.e., knows the non-existence of the distinction between the object and itself, the non-existence of the object for it) because it knows the object as its _self-alienation;_ that is, it knows itself – knows knowing as object – because the object is only the _semblance_ of an object, a piece of mystification, which in its essence, however, is nothing else but knowing itself, which has confronted itself with itself and hence has confronted itself with a _nullity_ – a something which has _no_ objectivity outside the knowing. Or: knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only _outside_ itself – that it only externalises itself; that _it itself_ only _appears_ to itself as an object – or that that which appears to it as an object is only itself.

On the other hand, says Hegel, there is here at the same time this other moment, that consciousness has just as much annulled and reabsorbed this externalisation and objectivity, being thus _at home_ in its _other-being as such._

In this discussion all the illusions of speculation are brought together.

_First of all_: consciousness, self-consciousness, is _at home_ in _its other-being as such._ It is therefore – or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self-consciousness of man instead of self-consciousness – it is _at home_ in its _other being_ _as such._ This implies, for one thing, that consciousness (knowing as knowing, thinking as thinking) pretends to be directly the _other_ of itself – to be the world of sense, the real world, life – thought surpassing itself in thought (Feuerbach).[[51]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn51) This aspect is contained herein, inasmuch as consciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity, but at _objectivity as such._

Secondly, this implies that self-conscious man, insofar as he has recognised and superseded the spiritual world (or his world’s spiritual, general mode of being) as self-alienation, nevertheless again confirms it in this alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being – re-establishes it, and pretends to be _at home in his other-being as such._ Thus, for instance, after superseding religion, after recognising religion to be a product of self-alienation he yet finds confirmation of himself in _religion as religion._ Here _is_ the root of Hegel’s _false_ positivism, or of his merely _apparent_ criticism: this is what Feuerbach designated as [the positing, negating and re-establishing of religion or theology](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/feuerbach/works/future/future1.htm#21b) – but it has to be expressed in more general terms. Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason. The man who has recognised that he is leading an alienated life in law, politics, etc., is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such. Self-affirmation, self-confirmation _in contradiction_ with itself – in contradiction both with the knowledge of and with the essential being of the object – is thus true _knowledge_ and _life._

There can therefore no longer be any question about an act of accommodation on Hegel’s part _vis-à-vis_ religion, the state, etc., since this lie is the lie of his principle.

||XXIX| If I _know_ religion as _alienated_ human self-consciousness, then what I know in it as religion is not my self-consciousness, but my alienated self-consciousness confirmed in it. I therefore know my self-consciousness that belongs to itself, to its very nature, confirmed not in _religion_ but rather in _annihilated_ and _superseded_ religion.

In Hegel, therefore, the negation of the negation is not the confirmation of the true essence, effected precisely through negation of the pseudo-essence. With him the negation of the negation is the confirmation of the pseudo-essence, or of the self-estranged essence in its denial; or it is the denial of this pseudo-essence as an objective being dwelling outside man and independent of him, and its transformation into the subject.

A peculiar role, therefore, is played by the act of _superseding_ in which denial and preservation, i.e., affirmation, are bound together.

Thus, for example, in Hegel’s philosophy of law, _civil law_ superseded equals _morality_, morality superseded equals the _family,_ the family superseded equals _civil society,_ civil society superseded equals the _state,_ the state superseded equals _world history._ In the _actual world_ civil law, morality, the family, civil society, the state, etc., remain in existence, only they have become _moments_ – states of the existence and being of man – which have no validity in isolation, but dissolve and engender one another, etc. They have become _moments of motion._

In their actual existence this _mobile_ nature of theirs is hidden. It appears and is made manifest only in thought, in philosophy. Hence my true religious existence is my existence in the _philosophy of religion;_ my true political existence is my existence in the _philosophy of law;_ my true natural existence, existence in the _philosophy of nature;_ my true artistic existence, existence in the _philosophy of art_; my true _human_ existence, my _existence in philosophy._ Likewise the true existence of religion, the state, nature, art, is the _philosophy_ of religion, of nature, of the state and of art. If, however, the philosophy of religion, etc., is for me the sole true existence of religion then, too, it is only as a _philosopher of religion_ that I am truly religious, and so I deny _real_ religious sentiment and the really _religious_ man. But at the same time I _assert_ them, in part within my own existence or within the alien existence which I oppose to them – for this _is_ only their _philosophic_ expression – and in part I assert them in their distinct original shape, since for me they represent merely the _apparent_ other-being, allegories, forms of their own true existence (i.e., of my _philosophical_ existence) hidden under sensuous disguises.

In just the same way, _quality_ superseded equals _quantity,_ quantity superseded equals _measure,_ measure superseded equals _essence,_ essence superseded equals _appearance,_ appearance superseded equals _actuality,_ actuality superseded equals the _concept,_ the concept superseded equals _objectivity_, objectivity superseded equals the _absolute idea,_ the absolute idea superseded equals _nature_, nature superseded equals _subjective_ mind, subjective mind superseded equals _ethical_ objective mind, ethical mind superseded equals _art_, art superseded equals _religion_, religion superseded equals _absolute knowledge._[[52]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn52)

On the one hand, this act of superseding is a transcending of a conceptual entity; thus, private property _as a concept_ is transcended in the _concept_ of morality. And because thought imagines itself to be directly the other of itself, to be _sensuous reality_ – and therefore takes its own action for _sensuous, real_ action – this superseding in thought, which leaves its object in existence in the real world, believes that it has really overcome it. On the other hand, because the object has now become for it a moment of thought, thought takes it in its reality too to be self-confirmation of itself – of self-consciousness, of abstraction.

||XXX| From the one point of view the entity which Hegel _supersedes_ in philosophy is therefore not _real_ religion, the _real_ state, or _real_ nature, but religion itself already as an object of knowledge, i.e., _dogmatics;_ the same with _jurisprudence, political science_ and _natural science._ From the one point of view, therefore, he stands in opposition both to the _real_ thing and to immediate, unphilosophic _science_ or the unphilosophic _conceptions_ of this thing. He therefore contradicts their conventional conceptions. [The conventional conception of theology, jurisprudence, political science, natural science, etc. - Ed.]

On the other hand, the religious, etc., man can find in Hegel his final confirmation.

It is now time to formulate the _positive_ aspects of the Hegelian dialectic within the realm of estrangement.

(a) _Supersession_ as an objective movement of _retracting_ the alienation _into self_. This is the insight, expressed within the estrangement, concerning the _appropriation_ of the objective essence through the supersession of its estrangement; it is the estranged insight into the _real objectification_ of man, into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the _estranged_ character of the objective world, through the supersession of the objective world in its estranged mode of being. In the same way atheism, being the supersession of God, is the advent of theoretic humanism, and communism, as the supersession of private property, is the vindication of real human life as man’s possession and thus the advent of practical humanism, or atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of religion, whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of private property. Only through the supersession of this mediation – which is itself, however, a necessary premise – does positively self-deriving humanism, _positive_ humanism, come into being.

But atheism and communism are no flight, no abstraction, no loss of the objective world created by man – of man’s essential powers born to the realm of objectivity; they are not a returning in poverty to unnatural, primitive simplicity. On the contrary, they are but the first real emergence, the actual realisation for man of man’s essence and of his essence as something real.

Thus, by grasping the _positive_ meaning of self-referred negation (although again in estranged fashion) Hegel grasps man’s self-estrangement, the alienation of man’s essence, man’s loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as self-discovery, manifestation of his nature, objectification and realisation. <In short, within the sphere of abstraction, Hegel conceives labour as man’s act of _self-genesis_ – conceives man’s relation to himself as an alien being and the manifestation of himself as an alien being to be the emergence of _species-consciousness_ and _species-life_.>

(b) However, apart from, or rather in consequence of, the referral already described, this act appears in Hegel:

First as a _merely formal,_ because abstract, act, because the human being itself is taken to be only an _abstract, thinking being,_ conceived merely as self-consciousness. And,

Secondly, because the exposition is _formal_ and _abstract,_ the supersession of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation; or for Hegel this movement of _self-genesis_ and _self-objectification_ in the form of _self-alienation and self-estrangement_ is the _absolute,_ and hence final, _expression of human life_ – of life with itself as its aim, of life at peace with itself, and in unity with its essence.

This movement, in its abstract ||XXXI| form as dialectic, is therefore regarded as _truly human life,_ and because it is nevertheless an abstraction – an estrangement of human life – it is regarded as a _divine process,_ but as the divine process of man, a process traversed by man’s abstract, pure, absolute essence that is distinct from himself.

_Thirdly_, this process must have a bearer, a subject. But the subject only comes into being as a result. This result – the subject knowing itself as absolute self-consciousness – is therefore _God, absolute Spirit, the self-knowing and self-manifesting idea._ Real man and real nature become mere predicates – symbols of this hidden, unreal man and of this unreal nature. Subject and predicate are therefore related to each other in absolute reversal – a _mystical subject-object_ or a _subjectivity reaching beyond the object_ – the _absolute subject_ as a _process_, as _subject alienating_ itself and returning from alienation into itself, but at the same time retracting this alienation into itself, and the subject as this process; a pure, _incessant_ revolving within itself.

_First. Formal and abstract_ conception of man’s act of self-creation or self-objectification.

Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self-consciousness, the estranged object – the estranged essential reality of man – is nothing but _consciousness,_ the thought of estrangement merely – estrangement’s _abstract_ and therefore empty and unreal expression, _negation_. The supersession of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract, empty supersession of that empty abstraction – the _negation of the negation._ The rich, living, sensuous, concrete activity of self-objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction, _absolute negativity –_ an abstraction which is again fixed as such and considered as an independent activity – as sheer activity. Because this so-called negativity is nothing but the _abstract, empty_ form of that real living act, its content can in consequence be merely a _formal_ content produced by abstraction from all content. As a result therefore one gets general, abstract _forms of abstraction_ pertaining to every content and on that account indifferent to, and, consequently, valid for, all content – the thought-forms or logical categories torn from _real_ mind and from _real_ nature. (We shall unfold the _logical_ content of absolute negativity further on.)

| Hegel’s positive achievement here, in his speculative logic, is that the _definite concepts,_ the universal _fixed thought-forms_ in their independence _vis-à-vis_ nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human being and therefore also of a human thought, and that Hegel has therefore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction-process. For example, superseded being is essence, superseded essence is concept, the concept superseded is ... absolute idea. But what, then, is the absolute idea? It supersedes its own self again, if it does not want to traverse once more from the beginning the whole act of abstraction, and to satisfy itself with being a totality of abstractions or the self-comprehending abstraction. But abstraction comprehending itself as abstraction knows itself to be nothing: it must abandon itself – abandon abstraction – and so it arrives at an entity which is its exact opposite – at _nature_. Thus, the entire logic is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself; that the absolute idea is nothing for itself; that only _nature is_ something.

||XXXII| The absolute idea, the abstract idea, which

“_considered_ with regard to its unity with itself is _intuiting_ ([_Logic_ § 244](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slidea.htm#SL244)), and which (_loc. cit._) “in its own absolute truth _resolves_ to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterisation and other-being, the _immediate idea,_ as its reflection, _go forth_ freely _from itself as nature_” (loc. cit.),

this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and bizarre way, and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches, is from beginning to end nothing else but _abstraction_ (i.e., the abstract thinker), which, made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth, resolves under various (false and themselves still abstract) conditions to _abandon itself_ and to replace its self-absorption, nothingness, generality and indeterminateness by its other-being, the particular, and the determinate; resolves to let _nature,_ which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction, as a thought-entity, _go forth freely from itself_; that is to say, this idea resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature _free_ of abstraction. The abstract idea, which without mediation becomes _intuiting_, is indeed nothing else but abstract thinking that gives itself up and resolves on _intuition._ This entire transition from logic to natural philosophy is nothing else but the transition – so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker, who therefore describes it in such an adventurous way – from _abstracting_ to _intuiting._ The _mystical_ feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is _boredom_ – the longing for content.

(The man estranged from himself is also the thinker estranged from his _essence_ – that is, from the natural and human essence. His thoughts are therefore fixed mental forms dwelling outside nature and man. Hegel has locked up all these fixed mental forms together in his logic, interpreting each of them first as negation – that is, as an _alienation_ of _human_ thought – and then as negation of the negation – that is, as a superseding of this alienation, as a _real_ expression of human thought. But as this still takes place within the confines of the estrangement, this negation of the negation is in part the restoring of these fixed forms in their estrangement; in part a stopping at the last act – the act of self-reference in alienation – as the true mode of being of these fixed mental forms; * –

[* (This means that what Hegel does is to put in place of these fixed abstractions the act of abstraction which revolves in its own circle. We must therefore give him the credit for having indicated the source of all these inappropriate concepts which originally appertained to particular philosophers; for having brought them together; and for having created the entire compass of abstraction as the object of criticism, instead of some specific abstraction.) (Why Hegel separates thought from the _subject_ we shall see later; at this stage it is already clear, however, that when man is not, his characteristic expression cannot be human either, and so neither could thought be grasped as an expression of man as a human and natural subject endowed with eyes, ears, etc., and living in society, in the world, and in nature.) – Note by Marx]

– and in part, to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself, there makes its appearance in Hegel, in the form of the resolution to recognise _nature_ as the essential being and to go over to intuition, the abandonment of abstract thought – the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought, of thought _sans_ eyes, _sans_ teeth, _sans_ ears, _sans_ everything.)

||XXXIII| But _nature_ too, taken abstractly, for itself – nature fixed in isolation from man – is _nothing_ for man. It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting, intuits nature abstractly. Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea, in the form of a thought-entity – in a shape which was obscure and enigmatic even to him – so by letting it emerge from himself he has really let emerge only this _abstract nature,_ only nature as a _thought-entity_ – but now with the significance that it is the other-being of thought, that it is real, intuited nature – nature distinguished from abstract thought. Or, to talk in human language, the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing, from pure abstraction – the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought, for ever shuttling back and forth in itself and never looking outward into reality – are nothing else but _abstractions_ from _characteristics of nature._ To him, therefore, the whole of nature merely repeats the logical abstractions in a sensuous, external form. He once more _resolves_ nature into these abstractions. Thus, his intuition of nature is only the act of confirming his abstraction from the intuition of nature [Let us consider for a moment Hegel’s characteristics of nature and the transition from nature to the mind. Nature has resulted as the idea in the form of the other-being. Since the id ...] – is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of creating his abstraction. Thus, for example, time equals negativity referred to itself (Hegel, _Encyclopädie der philosophischen_ _Wissenschaften im Grundrisse._ p. 238). To the superseded becoming as being there corresponds, in natural form, superseded movement as matter. Light is _reflection-in-itself_, the _natural_ form. Body as _moon_ and _comet_ is the _natural_ form of the _antithesis_ which according to logic is on the one side the _positive resting on itself_ and on the other side the _negative_ resting on itself. The earth is the _natural_ form of the logical _ground,_ as the negative unity of the antithesis, etc.

_Nature as nature_ – that is to say, insofar as it is still sensuously distinguished from that secret sense hidden within it – nature isolated, distinguished from these abstractions is _nothing_ – a _nothing proving itself to be nothing_ – is _devoid of sense,_ or has only the sense of being an externality which has to be annulled.

“In the finite-_teleological_ position is to be found the correct premise that nature does not contain within itself the absolute purpose.” [§245].

Its purpose is the confirmation of abstraction.

“Nature has shown itself to be the idea in the _form of other-being._ Since the _idea_ is in this form the negative of itself or _external to itself,_ nature is not just relatively external _vis-à-vis_ this idea, but _externality_ constitutes the form in which it exists as nature.” [§ 247].

_Externality_ here is not to be understood as the _world of sense_ which _manifests itself_ and is accessible to the light, to the man endowed with senses. It is to be taken here in the sense of alienation, of a mistake, a defect, which ought not to be. For what is true is still the idea. Nature is only the _form_ of the idea’s _other-being._ And since abstract thought is the _essence,_ that which is external to it is by its essence something merely _external._ The abstract thinker recognises at the same time that _sensuousness – externality_ in contrast to thought shuttling back and forth _within itself_ – is the essence of nature. But he expresses this contrast in such a way as to make this _externality of nature_, its _contrast_ to thought, its _defect,_ so that inasmuch as it is distinguished from abstraction, nature is something defective.

||XXXIV| An entity which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself – intrinsically – has something outside itself which it lacks. That is, its essence is different from it itself. Nature has therefore to supersede itself for the abstract thinker, for it is already posited by him as a potentially _superseded_ being.

_“For us,_ mind has _nature_ for its _premise,_ being nature’s _truth_ and for that reason its _absolute prius._ In this truth nature _has vanished,_ and mind has resulted as the idea arrived at being-for-itself, the _object_ of which, as well as the _subject,_ is the _concept._ This identity is _absolute_ _negativity,_ for whereas in nature the concept has its perfect external objectivity, this its alienation has been superseded, and in this alienation the concept has become identical with itself. But it is this identity therefore, only in being a return out of nature.” [§ 381].

“As the _abstract_ idea, _revelation_ is unmediated transition to, the _coming-to-be_ of, nature; as the revelation of the mind, which is free, it is the _positing_ of nature as the _mind’s_ world – a positing which, being reflection, is at the same time, a _presupposing_ of the world as independently existing nature. Revelation in conception is the creation of nature as the mind’s being, in which the mind procures the _affirmation_ and the _truth_ of its freedom.” _“The absolute is mind._ This is the highest definition of the absolute.” [§ 384.] |XXXIV||

DIALECTICAL LOGIC  
Part One - From the History of Dialectics

### 5: Hegel –  
Dialectics as Logic

---

  

Hegel’s solution of the problem of the subject matter of logic has played a special role in the history of this science. In order to understand the Hegelian logic it is not enough just to clarify the direct sense of its propositions. It is more important and difficult to consider the real subject matter through the fanciful turns of Hegel’s style. It is about this that we shall now speak, which will also give us a chance to understand Hegel critically, and to restore for ourselves an image of the original from its distorted presentation. Learning to read Hegel in a materialist way, as Lenin read him and advised reading him, means learning to compare his representation of the object critically with the _**object itself**_, at every step tracing the divergence between the copy and the original.

It would be an easy task if the reader had the two objects of this comparison - the copy and the original - ready-made before him. The copy exists. But where is the original? We cannot take the existing logical consciousness of the scientist as the original, for this consciousness itself must be tested for its logicality, and itself presupposes a critical analysis of existing logical forms from the standpoint of their correspondence with the real requirements of the development of science. And for an understanding of the real forms and laws of theoretical cognition Hegel’s _Science of Logic_, despite all its faults associated with idealism, can offer more than the ‘logic of science’.

The true logic of science is not given to us directly; it still has to be dug out and understood, and then converted into a consciously applied instrument for working with concepts, into a logical method of resolving problems that do not admit of solution by traditional logical methods. That being so, critical study of the _Science of Logic_ cannot be reduced to a simple comparison of its propositions with those of the logic by which scientists are consciously guided, accepting it as irreproachable and admitting of no doubts.

So comparing the copy (the science of logic) with the original (with the actual forms and laws of theoretical understanding) proves to be quite a difficult matter. The difficulty is that Hegel’s presentation of the subject matter (in this case thought) has to be compared critically not with a ready-made, previously known prototype of it, but with an object whose outlines are only beginning to be traced out for the first time in the course of a critical surmounting of the idealist constructions. This reconstruction is feasible if the structure of the optics through which Hegel examined the object of his investigation is clearly understood. This distorting lens, while a magnifying one (the system of the fundamental principles of Hegelian logic) enabled him to see exactly, although in an idealistically distorted form, the _**dialectic**_ of thought, which is the logic that remains invisible to the eye not philosophically equipped, and to simple common sense.

It is important, first of all, to understand clearly what the _**real object**_ was that Hegel investigated and described in his _Science of Logic_, so as to find the critical range immediately in regard to his presentation. ‘That the subject matter of logic is thought, with that everyone agrees,’ Hegel stressed in his [_Shorter Logic_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL2). Later, quite naturally, logic as a science received the definition of _**thinking about thought**_ or thought thinking about itself.

In that definition and the conceptions expressed by it there is still nothing either of the specifically Hegelian or of the specifically idealist. It is simply the traditional ideas of the subject matter of logic as a science, quite clearly and succinctly expressed. In logic the object of scientific comprehension proves to be thought itself, while any other science is thinking about something else. In defining logic as thinking about thought, Hegel quite accurately indicated its sole difference from any other science.

The next question, however, arises from that and requires a no less clear answer. _**But what is thought?**_ It goes without saying, Hegel replied (and one again has to agree with him), that the sole satisfactory answer can only be an exposition of the heart of the matter, i.e. a concretely developed theory, a _**science of thought**_, a ‘science of logic’, and not an ordinary definition. (Compare Engels’ view in _Anti-Duhring_: ‘Our definition of life is naturally very inadequate.... All definitions are of little value. In order to gain an exhaustive knowledge of what life is, we should have to go through all the forms in which it appears, from the lowest to the highest.’ And later: ‘To science definitions are worthless because always inadequate. The only real definition is the development of the thing itself, but this is no longer a definition.’

In any science, however, and therefore in logic too, one has to mark everything out in advance and outline its contours, if only the most general boundaries of the object of investigation, i.e. to indicate the field of the facts to which the given science must devote its attention. Otherwise the criterion for their selection will be unclear and its role will be tyrannous and arbitrary, taking only those facts into consideration that confirm its generalisations, and ignoring everything else as allegedly having no relation to the matter or to the competence of the science concerned. Hegel gave such a _**preliminary**_ explanation, not concealing from the reader exactly what he understood by the word ‘thought’.

This is a very important point, and everything else hangs on proper understanding of it. It is no accident that the main objections to Hegel, both justified and unjustified, have hitherto been directed precisely at it. Neopositivists, for example, unanimously reproach Hegel with having inadmissibly broadened the subject matter of logic by his conception of thought, including in the sphere of examination a mass of ‘things’ that one cannot call thought in the usual and strict sense; above all the concepts traditionally referred to metaphysics, and to ‘ontology’, i.e. to the science of things themselves, the system of categories (the universal definitions of reality outside consciousness, outside subjective thinking understood as the psychic capability of man).

If thinking were to be so understood, the Neopositivist reproach must really be considered reasonable. Hegel actually understood as thought something at first glance enigmatic, even mystical, when he spoke of it as taking place outside man and apart from man, independently of his head, and of ‘thought as such’, of ‘pure thought’, and when he considered the object of logic to be precisely that ‘absolute’ superhuman thought. Logic in his definition must be understood even as having a content that ‘[_**shows forth God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of Nature and of a Finite Spirit**_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlintro.htm#HL1_50)’.

Such definitions are capable of confusing and disorienting at the very start. But of course there is no such ‘thought’ as some superhuman force creating nature, and history, and man himself and his consciousness from itself somewhere in the Universe. But is Hegel’s logic then the presentation of a non-existent subject? Of an invented, purely fantastic object? In that case, how are we to rethink his constructions critically? With what, with what real object, must we compare and contrast his strings of theoretical determinations in order to distinguish the truth in them from the fallacy? With the real thinking of man? But Hegel would reply that in his _Science of Logic_ it is a matter of quite _**another**_ object, and that if empirically observed human thought is not like it, that is no argument against _**his**_ logic, for criticism of a theory only makes sense when the theory is compared with the same object as it represents, and not with another one; and it is impossible to compare logic with the acts of thinking actually taking place in people’s heads because people think very _**illogically**_ at every step, even elementarily illogically, let alone according to a logic of a much higher order, of the kind that Hegel had in mind.

When you point out to a logician, therefore, that man’s real thinking does not occur as it is depicted in his theory, he could reasonably reply that it was so much the worse _**for this thinking**_ and that the theory did not need to be adapted to the empirical but that real thought must be made logical and brought into harmony with logical principles.

For logic as a science, however, a fundamental difficulty arises here. If it were only permissible to compare logical principles with logical thought, did that then not wipe out any possibility whatsoever of checking whether or not they were _**correct**_? It is quite understandable that these principles would always be in agreement with thoughts that had previously been made to agree with them. After all, it only meant that logical principles agreed with themselves, with their own embodiment in empirical acts of thought. In that case, a very ticklish situation was created for theory. Logic had in mind only logically immaculate thinking, and logically incorrect thinking was not an argument against its schemas. But it consented to consider only such thinking as logically immaculate as exactly confirmed its own ideas about thought, and evaluated any deviation from its rules as a fact falling outside its subject matter and therefore to be considered solely as a ‘mistake’ needing to be ‘corrected’.

In any other science such a claim would evoke consternation. What kind of a theory was it that consented to take into account only such facts as confirmed it, and did not wish to consider contradictory facts, although there must be millions and billions such? But surely that was exactly the traditional position of logic, which was presented by its devotees as standing to reason, and which made logic absolutely unself-critical on the one hand and incapable of development on the other.

That, incidentally, was where Kant’s illusion originated, the illusion that logic as a theory had long ago acquired a fully closed, completed character and not only was not in need of development of its propositions but could not be by its very nature. Schelling also understood Kant’s logic as an absolutely precise presentation of the principles and rules of thinking in concepts.

Hegel had doubts about the proposition that it was the rules of logic that prevented understanding of the process of the passage of the concept into the object and vice versa, of the subjective into the objective (and in general of opposites into one another). He saw in it not evidence of the organic deficiency of thought but only the limitations of Kant’s ideas about it. Kantian logic was only a limitedly true theory of thought. Real thought, the real subject matter of logic as a science, as a matter of fact was something else; therefore it was necessary to bring the theory of thought into agreement with its real subject matter.

Hegel saw the need for a critical reconsideration of traditional logic primarily in the extreme, glaring discrepancy between the principles and rules that Kant considered absolutely universal forms of thought and the real results that had been achieved by human civilisation in the course of its development. ‘ [A comparison of the forms to which Spirit has risen in the worlds of Practice and Religion, and of Science in every department of knowledge Positive and Speculative - a comparison of these with the form which Logic, that is, Spirit’s knowledge of its own pure essence - has attained, shows such a glaring discrepancy that it cannot fail to strike the most superficial observer that the latter is inadequate to the lofty development of the former, and unworthy of it.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlintro.htm#HL1_51a)’

Thus the existing logical theories did not correspond to the real _**practice of thought**_, and _**thinking about thought**_ (i.e. logic) consequently lagged behind _**thinking about everything else**_, behind the thinking that was realised as the science of the external world, as consciousness fixed in the form of knowledge and things created by the power of knowledge, in the form of the whole organism of civilisation. In functioning as _**thinking about the world**_, thought had achieved such success that beside it _**thinking about thought**_ proved to be something quite incommensurable, wretched, deficient, and poor. To take it on faith that human thought had really been and was guided by the rules, laws, and principles that in the aggregate constituted traditional logic was to make all the progress of science and practice simply inexplicable.

Hence there arose the paradox that the human intellect, which had created modern culture, had come to a standstill in amazement before its own creation. Schelling had also expressed this amazement of the ‘spirit’, and it was just at this point that Hegel began to differ with him.

Hegel considered that the rules by which the ‘spirit’ was actually guided, contrary to the illusions that it had created on its own account (in the person of professional logicians) and had set out in the form of textbooks of logic, could and must be brought out and set forth in the _**form of a concept**_, quite rationally, without shifting everything hitherto not comprehended onto ‘intuition’, i.e. onto an ability that was from the very outset something quite different from thought. Hegel’s posing of the matter played a special role because it, for the first time, subjected all the main concepts of logical science, above all the concept of _**thought**_, to careful analysis.

At first glance (and people usually proceed from such a ‘first glance’, adopting it absolutely uncritically from everyday usage), thought represented one of man’s subjective psychic abilities along with others like intuition, sensation, memory, will, and so on and so forth. By thinking was also understood a special kind of _**activity**_ directed, unlike practice, at altering ideas, at reorganising the images that were in the individual’s _**consciousness**_, and directly at the verbal shaping of these ideas in speech; ideas, when expressed in speech (words, terms) were called concepts. When man altered real things outside his head, and not ideas, that was no longer considered thinking, but at best only activities _**in accordance with thought**_, according to the laws and rules dictated by it.

Thought was thus identified with _**reflection**_, i.e. with psychic activity in the course of which a person gave himself an account of what he was doing, and how, and became aware of all the schemas and rules by which he acted. The sole job of logic then proved, quite understandably, to be simply the ordering and classifying of the corresponding schemas and rules. Every individual could discover them for himself in his own _**consciousness**_ because, even without any study of logic, he was guided by them (only not, perhaps, systematically). As Hegel justly put it, ‘[such logic had no other business than could be done through the activity of simple formal thought, and so it certainly produced nothing that one could not otherwise have done just as well](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlintro.htm#HL1_58)’.

Everything we have said also applied fully to Kant, which is why Hegel said that ‘the Kantian philosophy could not have any effect on the treatment of the sciences. _**It left the categories and methods of ordinary knowledge quite undisturbed**_’. It only introduced order into the schemas of existing consciousness, only built them into a system (in so doing, true, it came up against the facts of a mutual contradiction between the various schemas). So the Kantian logic appeared as a kind of honest confession of existing consciousness, of its systematically expounded self-consciousness, and nothing more; or rather, of its _**conceits**_ - an exposition of what existing thought thought of itself. But just as it was a blunder to judge a person according to what and how he thought of himself, so it was impossible to judge thinking by its self-opinion; it was much more useful to examine what it was really doing, and how, possibly even without giving itself a proper evaluation of it.

Having thus posed the problem Hegel proved to be the first professional logician who resolutely and consciously threw aside the old prejudice that thought was presented to the investigator only in the form of speech (external or internal, oral or written). The prejudice was not accidental; thought could only look at itself from the side, as it were, as an object different from itself, only insofar as it had expressed itself, embodied itself in some external form. And the completely conscious thought that all the old logic had in view really assumed language, speech, the word, as its outward form of expression. In other words thought achieved _**awareness**_ of the schemas of its own activity precisely through and in language. (This circumstance had in fact been recorded in the very name of logic, which is derived from the Greek _logos_, word.) Not only Hegel and the Hegelians, incidentally, spoke of this, but also some of their opponents in principle, like Trendelenburg, who noted that traditional (formal) ‘logic becomes conscious of itself in speech and so in many respects is a grammar absorbed with itself’.

Let us note in passing that all schools of logic, without exception, having ignored Hegel’s criticism of the old logic have shared this old prejudice to this day as though nothing had happened. It is most outspokenly professed by Neopositivists, who directly identify thought with linguistic activity and logic with the analysis of language. The most striking thing about this is the self-conceit with which they project this archaic prejudice as the latest discovery of twentieth century logical thinking, as the manifestation to the world at long last of the principle of the scientific development of logic, as an axiom of the ‘logic of science’.

Language (speech) is, nevertheless, not the sole empirically observed form in which human thought manifests itself. Does man really not discover himself as a _**thinking**_ being in his actions, in the course of actually shaping the world around him, in the making of things? Does he really only function as a thinking being when talking? The question is surely purely rhetorical. The thought of which Hegel spoke discloses itself in human _**affairs**_ every bit as obviously as in words, in chains of terms, in the lacework of word combinations. Furthermore, in real affairs man demonstrates the real modes of his thinking more adequately than in his narrations of them.

But, that being so, man’s _**actions**_, and so too the results of his actions, the things created by them, not only could, but must, be considered _**manifestations of his thought**_, as acts of the objectifying of his ideas, thoughts, plans, and conscious intentions. Hegel demanded from the very start that thought should be investigated _**in all the forms**_ in which it was realised, and above all in human affairs, in the creation of things and events. Thought revealed its force and real power not solely in talking but also in the whole grandiose process of creating culture and the whole objective body of civilisation, the whole ‘inorganic body of man’ (Marx), including in that tools and statues, workshops and temples, factories and chancelleries, political organisations and systems of legislation.

It was on that basis that Hegel also acquired the right to consider in logic the objective determinations of things outside consciousness, _**outside the psyche of the human individual**_, in all their independence, moreover, from that psyche. There was nothing mystical nor idealist in that; it meant the forms (‘determinations’) of things created by the activity of the thinking individual. In other words, the forms of his thought embodied in natural materials, ‘invested’ in it by human activity. Thus a house appeared as the architect’s conception embodied in stone, a machine as the embodiment of the engineer’s ideas in metal, and so on; and the whole immense objective body of civilisation as thought in its ‘otherness’ (_das Idee in der Form des Anderssein_), in its sensual objective embodiment. The whole history of humanity was correspondingly also to be considered a process of the ‘outward revelation’ of the power of thought, as a process of the realisation of man’s ideas, concepts, notions, plans, intentions, and purposes, _**as a process of the embodying of logic**_, i.e. of the schemas to which men’s purposive activity was subordinated.

The understanding and careful analysis of thought in this aspect (investigation of the ‘active side’ as Marx called it in his first thesis on Feuerbach) was still not idealism. Logic, furthermore, by following such a path, thus took the decisive step toward genuine (‘intelligent’) materialism, toward understanding of the fact that all logical forms without exception were universal forms of the development of reality outside thought, reflected in human consciousness and tested in the course of millennia of practice. In considering thought in the course of its materialisation as well as in its verbal revelation Hegel did not go beyond the bounds of the analysis of _**thought**_ at all, beyond the limits of the subject matter of logic as a special science. He simply brought into the field of view of logic that real phase of the process of development of thought without understanding which logic could not and never would be able to become a real science.

From Hegel’s standpoint the real basis for the forms and laws of thought proved to be only the aggregate historical process of the _**intellectual development of humanity**_ understood in its universal and necessary aspects. The subject matter of logic was no longer the abstract identical schemas that could be found in each individual consciousness, and common to each of them, but the _**history of science and technique**_ collectively created by people, a process quite independent of the will and consciousness of the separate individuals although realised at each of its stages precisely in the conscious activity of individuals. This process, according to Hegel, also included, as a phase, the act of realising thought in object activity, and through activity in the forms of things and events outside consciousness. In that, in Lenin’s words, he ‘came very close to materialism’.

In considering thought as a real productive process expressing itself not only in the movement of words but also in the changing of things, Hegel was able, for the first time in the history of logic, to pose the problem of a special analysis of thought-forms, or the analysis of thought from the aspect of form. Before him such an aim had not arisen in logic, and even could not have. ‘It is hardly surprising that economists, wholly under the influence of material interests, have overlooked the formal side of the relative expression of value, when professional logicians, before Hegel, even overlooked the formal aspect of the propositions and conclusions they used as examples.’

Logicians before Hegel had recorded only the external schemas in which logical actions, judgments and inferences functioned _**in speech**_, i.e. as schemas of the joining together of terms signifying general ideas, but the logical form expressed in these figures, i.e. the category, remained outside their sphere of investigation, and the conception of it was simply borrowed from metaphysics and ontology. So it had been even with Kant, despite the fact that he had nevertheless seen categories precisely as the _**principles of judgments**_ (with objective significance, in his sense).

And since logical form, about which Marx spoke in the first edition of _Das Kapital_, was understood as a form of activity realised equally well in the movement of verbal terms and in the movement of the things involved in the work of the thinking being, there then for the first time only, arose the possibility of analysing it specially as such, of abstracting it from the special features of its expression in some partial material or other (including those which were linked with the specific features of its realisation in the fabric of language).

In _logos_, in reason, _Sage und Sache_, i.e. myth and fact, or rather legend and true story, were equally expressed in the logical aspect (in contrast to the psychological-phenomenological). (Incidentally, play on words, for example, was very characteristic of Hegel, puns however that threw light on the genetic relationship of the ideas expressed by the words. _Sage_ is legend, myth, hence ‘saga’, a legend of high deeds (cf. _bylina_, the form of Russian epic); _Sache_ is a broad capacious word signifying not so much a single, sensuously perceived thing, as the essence of the matter, situation, the point, the actual state of affairs (or things), i.e. everything that is or was in the matter itself (cf. Russian _byl’_, meaning a true story, fact, what really happened). This etymology is used in the _Science of Logic_ to express very important shades of meaning, which sound as follows in [Lenin’s translation and materialist interpretation](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/preface.htm#LCW38_92d1): ‘"With this introduction of Content into logical consideration", the subject becomes not _Dinge_ but _die Sache_, _der Begriff der Dinge_ [i.e. not things, but the essence, the concept of things], not things but the laws of their movement, materialistically."

Considered as the activity of the thinking being in its universal form, thought was also fixed in those of its schemas and moments as remained _**invariant**_ in whatever special material the relevant activity was performed and whatever product it put out at any one instant. In the Hegelian view it was quite irrelevant how, precisely, the action of thinking took place or takes place, whether in articulated vibrations of the ambient air and their identifying signs or in some other natural, physical substance. ‘[In all human contemplation there is thought, just as thought is the general in all conceptions, recollections, and on the whole any mental activity, in all wishes, desires, etc. All these are only further specifications of thought. While we so conceive thought, it itself appears in another aspect than when we only speak; we have intellectual power over and above any other abilities, like contemplation, imagination, will and the like.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL21)’

All the universal schemas being depicted in the activity of the thinking being, including that directed toward immediately intuited or represented material, must therefore be considered not less as _**logical**_ parameters of thought than the schemas of its expression in language, or in the form of the figures known in the old logic. Thought in the broadest sense of the word, as activity altering images of the external world in general expressed in words (and not the words in themselves), the thought that really ‘[effects everything human and makes humanity human](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL2_2)’, as a capacity that creates knowledge in any forms, including that of the contemplated images, and ‘penetrates’ into them, and hence not simply the subjective, psychic act of using or treating words, was the subject matter of logic, the science of thought.

Thought, in fact, included the human ‘[_**determination**_ of sensation, intuition, images, ideas, aims, obligations, etc., and also thoughts and concepts](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL3)’ (‘thoughts and concepts’ here have the meaning of the old, purely formal logic). Thought in general thus ‘[_**appears**_ at first not in the form of thought but as feeling, intuition, imagination - _**forms**_ that are to be distinguished from thought as form](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL2_3)’. The thought-form as such appears to us only in the _**course of thinking about thought itself**_, i.e. only in logic.

But before man began to think about _**thought**_, he had already _**to think**_, though still not realising the logical schemas and categories within which this thinking took place, but already embodying them in the form of the concrete statements and concepts of science, engineering, morals, and so on. Thought was thus realised at first as activity in all the diversity of its outward manifestations. The thought-form here was ‘sunk’ into the material of concrete thoughts, sense images, and ideas, was ‘sublated’ in them, and was therefore counterposed to conscious thinking as the form of external reality. In other words, thought and the thought-form did not appear at first to the thinking being as forms of his own activity at all (of his ‘self’ - _das Selbst_), creating a certain product, but as forms of the _**product itself**_, i.e. of concrete knowledge, images and concepts, intuition and representation, as the forms of tools, machines, states, etc., etc., and as the forms of realised aims, wishes, desires, and so on.

Thought could not ‘see’ itself otherwise than in the mirror of its own creations, in the mirror of the external world, _**which we knew through thought-activity**_. Thought, as it appeared in logic, was thus the same thought as had been realised in the form of knowledge of the world, in the form of science, engineering, art, and morality. But it was far from the same thing _**in form**_, because ‘there is a difference between having sensations and ideas, determined and _**penetrated by thought**_, and having _**thoughts about them**_’.

Neglect of this very important distinction led the old logic into a dual error. On the one hand it only defined thought as ‘a subjective, psychic capability of the individual’ and therefore counterposed to thought so understood the whole sphere of ‘intuition, ideas, and will’ as something existing outside thought and having nothing in common with it, as the object of reflection existing outside thought. On the other hand, in not distinguishing _**in form**_ between the relative strength of the two revelations of thought mentioned above, it could also not say how the _**thought-form**_ as such (‘in and for itself’) was differentiated from the form of intuition and representation, in the shape of which it had originally appeared and was hidden, and consequently confused the one with the other, taking the form of the concept for the form of intuition, and vice versa.

Hence, too, it came about that, under the form of _**concept**_, the old logic considered every kind of _**idea**_ or _**notion**_ whatsoever, insofar as it was expressed in speech or in a term, that is to say, the image of intuition or contemplation held in consciousness by means of speech, which recorded it. As a result, too, the old logic embraced the concept itself only from the aspect from which it was really not distinguished in any way from any notion or intuitive image expressed in speech, from the aspect of the abstract and general, which was really just as common to the concept as to the notion. Thus it came about that it took the form of _**abstract identity**_ or _**abstract universality**_ for the specific form of the concept, and could therefore only raise the law of identity and the principle of contradiction in determinations to the rank of absolute, fundamental criteria of the thought-form in general.

Kant also took that stand, understanding by concept _**any general notion**_ insofar as it was fixed by a term. Hence his definition: ‘The concept is... a general image or representation of that which is common to many objects, consequently a general idea, _**provided that it can be included in several objects**_.’

Hegel himself required a more profound solution of the _**problem of the concept and of thinking in concepts**_ from logic. For him a concept was primarily a synonym for real _**understanding**_ of the essence of the matter and not simply an expression of something general, of some identity of the objects of intuition. A concept disclosed the real nature of a thing and not its similarity with other things; and not only should it express the abstract generality of its object (that was only one of the moments of a concept, relating it to notion), but also the _**special nature**_ or peculiarity of the object. That was why the form of the concept proved to be a dialectical unity of universality and particularity, a unity that was also _**revealed**_ through manifold forms of judgment and inference, and came out into the open in judgments. It was not surprising that any judgment destroyed the form of abstract identity and represented its self-evident _**negation**_. Its form was: A is B (i.e. not-A).

Hegel distinguished clearly between universality, which dialectically contained the whole richness of the particular and the singular within itself and in its determinations, and the simple abstract generality, identicalness, of all the single objects of a given kind. The universal _**concept**_ expressed itself the _**actual law**_ of the origin, development, and fading or disappearance of single things. And that was already quite another angle on the concept, much truer and deeper, because, as Hegel demonstrated with a mass of examples, the real law (the immanent nature of the single thing) did not always appear on the surface of phenomena in the form of a simple identicalness, of a common sign or attribute, or in the form of identity. If that were so there would be no need for any theoretical science. The job of thought was not limited to empirically registering common attributes. The central concept of Hegel’s logic was therefore the _**concrete-universal**_: he brilliantly illustrated its distinction from the simple, abstract universality of the sphere of notions in his famous pamphlet _Wer denkt abstrakt?_ (_Who thinks abstractly?_). To think abstractly meant to be enslaved by the force of current catchphrases and clichés, of one-sided, empty definitions; meant to see in real, sensuously intuited things only an insignificant part of their real content, only such determinations of them as were already ‘jelled’ in consciousness and functioned there as ready-made stereotypes. Hence the ‘magic force’ of current catchphrases and expressions, which fence reality off from the thinking person instead of serving as the form of its expression.

In this last interpretation logic finally became a real logic of understanding of _**unity in variety**_, and not a scheme for manipulating readymade ideas and notions; a logic of critical and self-critical thought and not a means of the uncritical classification and pedantic, schematic presentation of existing ideas.

From premises of that kind Hegel concluded that real thought in fact took other forms and was governed by other laws than those that current logic considered the sole determinations of thinking. Thought had obviously to be investigated as collective, co-operative activity in the course of which the individual, with his schemas of conscious thinking, performed only partial functions. In fulfilling them, however, he was constantly forced at the same time to perform actions that would not fit in, in any way, with the schemas of ordinary logic. In really taking part in common work he was all the time subordinating himself to the laws and forms of _**universal thought**_, though not conscious of them as such. Hence the ‘topsy-turvy’ situation arose in which the real forms and laws of thought were expressed and understood as some kind of _**external necessity**_, as an _**extra-logical**_ determination of the action; and on the sole ground that they were still not revealed and realised by logic, not acknowledged as logical interpretations.

As can easily be seen, Hegel criticised traditional logic, and the thinking appropriate to it, by the same ‘immanent procedure’ that was one of his main conquests, namely, he counterposed to the assertions, rules, and basic propositions of logic not some kind of opposing assertions, rules and basic propositions but the process of the practical realisation of its own principles in real thought. He showed it its own image, pointing out those of its features that it preferred not to notice and not to recognise. Hegel required only one thing of thinking in accordance with logic, namely uncompromising consistency in applying the principles adduced. And he showed that it was the consistent application of these principles (and not departure from them) that in fact led inevitably, with inexorable force, to _**negation**_ of the principles themselves as one-sided, incomplete, and abstract.

That was the very critique of reason, from the standpoint of reason itself, that Kant had begun; and this critique (self-criticism) of reason and its circumscribing logic led to the conclusion that ‘[the nature of thought is itself dialectics, that as understanding it must fall into the negative of itself, into contradiction. . .](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL11_1)’. Kant had actually reached a similar conclusion; and whereas before him logic could be unself-critical _**out of ignorance**_, now it could maintain its precarious position only if it quite consciously rejected facts unacceptable to it, only by becoming _**consciously unself-critical**_.

The historically unavoidable defect of Kantian logic was that it pedantically schematised and described a mode of thought that led to a bringing out and sharp formulation of the contradictions contained in any concept but did not show how they could and should be resolved _**logically**_ without shifting this difficult task onto ‘practical reason’, onto ‘moral postulates’, and other factors and abilities lying outside logic. Hegel, however, saw the main job facing logic after the work of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, as precisely in finding, bringing out, and indicating to thought, the means of intelligently and concretely resolving the contradictions into which it inevitably fell when consciously guided by the traditional, purely formal logic. That, too, was the real distinction between Hegel’s conception of thought and logic and all preceding ones.

The old logic, coming up against the logical contradiction that it itself brought to light just because it rigorously followed its own principles, always baulked at it, retreated to analysis of the preceding movement of thought, and always strove to find an error or mistake in it leading to the contradiction. For formal logical thinking contradictions thus became an insurmountable barrier to the forward movement of thought, an obstacle in the way of concrete analysis of the essence of the matter. It therefore also came about that ‘[thought, despairing of managing _**by itself**_ to resolve the contradiction into which it had got itself, turns back to the solutions and reliefs that were the spirit’s lot in its other modes and forms](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm#SL11_1)’. It could not be otherwise, since the contradiction did not develop through a mistake. No mistake, it ultimately proved, had been made in the preceding thinking. It was necessary to go even further back, to uncomprehended contemplation, sense perception, aesthetic intuition, i.e. to the realm of lower forms of consciousness (lower, that is, in relation to conceptual thinking), where there was really no contradiction for the simple reason that it had still not been disclosed and clearly expressed. (It never hurts, of course, to go back and analyse the preceding course of argument and check whether there has not been a formal mistake, for that also happens not infrequently; and here the recommendations of formal logic have a quite rational sense and value. It may turn out, as a result of checking, that a given logical contradiction is really nothing but the result of committing an error or mistake somewhere. Hegel, of course, never dreamed of denying such a case. He, like Kant, had in mind only those antinomies that developed in thought as a result of the most formally ‘correct’ and faultless argumentation.)

Hegel also suggested that a contradiction should be resolved as well as disclosed, and resolved by the same logical thinking as had brought it out when a definite concept was being developed.

He treated both the origin and the mode of resolution of logical contradictions differently. Like Kant he understood that they did not arise at all through the negligence or carelessness of individual thinking persons but unlike Kant he understood that they could and must be resolved and must not always be preserved as antinomies. But so that it could resolve them thought must fix them sharply and clearly in advance, precisely as antinomies, as _**logical**_ contradictions, as real, and not imaginary, contradictions in determinations.

Dialectics, according to Hegel, was the form (or method or schema) of thought that included the process both of elucidating contradictions and of concretely resolving them in the corpus of a higher and more profound stage of rational understanding of the same object, on the way toward further investigation of the essence of the matter, i.e. in the course of developing science, engineering, and ‘morality’, and all the spheres he called the ‘objective spirit’.

This conception immediately brought about constructive shifts in the whole system of logic. Whereas Kant’s ‘dialectic’ was only the final, third part of logic (the doctrine on the forms of understanding and reason), where it was a matter actually of the statement of the logically unresolvable antinomies of theoretical cognition, with Hegel it appeared quite another matter. With him the sphere of the logical was divided into three main sections or aspects, i.e. three main directions were distinguished in it, as follows:

1. the abstract or rational;

2. the dialectical or negatively reasonable;

3. the speculative or positively reasonable.

Hegel specially stressed that ‘[these three aspects in no case constitute three _**parts**_ of logic, but are only _**moments of any logically real nature**_, that is of any concept or of any truth in general](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL79)’.

In the empirical history of thought (as in any given, historically achieved state of it) these three aspects appeared either as three consecutive ‘formations’ or as three different but closely related systems of logic. Hence we got the illusion that they could be depicted as three different sections (or ‘parts’) of logic, following one after the other.

Logic as a whole, however, could not be obtained by a simple uniting of these three aspects, each of which was taken in the form in which it had been developed in the history of thought. That called for critical treatment of all three aspects from the standpoint of higher principles, those historically last achieved. Hegel characterised the three ‘moments’ of logical thought that should constitute Logic as follows.

1. ‘[Thought as _**understanding**_ remains stuck in firm determination and does not get beyond differentiation of the latter; such a limited abstraction applies to it as existing and being for itself.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL80)’ The separate (isolated) historical embodiment of this ‘moment’ in thought appeared as _**dogmatism**_, and its logical, theoretical self-awareness as ‘general‘, i.e. purely formal logic.

2. ‘[The _**dialectical**_ moment is the own self-abolition of such ultimate determinations and their transition into their opposites.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_vi.htm#SL80)’ Historically this moment appears as _**scepticism**_, i.e. as the state in which thought, feeling bewildered among opposing, equally ‘logical’ and mutually provoking dogmatic systems, is powerless to choose and prefer one of them. Logical self-awareness, corresponding to the stage of scepticism, was distinguished in the Kantian conception of dialectics as a state of the insolubility of the antinomies between dogmatic systems. Scepticism (Kant’s type of ‘negative dialectic’) was higher than dogmatism both historically and in content because the dialectic included in reason or understanding was already _**realised**_, and existed not only ‘in itself’ but ‘for itself’.

3. ‘[The _**speculative or positively reasonable**_ conceives the unity of determinations in their opposition, the _**affirmation**_ that is contained in their resolution and their transition](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_divis.htm#SL82).’ Hegel also saw systematic treatment of this last ‘moment’ (and correspondingly critical rethinking of the first two from the angle of the third) as the historically pressing task in logic, and therefore his own mission and the aim of his work.

When critically rethought in the light of the principles only now elicited, the ‘moments’ considered ceased to be independent parts of logic and were transformed into three abstract aspects of one and the same logical system. Then a logic was created such that, when thinking was guided by it, thought became fully self-critical and was in no danger of falling into either the dullness of dogmatism or into the sterility of sceptical neutrality.

Hence, too, there followed the external, formal division of logic into (1) the doctrine of being,(2) the doctrine of essence, and (3) the doctrine of the notion (concept, idea).

The division of logic into the objective (the first two sections) and the subjective coincided at first glance with the old division of philosophy into ontology and logic proper; but Hegel stressed that such a division would be very inexact and arbitrary because, in logic, the opposition between the subjective and the objective (in their ordinary meaning) disappeared.

His position on this question calls besides for a thorough commentary since superficial criticism of his conception of logic and its subject matter has so far been primarily that his position _**ignored**_ the opposition (contrast) between the subjective and the objective (between thinking and being) and therefore casuistically produced specifically logical schemas of thought for the ontological determination of things outside thought and, on the contrary, universal definitions of the reality outside thought for schemas of the logical process, thus committing two sins: (a) hypostatising logical forms, and (b) logicalising reality.

If the original sin of Hegelianism had really been a simple, naive blindness in relation to the contrast between thought and reality, between the concept and its object, then Kant’s dualism would have been the apex of philosophical wisdom. In fact, however, Hegel’s ‘error’ was not so simple, and was not in the least characterised by the evaluation cited above. Hegel saw the difference and, what is more important, the contradiction (opposition) between the world of things outside consciousness and the world of thought (the world in thought, in science, in _**concepts**_), and was much more acutely aware of it than his naive critics among the Kantians; and in any case he ascribed much greater significance for logic to this opposition than, say, positivists do (who, especially in a logic, directly identify the concept and the object of the concept).

The point is quite another one; and another understanding of it follows from the specifically Hegelian conception of _**thought**_, and thus also from Hegel’s solution of the problem of the relation of thought and the world of things.

That is why, when Hegel formulated a programme for the critical transformation of logic as a science, he posed the task of bringing it (i.e. thought’s awareness of the universal schemas of its own work) into correspondence with its real object, i.e. with real thought, with its real universal forms and laws.

The last-named do not exist in thought simply or even so much as schemas and rules of _**conscious**_ thinking, but rather as universal schemas of _**objective**_ thinking that are realised not so much as a subjective psychic act as the productive process that created science, technique and morality.

In defending the objectivity of logical forms so understood, Hegel of course was right in many respects; and his critique of the subjective idealist interpretation of the logical (Hume, Kant, Fichte) is topical in the struggle against many of their present-day successors, in particular Neopositivists. As social formations science and technique (‘the materialised power of knowledge’ as Marx defined it) exist and develop of course outside the individual’s consciousness. But, according to Hegel, there was no other consciousness than that of the individual, never had been, and never would be; and the logical forms of development of science and technique really stood in opposition to the consciousness and will of the individual as quite objective limits to his individually performed actions, even as limits dictated to him _**from outside**_.

‘According to these determinations, thoughts can be called objective, and they can also be taken to include the forms that are considered for the present in ordinary logic and are looked upon only as forms of _**conscious**_ thought. Logic here coincides with _Metaphysics_, with the science of _**things**_ conceived in thought...’

In this conception of the objectivity of thought-forms there was as yet, of course, no facet of the specifically Hegelian, i.e. _**objective**_, idealism. One cannot reproach Hegel with having allegedly extended the boundaries of the subject matter of logic impermissibly so that it began to embrace not only thought but things. Hegel (and Kant, too) did not in general speak just about _**things as such**_; he had in mind exclusively things _**comprehended in thoughts**_. It was in that sense that he asserted that ‘in logic thoughts are so conceived that they have no other content than that belonging to the thought itself and produced through it’. In other words logic had in mind not things but those of _**their determinations**_ as were posited by the action of thought, i.e. _**scientific**_ determinations.

Thus, what Hegel affirmed within the limits of consideration of pure thought was much more rigorous and consistent than the logic before him; and he justly reproached it precisely for not having been able to confine itself rigorously within the bounds of its own subject matter, and for having imported into it material not assimilated by thought and not reproduced by thought-activity.

His requirement of including all the categories (the subject matter of the old metaphysics and ontology) in logic in no way meant going beyond the limits of thought. It was equivalent to a demand for a critical analysis to be made of the _**thought-activity**_ that had engendered the determinations of the old metaphysics, and for those thought-forms to be brought out that both logic and metaphysics had applied quite uncritically and unconsciously, without clearly realising what they consisted of. Hegel had no doubt that ‘thought-forms must not be used without having been subjected to investigation’ and that ‘we must make the thought-forms themselves the object of cognition’. But such an investigation was already thought, and the activity taking place in those very forms was the act of applying them. If we looked on logic as investigation (cognition) of thought-forms, he wrote, this investigation ‘must also unite the activity of thought-forms and their critique in cognition. The thought-forms must be taken in and for themselves; they are the object and the activity of the object itself; they themselves inquire into themselves, must determine their limits and demonstrate their defects themselves. That will then be that activity of thought that will soon be given separate consideration as _**dialectics**_. . .

The subject matter of logic then proved to be those really _**universal**_ forms and patterns within which the collective consciousness of humanity was realised. The course of its development, empirically realised as the history of science and technique, was also seen as that ‘whole’ to the interests of which all the individual’s separate logical acts were subordinated.

And inasmuch as the individual was involved in the common cause, in the work of _**universal**_ thought, he was continually forced to perform actions dictated ‘by the interests of the whole’ and not confined to the schemas of ‘general’ logic. He would naturally not realise his actions in logical concepts, although these acts were performed by _**his own thinking**_. The schemas (forms and laws) of universal thought would be realised unconsciously through his psyche. (Not ‘unconsciously’ in general, but without _**logical**_ consciousness of them, without their expression in logical concepts and categories.)

In this connection Hegel introduced one of his most important distinctions between thought ‘in itself’ (_an sich_), which also constituted the subject matter, the object of investigation, in logic, and thought ‘for itself’ (_für sich selbst_), i.e. thought that had already become aware of the schemas, principles, forms, and laws of its own work and had already worked quite consciously in accordance with them, fully and clearly realising what it was doing, and how it was doing it. Logic was also consciousness, the expression through concepts and categories of those laws and forms in accordance with which the process of thinking ‘in itself’ (_an sich_) took place. In logic it also became the _**object for itself**_ .

In logic thought had consequently to become the same ‘for itself’ as it had earlier been only ‘in itself’.

Hegel therefore also formulated the task of bringing logic into line with its _**real subject matter**_, with _**real thought**_, with the really universal forms and laws of development of science, technique, and morality.

In other words he wanted to make the subjective consciousness of thought about itself _**identical**_ with its object, with the real universal and necessary (objective) forms and laws of universal (and not individual) thought. That also meant that the principle of the _**identity of the subjective and the objective**_ must be introduced into logic as the highest principle, i.e. the principle that the real forms and laws of thought must be delineated in logic exactly, adequately, and correctly. The principle of the identity of subject and object signified nothing more, and did not signify any ‘hypostatisation’ of the forms of subjective thought, because one and the same thought was both object and subject in logic, and it was a matter of the agreement, coincidence, and identity of this thought (as consciously performed activity) with itself as unconsciously performed productive activity, or as activity hitherto taking place with a false consciousness of its own actions.

In defending the _**objectivity**_ of logical forms Hegel of course stood head and shoulders above (and closer to materialism) than all those who up to the present have reproached him with having ‘hypostatised’ logical forms in order to defend their version of the identity of thought and object as a purely conventional principle, as the principle of the identity of sign and thing designated, of the concept and that which is thought in it. Hegel was 100 per cent right in his critique of the subjective idealist version of the logical and of its objectivity (as merely the agreement of all thinking individuals, as merely the identity - read _**equality**_ of all the schemas by which each Ego taken separately operated). His critique not only hit at Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, but also strikes all today’s Neopositivists.

(Marx, incidentally, also defined the categories of political economy as ‘objective thought-forms’: ‘They are the socially valid, and therefore objective thought-forms....’)

Thus the statement that there was no difference for logic between the subjective and the objective did not mean anything else on Hegel’s lips than an affirmation that logic must consider, within itself, within its own theory, and link together in one system, literally _**all**_ the logical schemas of thought activity, beginning with the categories and finishing up with the figures of judgments and conclusions. And within it there must be room both for those schemas that prior to Kant were considered simply determinations of things outside consciousness and for those that were usually considered to be ‘specific’ to consciousness and had allegedly _**no**_ relation to things outside the mind.

Hegel did not dream of repudiating the differences between the categorial schemas given in the determinations of categories and the figures of formal logic, of course; but he did require them to be explained and disclosed within logic itself and not to be presumed in advance, uncritically borrowed from the old metaphysic and its corresponding logic. He required the one and the other to be included in logic in critically rethought form.

‘The relation of such forms as concept, judgment, and conclusion to other forms like causality, etc., can only be discovered within logic itself.’

Hegel thus did not include the determinations of things as they existed outside the mind or in everyday consciousness in logic at all, but solely those determinations that appeared to the mind in _**science**_, and in theoretical consciousness, that were ‘posited’ or formulated by _**thought itself**_. And since science was the realised force (faculty) of thought, materialised mental, theoretical labour, he also saw primarily ‘objectified’ _**determinations of thought**_ in the determinations of things.

The requirement of including all _**categories**_ in logic was therefore equivalent to requiring a critical analysis to be made of those _**activities**_ of thought that were materialised or objectified in the concepts of the old metaphysic, and to requiring disclosure of the _**logic of thought**_ that was earlier realised in the form of various schemas of the universe, and so to requiring a critical understanding of all the categories that the old logic had taken over quite uncritically from ontological systems.

Hegel thus did not go outside the framework of the subject matter of logic at all but only beyond the limits of the notions of earlier logicians about these limits. While remaining within the boundaries of the investigation of thought, and only of thought, he nevertheless saw more within those boundaries than previous logicians, and saw those logical (universal) schemas of developing thought that the old logic had not considered universal at all and had therefore not included in the theory. Logic thus proved to be pinned to discovery and investigation of the _**objective**_ laws governing the subjective activity of individuals, and those forms in which, whether or not the individuals so wished it, or whether or not they realised it, they were forced, insofar in general as they thought, to express the results of their subjective efforts.

That is in what Hegel saw the true difference between the real _**laws**_ of thought and the rules that the old logic had promoted to the rank of laws. Man can break rules, unlike laws, and does so at every step, thus demonstrating that they are not laws. Because laws cannot be broken, they constitute the determinateness of the object, which cannot be omitted without the object itself, in this case _**thought**_, ceasing to exist.

And if man thinks, then his activities are subordinated to law and cannot overstep its bounds, although he may at the same time break the rules in the most flagrant way. A law can be ‘broken’ in one way only, by ceasing to think, i.e. by escaping from the realm that is governed by the laws of thought and where they operate as inexorably as the law of gravitation in the world of spatially determined bodies. But for man such a ‘way out’ is equivalent to overstepping the bounds of human existence in general.

Hegel also showed that the real development of determinations, i.e. the real forward movement of thought, even in the simplest cases, not to mention the process of development of science, technique, and morality, took place precisely through breach (or removal) of all the rules that had been established for thought by the old logic, through their dialectical negation. But the constant _**negation**_ of the rules established by conscious thought for itself got out of control, was not aware of itself, and proved to be a fact _**outside thought**_, although it took place within the latter. Thought had this fact ‘in itself’ but not ‘_**for itself**_’.

But as soon as this fact was recognised as a universal and necessary logical thought-form, it was also transformed into a _**fact of consciousness**_, a fact of conscious thought, and the latter became _**consciously**_ dialectical. Previously it had only been so ‘in itself’, i.e. despite its own consciousness of itself. But now it became ‘for itself’ precisely what it had previously been only ‘in itself’.

The subject matter of logic consequently could not merely be the forms that had already been realised or apprehended, and had already been included in existing consciousness (in textbooks of logic and metaphysics). It was impossible to grasp them _**ready-made**_, or to classify them. They had to be brought out in the very course of reasoning about them, in the course of actual thinking about thought.

And when Kant considered the forms of thought as some ready-made object, already depicted (realised, comprehended), his logic represented only an uncritical classification of existing notions about thought.

But if logic was to be a science, it must be a critical, systematic investigation that did not accept a single determination on faith, and unproved by thought, i.e. without being reproduced by it quite consciously. In this investigation _**criticism**_ of the thought-forms known to cultivated thinking was only possible and thinkable as _**self-criticism**_. The schemas, rules, forms, principles, and laws of this thought were here subjected to criticism not by comparing them with some object lying outside them, but solely by bringing out the dialectic they included in themselves and which was discovered immediately as soon as we began in general to think, rigorously and fully realising what we were doing and how we were doing it.

In that way, too, the very identity of the forms of cultivated thought with the forms of the unconsciously performed actions of the intellect must be carried out, actions to which thought had had to submit during the historical process of its realisation in the form of science, technique, art and morality. Logic was nothing else (or rather should be nothing else) than the proper apprehension of those forms and laws within which the real thinking of people took place. The identity of thought and the conceivable, as the principle of the logical development and construction of logic, signified nothing more.

It was merely a matter of this, that the schemas of _**cultivated thought**_ (i.e. of the processes taking place in the consciousness of the individual) should coincide with those of the structure of the science in the movement of which the individual was involved, i.e. with the ‘logic’ dictated by its content. If the schema of the activity of a theoretician coincided with that of the development of his science, and the science was thus developed through his activity, Hegel would attest the _**logicality**_ of his activity, i.e. the _**identity**_ of his thinking with that impersonal, universal process which we also call the development of science. Logic recognised the activities of such a theoretician as logical also when they were even formally not quite irreproachable from the standpoint of the canons of the old logic.

Hegel therefore began to consider all the categories (of quality, quantity, measure, causality, probability, necessity, the general and the particular, and so on and so forth) in quite a new way. For him they were not at all the most general determinations of the things given in intuition or contemplation or in direct experience to each individual, not transcendental schemas of synthesis directly inherent (i.e. inborn) in each individual consciousness (as Kant, Fichte, and Schelling had in fact treated them). It was impossible to discover these thought-forms in the separate consciousness taken in isolation, within the individual Ego. They were there at best only ‘in themselves’, only in the form of unrealised tendencies and so not brought to awareness. Categories were only discovered and demonstrated their determinations through the historically developing scientific, technical, and moral ‘perfecting’ of the human race, because only in it, and not in the experience of the isolated individual, did thought become ‘for itself’ what it had been ‘in itself’.

Categories themselves, in the individual’s own experience (were revealed in action, in processing of the data of perception) not in the whole fullness and dialectical complexity of their composition and connections but only in abstract, one-sided aspects. It was therefore impossible to derive them from analysis of the experience of the isolated individual. They were only discovered through the very complex process of the interaction of a mass of single minds mutually correcting each other in discussion, debate, and confrontations, i.e. through a frankly dialectical process that, like a huge centrifuge, ultimately separated the purely objective schemas of thought from the purely subjective (in the sense of individual, arbitrary) schemas of activity, and as a result crystallised out logic, a system of determinations of purely universal, impersonal, and featureless thought in general.

Categories were therefore also universal forms of the origin of any object in _**thought**_, gradually depicted in the aggregate scientific consciousness of humanity. They were universal determinations of the object _**as and how**_ it appeared in the eyes of science, in the ether of ‘universal thought’. Hegel consented to call determinations of things only those determinations that had been developed by science, by active thought. They were, therefore, none other than thought-forms realised in concrete material, determinations of thought embodied in the object, i e. in the scientific concept of the external thing. Hegel, therefore, and only therefore, also spoke of the identity of thought and object and defined the object as a concept realised in sensuous, physical material.

The determinations of categories, naturally, could also function as determinations of things in the contemplation (experience) of the individual; not of every individual, however, but only of those who in the course of their education had mastered the historical experience of humanity, and ‘reproduced’ in their individual consciousness the path taken by human thought (of course, only in its main, decisive features and schemas). Categories were the forms of organisation of this experience (described by Hegel in his _Phenomenology of Mind_ ).

Categories were thus universal forms of the reconstruction, reproduction, in the _**consciousness of the individual**_ of those objects that had been created before him by the collective efforts of past generations of thinking beings, by the power of their collective, impersonal thought. In individually repeating the experience of humanity, which had created the world of spiritual and material culture surrounding him from the cradle, this individual also repeated that which had been done before him and for him by the ‘universal spirit’, and so acted according to the same laws and in the same forms as the impersonal ‘universal spirit’ of humanity. That means that categories appeared at once as universal schemas of the scientific formation of the individual consciousness, rising gradually from the zero level of its erudition to the highest stages of spiritual culture at the given moment, and as schemas of the individual mastery (reproduction) of the whole world of images created by the thought of preceding generations and standing opposed to the individual as a quite objective world of spiritual and material culture, the world of the concepts of science, technique and morality.

This world was the materialised thought of humanity, realised in the product, was alienated thought in general; and the individual had to de-objectify, and arrogate to himself, the modes of activity that were realised in it, and it was in that the process if his/her education properly consisted. In the trained mind categories actually functioned as active forms of a concept. When the individual had them in his/her experience, and made them forms of his/her own activity, he/she also possessed them, and knew and realised them, _**as thought-forms**_. Otherwise they remained only _**general forms of the things**_ given in contemplation and representation, and counterposed to thought as a reality existing outside it and independently of it.

With this was linked the naive fetishism that directly accepted the _**available**_ concepts and notions of science about things, the norms of morals and justice, the forms of the state and political system and the similar products of the thinking of people who had objectified their own conscious activity in them, for purely objective determinations of things in themselves. It accepted them as such only because it _**did not know**_ that they had not been created without the involvement of thought, and did not know _**how**_, moreover, they were produced by thought. It could not reproduce or repeat the process of thought that had brought them into being and therefore, naturally, considered them eternal and unalterable determinations of things in themselves, and the expression of their essence. It believed quite uncritically, on trust, everything that it was told about these things in the name of science, the state and God. It believed not only that these things _**appeared**_ so today in the eyes of the thinking person but also that they were really so.

Hegel’s conception of thought (in the context of logic) thus of necessity also included the process of the ‘objectification of thought’ (_VVergegenständlichung oder Entäusserung des Denkens_), i.e. its sense-object, practical realisation through action, in sensuous-physical material, in the world of sensuously contemplated (intuited) things. Practice, the process of activity on sense objects that altered things in accordance with a concept, in accordance with plans matured in the womb of subjective thought, began to be considered here as just as important a level in the development of thought and understanding, as the subjective-mental act of reasoning (according to the rules) expressed in speech.

Hegel thus directly introduced practice into logic, and made a fundamental advance in the understanding of thought and in the science of thought.

Since thought outwardly expressed itself _(sich entäussert, sich entfremdet_, i.e. ‘alienates itself’, ‘makes itself something outside itself’) not only in the form of speech but also in real actions and in people’s deeds, it could be judged much better ‘by its fruits’ than by the notions that it created about itself. Thought, therefore, that was realised in people’s actual actions also proved to be the true criterion of the correctness of those subjective-mental acts that were outwardly expressed only in words, in speeches, and in books.

### 5: Modern life and social reality  
Labour, Alienation & the Power of the Market

In the _System der Sittlichkeit_ and the two versions of the _Realphilosophie_ Hegel introduces for the first time his theory of what he would later call 'objective spirit', though the _Realphilosophie_ contains also much else. [**[13]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#13) Both sets of texts remained unpublished in Hegel's own lifetime. The _System der Sittlichkeit,_ composed around 1802-3, was published in its entirety for the first time by Lasson in 1913, though an earlier incomplete version was published by Mollat in 1893. The two versions of lectures known as _Realphilosophie_ I and II, delivered by Hegel at Jena University in 1803-4 and 1805-6 respectively, were published by Hoffmeister for the first time in the early 1930s.

A careful analysis of these two sets of texts, unknown to most of Hegel's traditional commentators, shows that while Hegel's main concern was always the attempt to achieve a comprehensive system of general philosophical speculation, his preoccupation with problems of a social and political nature consistently remained as the focus of his theoretical interest. These texts also point to a remarkable continuity in his political thought and clearly show that the political philosophy of the [_Philosophy of Right_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prconten.htm) cannot be understood in terms of a mere justification of the Restoration of 1815, since most of its themes and ideas go back to Hegel's thought during the Jena period. [**[14]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#14) Though the _System der Sittlichkeit_ and _the Realphilosophie_ differ on a number of issues, they will be treated jointly here.

The _System der Sittlichkeit_ tries to delineate the context within which a philosophy of social relationships can be justified. _Sittlich_keit, ethical life, is defined by Hegel as the identification of the individual with the totality of his social life. [**[15]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#15) What Hegel sets out to do is to describe the series of mediation; necessary for individual consciousness to find itself in this totality.

Hegel's point of departure is nature; consciousness' first moment is the realisation of its apartness and separateness from nature. This realisation dives rise to the impulse to overcome this separation, to integrate nature into oneself. Consciousness seeks its own recognition in its objects. This is the notion of need, in which the human subject relates to objects of nature and seeks to subsume them under his subjectivity and thus restore the primeval identity of subject and object. '.\Ian wants to devour the object, and Hegel projects this process in three stages: (a) need; (b) the overcoming and fulfilment of need; and (c) satisfaction." [**[16]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#16) Through satisfaction the individual achieves this transcendence of separation, but only on an immediate level: this satisfaction, in which the object is being destroyed, is purely sensuous and negative. It is limited to a particular object and cannot be generalised. The consciousness of separation remains after each individual act of subsumption.

The emergence of property is seen by Hegel as another attempt by man to appropriate nature to himself, but this time on a higher level, No longer is the natural object appropriated in order to be negated and destroyed; on the contrary, now it is being preserved.

But the significance of this appropriated object now no longer lies in its relationship to the appropriating subject, but rather in the fact that other Subjects recognise it as belonging exclusively to this one particular subject:

The right of possession relates immediately to things, not to a third party. Man has a right to take into possession is union as lie can as an individual. He has this right, it is implied in the concept of being himself: through this he asserts himself over all things. But his taking into possession implies also that he excludes a third. What is it which from this aspect binds the other? What may I take into my possession without doing injury to a third party? [**[17]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#17)

It is from these considerations that Hegel derives the trans-subjective, non-individual nature of property: _property pertains to the person as recognised by others,_ it can never be an intrinsic quality of the individual prior to his recognition by others. While possession relates to the individual, property relates to society: since possession becomes property through the others' recognition of it as such, property is a social attribute. Thus not an individualistic but a social premise is at the root of Hegel's concept of property, and property will never be able to achieve an independent stature in his system. This is significant because though Hegel's description of the economic process is taken, as we have already noted, from classical political economy, lie holds a totally different view about the basic nature of property. Property always remains premised on social consensus, on consciousness, not on the mere fact of possession.

Property is thus to Hegel a moment in man's struggle for recognition. [**[18]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#18) It does not derive from merely physical needs, and has thus an anthropological significance which it was always to retain in Hegel's philosophy. Yet there still remains an accidental element in possession, even when turned into property, since the objects of property relate to this or that individual in a wholly arbitrary way.

It is at this stage in his philosophical anthropology that Hegel introduces labour into his system. Only through labour, Hegel maintains, 'is the accidentality of coming into possession being transcended (_aufgehoben_)'. [**[19]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#19) Labour, to Hegel, is the sublimation of primitive enjoyment; in labour 'one abstracts from enjoyment, i.e. one does not achieve it The object, as an object, is not annihilated, but another is posited in its stead'. [**[20]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#20)

Labour is thus a mediated transcendence of the feeling of separation from the object; moreover, by its very nature, it is the locus of a synthesis of the subjective and the objective. The instrument of labour facilitates this mediation, and it is through labour that man becomes recognised by others. Labour is the universal link among men, 'Labour is the universal interaction and education (_Bildung_) of man . . . a recognition which is mutual, or the highest individuality'. [**[21]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#21) In labour, man becomes 'a universal for the other, but so does the other'. [**[22]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#22)

Labour appears then as the transformation of the appetites from their initial annihilative character to a constructive one: whereas primitive man, like the animals, consumes nature and destroys the object, labour holds up to man an object to be desired not through negation but through re-creation. While the goal of production is thus explained as recognition through the other, its motive is still need. Consciousness, by desiring an object, moves man to create it, to transform need from a subjective craving and appetite into an external, objective force. Labour is therefore always intentional, not instinctual for it represents man's power to create his own world. Production is a vehicle of reason's actualisation of itself in the world. In a passage which prefigures his later dictum about the rational and the actual, Hegel remarks that 'Reason, after all, can exist only in its work; it comes into being only in its product, apprehends itself immediately as another as well as itself'. [**[23]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#23)

But Hegel's views on labour as the instrumentality through which man acquaints himself with his world and thus develops both this world as well as himself is accompanied by a realisation that the conditions of labour postulate not only an actualisation of man but also his possible emasculation. To Hegel labour as practised in history has a double aspect. On the one band, it is the externalisation and objectification of man's capacities and potentialities: through labour, nature becomes part of the natural history of man: 'I have done something; I have externalised myself; this negation is position; externalisation _(Entäusserung)_ is appropriation.' [**[24]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#24) But labour also brines forth conditions which frustrate man's attempt to integrate himself into his world. This element of alienation in the process of labour is, to Hegel, not a marginal aspect of labour which can be rectified or reformed: it is fundamental and immanent to the structure of human society, and it is one of the characteristics of modern society that this element is being continually intensified. What we have in Hegel's discussion of this issue is one of the first most radical realisations that the development of modern society much as it is welcomed by Hegel - adds a further burden to the traditional predicaments of human life.

This vision of the workings of modern society does not come to Hegel through any empirical study of the social or economic conditions in his contemporary Germany. His account of these conditions in _The German Constitution_ certainly does not describe a vital, let alone active and productive society. Nor does he refer to other, more developed societies: Hegel's views here are rather a distillation of the model of society presented by modern political economy raised to the level of a philosophical paradigm. [That this was Hegel's point of departure was clearly realised by Marx, who wrote in his _Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts:_ '[Hegel's standpoint is that of modern political economy. He conceives labour as the essence, the self-confirming essence of man.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/hegel.htm#44H9)' But since Marx was not acquainted with the unpublished texts of the _System der Sittlichkeit_ and the _Realphilosophie, he_ was not aware that Hegel did realise that labour entails alienation. Hence he mistakenly concludes that Hegel '[observes only the positive side of labour, not its negative side](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/hegel.htm#44H9)']. [**[25]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#25)

The problematic aspect of labour is bound up with its social nature, and is hence inescapable. We have seen that to Hegel labour is the mediation through which man is related to his fellow beings. Now Hegel adds a further dimension: in production, man produces not for himself, but, on a reciprocal basis, for others as well. Labour becomes social labour, and men's aims in the process of labour are not only their individual aims, but broader, trans-individual ones: 'Labour for all and the satisfaction of all. Everyone serves the other and sustains him, only here has the individual for the first time an individuated being; before that it has been only abstract and untrue.' [**[26]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#26)

Contrary to the atomistic, individualistic view of labour, which sees labour as primary and exchange as secondary and derivative, based on surplus, for Hegel labour is always premised on a reciprocal relationship, subsuming exchange under its cognitive aspects. No one produces for himself, and all production presupposes the other - hence a basic element of recognition is always immanent in labour.

Yet this reciprocity gives rise to a problem: though every human need is concrete, the totality of needs for which the totality of production is undertaken is abstract and cannot be concretely expressed until the whole process of production and distribution has been completed. Production thus becomes abstract and the division of labour appears related to the needs of production and not to the needs of the producers. Man produces not the objects of his own specific needs, but a general product which lie can then exchange for the concrete object or objects of his needs. He produces _commodities,_ and the more refined his tastes become, the more objects he desires which he cannot produce himself but can attain only through the production of more objects which be then exchanges. There thus appears a universal dependence of each human being on the universality of the producers and the character of labour undergoes a basic change:

Because work is being done for the need as an abstract being-for-itself, one also works in an abstract way ... General labour is thus division of labour, saving ... Every individual, as an individual, works for a need, The content of his labour [however] transcends _his_ need; he works for the satisfaction of many, and so [does] everyone. Everyone satisfies thus the needs of man, and the satisfaction of his many particular needs is the, labour of many others. Since his labour is thus this abstraction, he believes is an abstract self. or according to the way of thingness, not as a comprehensive, rich, all-encompassing spirit, who rules over a wide range and masters it. He has no concrete work: his power is in analysis, in abstraction, in the breaking up-of the concrete into many abstract aspects. [**[27]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#27)

The dialectical nature of social labour is thus evident: on the one hand, by creating sociability, a universal dependence of each on all, it makes man into a universal being. On the other hand, this reciprocal satisfaction of needs creates a hiatus between the concrete individual and his particular and concrete needs. By working for all, the individual does not work for himself any more; an element of distance and a need for mediation is consequently thrust between his work and the satisfaction of his needs. Social labour necessarily entails alienation:

Man thus satisfies his needs, but not through the object which is being worked upon by him; by satisfying his needs, it becomes something else. Man does not produce any more that which he needs, nor does he need any more that which he produces. Instead of this, the actuality of the satisfaction of his needs becomes merely the possibility of this satisfaction. His work becomes a general, formal, abstract one, single; he limits himself to one of his needs and exchanges this for the other necessities. [**[28]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#28)

This universal dependence of man on man, while bringing out man's universal nature, also creates a power over man which grows beyond his control; what men produce under these conditions are not the objects of their immediate desire, but commodities:

This system of needs is, however, formally conceived as the system of universal reciprocal physical inter-dependence. Nobody is for himself [regarding] the totality of his needs. His work, or any method whatsoever of his ability to satisfy his needs, does not satisfy it. It is an alien power _(eine fremde Macht),_ over which he has no control and on which it depends whether the surplus, which he possesses, constitutes for him the totality of his satisfactions. [**[29]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#29)

The more labour becomes thus divided and specialised, the more commodities can be produced; the more labour becomes removed from the immediate satisfaction of the producers, the more productive it becomes. Man thus achieves ever greater comfort at the price of ever greater abstraction and alienation in the process of production itself:

His labour and his possessions are not what they are for him, but what they are for all. The satisfaction of needs is a universal dependence of all on all; there disappears for everyone the security and the knowledge that his work is immediately adequate to his particular needs; his particular need becomes universal. [**[30]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#30)

The process of labour - originally man's recognition through the other, intended to create for each his own objective world - becomes a process over which man loses all control and direction. Man is far from being integrated into the objective world through creative consciousness, i.e. labour; the abstract nature of labour, together with the division of labour, makes him totally alien to this objective world. Hence Hegel comes to be troubled by the real conditions of factory labour, and his general anthropology of labour becomes social analysis. Quoting Adam Smith, Hegel says:

The particularisation of labour multiplies the mass of production; in an English manufacture, 18 people work at the production of a needle; each has a particular and exclusive side of the work to perform; a single person could probably not produce 120 needles, even not one ... But the value of labour decreases in the same proportion as the productivity of labour increases. Work becomes thus absolutely more and more dead, it becomes machine-labour, the individual's own skill becomes infinitely limited, and the consciousness of the factory worker is degraded to the utmost level of dullness. The connection between the particular sort of labour and the infinite mass of needs becomes wholly imperceptible, turns into a blind dependence. It thus happens that a far-away operation often affects a whole class of people who have hitherto satisfied their needs through it; all of a sudden it limits [their work], makes it redundant and useless. [**[31]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#31)

This analysis undoubtedly reveals Hegel as one of the earliest radical critics of the modern industrial system. Hegel goes on to point out the necessary link between the emergence of machinery and the intensification of alienation, and here again be takes a middle position between the idealisers of the machine and the machine-smashers: while recognising the alienation caused by the introduction of the machine, be sees it as a necessary element in the anthropological determination of modern society based on ever-increasing production. Originally, Hegel contends, tools were nothing else than the mediation between man and his external world; as such, they always remained a passive object in the hands of the producer. But,

In the same way, [the worker] becomes through the work of the machine more and more machine-like, dull, spiritless. The spiritual element, the self-conscious plenitude of life, becomes an empty activity. The power of the self resides in rich comprehension: this is being lost. He can leave some work to the machine; his own doing thus becomes- even more formal. His dull work limits him to one point, and labour is the more perfect, the more one-sided it is ... In the machine man abolishes his own formal activity and makes it work for him. But this deception, which he perpetrates upon nature ... takes vengeance on him.

The more he takes away from nature, the more he subjugates her, the baser he becomes himself. By processing nature through a multitude of machines, he does not abolish the necessity of his own labour; be only pushes it further on, removes it away from nature and ceases to relate to it in a live way. Instead, he flees from this negative livingness, and that work which is left to him becomes itself machine-like. The amount of labour decreases only for the whole, not for the individual: on the contrary, it is being increased, since the more mechanised labour becomes, the less value it possesses, and the more must the individual toil. [**[32]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#32)

[The parallels with Marx's description in the _Economic & Philosophical Manuscripts_ are, of course, striking (see _Early Writings,_ pp. 120-34). The major difference has, however, already been pointed out by Lukacs: while Hegel sees alienation as a necessary aspect of objectification, Marx maintains that alienation does not reside immanently in the process of production itself, but only in its concrete historical conditions. For Marx therefore, there exists the possibility of ultimate salvation, whereas for Hegel one will never be able to dissociate the cross from the rose of the present.]

The immanent link between division of labour, mechanisation and the alienating nature of labour becomes more and more the center of Hegel's argument:

Labour, which is oriented towards the object as a whole, is (being) divided and becomes particular labour; and this particular labour becomes more and more mechanical because its manifold nature is (being) excluded ... It becomes alien to totality. This method of working, which is thus divided, presupposes that the remainder of the needs were to be achieved through another fashion, since they have also to be worked out - through the labour of other men. In this emasculation (_Abstumpfung_) of mechanical labour there directly lies the possibility of separating oneself completely from it: because labour is wholly quantitative, without variety . . . something completely external ... It only depends upon it to find an equally dead principle of movement for it, a self-differentiating power of nature, like the movement of water, of the wind, of steam, etc., and the instrument turns into a machine. [**[33]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#33)

We thus have here, in one of the more speculative documents of German idealist philosophy, one of the most acute insights into the working of modern, industrial society: from an _a priori_ philosophical anthropology, Hegel moves on to incorporate the results of political economy into a Philosophical system - an attempt almost identical in its systematic structure with Marx's program forty years later. How many of Marx's later conclusions are already to be found, explicitly or implicitly, in Hegel's earlier texts would however require a separate discussion. [**[34]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#34)

Commodity-producing society, according to Hegel, needs also a universal, abstract criterion which can mediate between labour and the subject. This is money:

Those multiple labours of the needs as things must also realise their concept, their abstraction: their universal concept must also be a thing just like them, but [it must be] a universal, which represents all. _Money_ is this materially existing concept, the form of the unity of the potentiality of all the things relating to needs. Need and labour are thus elevated into this universality, and this creates in a great nation an immense system of commonality _(Gemeinschaftlichkeit)_ and mutual dependence, a life of death moving within itself (_ein_ _sich in sich_ _bewegendes Leben des Toten)._ This system moves hither and thither in a blind and elemental way, and like a wild animal calls for strong permanent control and curbing. [**[35]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#35)

The ultimate power in commodity-producing society is the power of the market: 'In this system the ruling [element] is the unconscious blind totality of needs and the methods of their satisfaction.' [**[36]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#36) The power of the market is connected with the transformation of the use value of objects into the exchange value of commodities. [**[37]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#37) Man's labour, which had been aimed at achieving both recognition through the other and power over objects, thus ultimately places man in a diametrically opposed condition of utter dependence and total impotence _vis-a-vis_ the powers which were created by him and his own subjectivity - but over which he bad now lost all control.

Hegel's account of commodity-producing society abounds with explicit references to the sociological structure of this society. Aspects of class-domination appear in a very prominent way in Hegel's description when he expresses his awareness of the fact that the wealth of nations can be built only at the expense of the poverty of whole classes: 'Factories and manufacturers base their existence on the misery _(Elend)_ of a class', he remarks .[**[38]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#38) And, in another context, his description is no less brutal in its candour: '[This power] condemns a multitude to a raw life and to dullness in labour and poverty, so that others could amass fortunes.' [**[39]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#39)

The condition of poverty, in which this mass finds itself, is endemic to commodity-producing society: 'This inequality of wealth is in and for itself necessary', because wealth has the necessary, immanent tendency to accumulate and multiply itself. [**[40]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#40) [In these paragraphs Hegel speaks explicitly about 'the working class' _(die arbeitende Klasse,_ p. 498). It should be noted that only in referring to workers does Hegel use the modern term _Klasse,_ rather that the traditional _Stand_, which he uses when otherwise discussing social classes]. The power driving men to act in the market is infinite and knows no bounds:

Though it appears that enjoyment has to be something definite and limited, its infinity is its ideality, and in it it is infinite ... Cultured enjoyment, in overcoming the roughness of needs, must look to the noblest and most refined and adapt it, and the more differentiated its lustre, the greater the labour that is necessary for its production. [**[41]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#41)

From this Hegel draws the conclusion that wealth and poverty are interdependent and constitute two aspects of the Janus-like immanent forces of the market. The rapid expansion of the market necessitates ever-expanding and continually-changing needs. Again, in a rare insight into the dialectics of ever -changing demand creating pressure for ever-increasing production, Hegel says: 'Needs are thus multiplied; each need is subdivided into many; tastes become refined and differentiated. One demands a level of finish which carries the object ever nearer to its use.' [**[42]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#42)

Fashion becomes the determinant of production, and Hegel is thus one of the first thinkers who has grasped the internal logic of constantly-changing fashions and fads and its function within the productive process. The constant disquiet of concrete life in industrial society is here described from the consumer's point of view as well:

But this plurality creates _fashion,_ the versatility and freedom in the use of these things. The cut of clothes, the style of furnishing one's home, are nothing permanent. This constant change is essential and rational, far more rational than sticking to one fashion, imagining to find something permanent in such particular forms. The beautiful is not ordered by one fashion; but here we have to do not with free beauty, but with luxury that attracts ... Hence it has accidentality in it. [**[43]**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#43)

These fluctuations in taste have a bearing on the basic lack of security which characterises modern society. Whole sectors of the population live by the whim of a changing mode. Hegel's description of the conditions of life of these classes sinking into poverty is truly amazing when one reflects that Hegel reaches his conclusions through an immanent development of the consequences of the theories of political economy:

Whole branches of industry which supported a large class of people suddenly fold up because of a change in fashion or because the value of their products fell due to new inventions in other countries. Whole masses are abandoned to poverty which cannot help itself. There appears the contrast between vast wealth and vast poverty - a poverty that cannot do anything for itself ... Wealth, like any other mass, makes itself into a power. Accumulation of wealth takes place partly by chance, partly through the universal mode of production and distribution. Wealth is a point of attraction ... It collects everything around itself - just like a large mass attracts to itself the smaller one. To them that have, shall be given. Acquisition becomes a many-sided system which develops into areas from which smaller businesses cannot profit. The highest abstraction of labour reaches into the most particular types of labour and thus receives an ever-widening scope. This inequality of wealth and poverty, this need and necessity, turn into the utmost tearing up _(Zerrissenheit)_ of the will, an inner indignation (_Empörung_) and hatred. [**[44**](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/avineri5.htm#44), see [_Philosophy of Right_ § 244](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm#PR244)**]**

The ultimate consequences of these conditions then push the helpless mass of the poor into personal dependence upon the wealthy, who are their employers. Economic inequality calls for a situation of domination, and out of economic relations there emerges a dangerous pattern of inequality and power:

This necessary inequality ... causes through its quantitative constitution ... a relationship of domination. The enormously rich individual becomes a power, lie transcends the continuing physical dependence [which meant that one] depended upon a universal, not a particular [power].

Man's Promethean attempt has ended in shambles: the forces unleashed by his creative consciousness have become fetters, and the generality of human beings becomes enslaved by its own needs and by the modes of satisfying them.

13 Rosenzweig, _Hegel und der Staat,_ pp. 130ff. That _Realphilosophie_ I is an earlier attempt at a comprehensive system has recently been challenged: see the editor's remark to the new edition of _Realphilosophie_ II (Hamburg, 1967). We shall, however, follow the traditional way of referring to the two works involved as _Realphilosophie_ I and II.

34 In discussing Marx's views on the alienation of the worker in my _The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx_ (Cambridge, 1968) I referred, on pp. 55-56, to Adam Muller's and Franz von Baader's writings to show that the social consequences of industrial society were grasped by German thinkers well before Marx and the advent of industrialisation in Germany itself. At that time I was unaware of the extent to which Hegel dealt with these problems. In fact, his treatment not only antedates both Muller and von Baader, but is carried out in much greater detail and occupies a central position in the formation of his social philosophy - something that cannot be said for two other thinkers quoted by me. There is one further difference, of course: while Muller's and von Baader's writings were published, Hegel's discussions of this problem remained in manuscript, and were unknown to his contemporaries.

35 _Realphilosophie_ I, 239-40. In later years, Hegel coined the following aphorism about money: 'Money is the abbreviation of all external necessity' (_Berliner Schriften,_ p. 731). Again, the parallel with Marx's fragment 'On Money' _(Early Writings,_ pp. 189-94), as well as with Moses Hess' tract on the same subject, is very close.

36 _Schriften zur Politik,_ p. 493. Cf. p. 492: 'This value depends upon the totality of needs and the totality of surplus; and this totality is a power little known, unseen and incalculable.'

37 _Ibid._ P. 438: 'So this possession has lost its meaning for the practical feeling of the subject, is not any more a need for him, but [becomes] surplus; its relation to use is therefore a universal one.'

38 _Realphilosophie II,_ 257. Cf. p. 232: 'A mass of the population is condemned to stupefying, unhealthy, and precarious labour in factories, manufactures, mines, etc.'

39 _Ibid, II,_ 238.

40 _Schriften zur Politik,_ p. 495.

41 _Ibid._ pp. 494-5. Cf. p. 496: 'High wealth is likewise connected with the deepest poverty ... Labour becomes.. . on one side ideal universality, on the other really mechanical.' [_Philosophy of Right_ § 198](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm#PR198)

42 _Realphilosophie_ II, 231-2. The slightly censorious tone evokes echoes of Rousseau; but never does Hegel suggest that a recourse to a more simple, less differentiated society is feasible. The yearning for pristine simplicity, evident in both Plato and Rousseau, is totally absent in Hegel.

43 _Ibid._ II, 232.

44 Ibid. II, 232-3. It is extremely interesting to note that the term 'inner indignation' (_Empörung_) used here by Hegel, is the same he uses in the addition to [§ 244 of the _Philosophy of Right_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm#PR244) where he says that 'poverty in itself does not make men into rabble; a rabble is created only when there is joined to poverty a disposition of mind, an inner indignation against the rich, against society, against the government, etc.' Moreover, the only oblique reference in Marx to Hegel's discussion of poverty in the _Philosophy of Right_ is a fleeting hint that _Empörung_ is not enough; see K. marx/F. Engels, _The Holy_ Family, trans. R. Dixon (Moscow, 1956), p. 51.
